Time has proven that fooling yourself into believing a lie is the most effective way to deal with things you have no control over
Keep listening to the mixtapes they made you
Overanalyze every single word you hear
""Was this a sign that things were going wrong?""
No, no, you were the one who cared too hard, not them
Stay up every single night staring at your phone
Either attempting to gather up the courage to turn these demons
These constant reminders of your loneliness into nothing more than a bad dream
Or praying just for one second you could feel the warmth of equally returned love
Go out for coffee four times a week by yourself
Always bring your notebook, never stop writing
Leave little comics and thank you notes with your tip
Watch them smile as you get in your car
Talk down on yourself whenever possible
""My life is shit because I deserve it, right?""
You must have done something really bad;
It's nearly impossible for you to cry now
Avoid your friends for weeks even though they're the only sense of consistency you have left in your life
If they really wanted to see you, they'd come, but they won't
Who cares?"

Drug use in Kentucky is on the rise according to a new study by Millennium Health
The state ranks number one for percentage of fentanyl-positive drug tests in 2019
Fentanyl use often coincides with heroin, cocaine, or meth use in Kentucky, according to Millennium Health
[Verse]
Should I rap or should I stick to my addiction?
Should I trap or should I keep punchin' in credit card digits?
I'm trying to find another fiend, I'm in the kitchen
I got too many options, all of them come with a sentence
I heard they said the police on my trail, but I'm still livin' free (Where they at?)
Long live Heather, I'm a pill legend, I let her live through me
I think it's time for me to start givin' out pills for free
Here go a fake pill for you, I'm keepin' the real ones for me
I'll backdoor my own mans, don't be playing with me
In my traphouse, I got a couple fiends stayin' with me
It make it easier for me to make them get paper to me
I can show you how to make a mil' off pills, I'll tell you for free (Come on)
First, you want to get a real bag of Percocets
Pour them on a table, spread it out, see what you workin' with
This probably ain't for you if you ain't never seen or heard of it
You gon' have a couple hiccups, long live Heather, she's a murder kit
Okay, once you get the pills, you need Fentanyl
It's okay if you're running low on pills, we finna stretch them all
This the play, gather up all of the pills, we finna crush them all
If you're greedy, you can triple cut the pills like me, I need it all
Let me guess, you forgot to buy the pill presser?
Grab a piece to go punch it off Amazon 'cause the shipping is better
Grab a good one unless you don't care to make a new Heather
I'm tryna tear a happy family down, I can kill them together
Wear gloves, you gotta make sure you keeping it clean
Grab the Percocets and Fentanyl, put it in the machine, press the pill down and
stamp the M, get it right for the fiends
When you finish that, go to the hood, but don't start a big scene
Make sure they're dressed up like a bum, so you fit in the hood
Once you get clientele, start paying fiends to make sure that it's good
Tell them be a lookout because the police be all in the hood
Give a couple of samples out for free
They come back when it's good, but they can't come back when they dead
I got a strange addiction, I get really excited when they dead
I don't know where I would be at if I wasn't selling meds
Never mind, I'd probably be somewhere scamming, laying in bed"

A force running in every boy and girl
All rejoicing in the world
Take me now, we can try
We lived an adventure
Love in the summer
Followed the sun till night
Reminiscing other times of life
For each every other
The feeling was stronger
The shock hit eleven
Got lost in your eyes

You're gonna leave, but I know I try
Are you gonna leave me now?

Don't tell me not to live, just sit and putter
Life's candy and the sun's a ball of butter
Don't bring around a cloud to rain on my parade
Don't tell me not to fly, I've simply got to
If someone takes a spill, it's me and not you
Who told you you're allowed to rain on my parade?
I'm marching my band out, I'm beating my drum
And if I'm fanned out, your turn at bat, sir
At least I didn't fake it, hat, sir
I guess I didn't make it
But whether I'm the rose of sheer perfection
A freckle on the nose of life's complexion
The cinder or the shiny apple of its eye
I gotta fly once, I gotta try once
Only can die once, right, sir?
Oh, life is juicy, juicy and you see
I've gotta have my bite, sir
Get ready for me love, 'cause I'm a ""comer""
I simply gotta march, my heart's a drummer
Don't bring around the cloud to rain on my parade"

[Couplet 1]
Hier encore, j'avais vingt ans
Je caressais le temps, et jouais de la vie
Comme on joue de l'amour, et je vivais la nuit
Sans compter sur mes jours, qui fuyaient dans le temps
J'ai fait tant de projets, qui sont restés en l'air
J'ai fondé tant d'espoirs, qui se sont envolés
Que je reste perdu, ne sachant où aller
Les yeux cherchant le ciel, mais le cœur mis en terre
[Couplet 2]
Hier encore, j'avais vingt ans
Je gaspillais le temps, en croyant l'arrêter
Et pour le retenir, même le devancer
Je n'ai fait que courir, et me suis essoufflé
Ignorant le passé, conjuguant au futur
Je précédais de moi toute conversation
Et donnais mon avis, que je voulais le bon
Pour critiquer le monde, avec désinvolture
[Couplet 3]
Hier encore, j'avais vingt ans
Mais j'ai perdu mon temps à faire des folies
Qui ne me laissent au fond rien de vraiment précis
Que quelques rides au front, et la peur de l'ennui
Car mes amours sont mortes, avant que d'exister
Mes amis sont partis, et ne reviendront pas
Par ma faute j'ai fait le vide autour de moi
Et j'ai gâché ma vie, et mes jeunes années"

Cut through the heart, cold and clear
Strike for love and strike for fear

Split the ice apart
Beware the frozen heart"

Sans compter sur mes jours, qui fuyaient dans le temps
J'ai fait tant de projets, qui sont restés en l'air
J'ai fondé tant d'espoirs, qui se sont envolés
Que je reste perdu, ne sachant où aller
Les yeux cherchant le ciel, mais le cœur mis en terre

Je gaspillais le temps, en croyant l'arrêter
Et pour le retenir, même le devancer
Je n'ai fait que courir, et me suis essoufflé
Ignorant le passé, conjuguant au futur
Je précédais de moi toute conversation
Et donnais mon avis, que je voulais le bon
Pour critiquer le monde, avec désinvolture
[Couplet 3]
Hier encore, j'avais vingt ans
Mais j'ai perdu mon temps à faire des folies
Qui ne me laissent au fond rien de vraiment précis
Que quelques rides au front, et la peur de l'ennui
Car mes amours sont mortes, avant que d'exister
Mes amis sont partis, et ne reviendront pas
Par ma faute j'ai fait le vide autour de moi
Et j'ai gâché ma vie, et mes jeunes années"

Me dijiste ""hola""
Con una sonrisa, por cierto tan linda
Como el mismo cielo
Te puse nerviosa cuando por travieso te toque tu pelo
Era la primera vez que te miraba
Todo fue tan tierno
Nunca lo olvide
Te dije mi nombre
Me dijiste el tuyo y después charlamos unas cuantas horas
Hubo conexión desde el primer instante, te veías hermosa
Eras como un ángel y de puro gusto
Yo te di una rosa
Y te pregunté
[Coro]
Háblame de ti
De todos tus gustos, cuantos años tienes y a que te dedicas
¿Si sales con alguien?
Igual y con suerte te encuentras solita
¿Y dime que opinas?
Crees que exista el amor a primera vista
La verdad yo si
Háblame de ti
Cuéntame tus penas o si alguna vez alguien te ha lastimado
Si tu corazón por el momento es libre o ya está ocupado
Porque el mío creo que a partir de hoy
Alguien me lo ha robado
Y esa eres tú
Háblame de ti
Ojalá y me digas que estás disponible solo para mí"

Aah, aah-ah, aah-ah
Aah, aah, aah-ah, aah-ah
[Chorus]
Will you let me, baby, lose on losing dogs?
I know they're losing and I pay for my place
by the ring
Where I'll be looking in their eyes when they're down
I wanna feel it
[Bridge]
I bet on losing dogs
I always want you when I'm finally fine
How you'd be over me looking in my eyes when I come
Someone to watch me die, someone to watch me die"

[Verse 1]
I am not the only traveler
Who has not repaid his debt
I've been searching for a trail to follow again
Take me back to the night we met
And then I can tell myself
What the hell I'm supposed to do
And then I can tell myself
Not to ride along with you
[Chorus]
I had all and then most of you
Some and now none of you
Take me back to the night we met
I don't know what I'm supposed to do
Haunted by the ghost of you
Oh, take me back to the night we met
[Verse 2]
When the night was full of terrors
And your eyes were filled with tears
When you had not touched me yet
Oh, take me back to the night we met"

Tell me how you reach the moon

Come on and walk this way through the fire (Don't care what's on their mind)
And if you find yourself in a dark situation
Just turn on your light and be like

Say that shit with your chest, and
Be your own fuckin' best friend

Keep moving like, ""What's next?""

What you think, no, I won't hide
Underneath your own projections
Or change my most authentic life"
