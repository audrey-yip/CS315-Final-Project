1,21 Savage,née-nah,False,"I took a ballerina down to the ball dance
Met a couple ball players, found a ball stance
Now we in the bathroom, she found a ball face
Took some shots and balled out, now how the stall taste?
I can't even go inside, my old hoes might hear
I might need to hit the town, I need you right here, right here
'Til she reached in the trunk and found a nina
I told her, ""Baby, that's Nina Simone""
Ayy, drivin' through the liquor store faded, braided
Hands in this motherfucker wavin', hazy
'80s like the '90s and 2000s (Tuh-tuh-tuh-tuh-tuh-tuh-tuh)
Drivin' through this motherfucker, wildin'
Ayy, Brady seven pack, they come in bunch

Different presentation to this vibe, you need a keynote
Presi' 'round this motherfucker, I ain't sendin' vetos
Ain't no stoppin' shit or stoppin' licks, them boys on G-O
Battin' out the 504, I saved her name as ""Creole""
Balance when I'm on a road, I get the go and T-O
Dominatrix Matrix when she do it like I'm Neo
Shit is off its sockets, they lock in
Mama said live up to my name, but they jockin'
They gon' try go and take your face for the profit
They gon' lie, they gon' slip and slide, get beside ya
They gon' try, we a hundred deep like Verizon
In the trees with the bumble bees on horizon
Ain't catchin' Zs, I been in in the V, on road to Zion
Sell they souls, hoppin' in that mode that I ain't buyin'

Koliko auta ne moze se pasat' magistrala
Metropola turizma, kraljica mediterana
Žene u kupaći vanka sto pedeset dana
Niđe nema mjesta po kafana restorana
Ima tu svega i sa svija strana
Testosteron se nagomilava
Napetost u vazduhu, dešavaju se sranja
Što se tačno desilo pisaće dnevna štampa
Ma ne brini mala, oči moje plave
Pištolj je napunjen brale, stoji mi sa strane
Da mi te ko pipne za to padale bi glave
To bi bile scene užasa i strave
Pucam pe', šes' metaka u glavu i grudi
Fajront prije vremena, pobjegli su svi ljudi
Popaljena svjetla svi stanari budni
Gledaće na dnevnik pucačinu po Budvi

Boka kotorska, noć je, u Budvu na piće pođem
A poslije toga plan je da se ide na Lovćen
Ako sve dobro prođe možda ostanem ovđe
Po to pivo se popije ako nam konobar dođe
Bate, u Budvu na ljeto mi je najjači show
Da sam znao na vrijeme bih rezervisao sto
Ovako moram se gurat' isto kô zadnji mentol
Možda bih popio metak da nisam ponijô pištolj
Ovako mogu da pucaju, paljbu ja ću uzvraćat'
Pištolj mi je napunjen ako se s nekim posvađam
Auto je blindiran i s donje strane ojačan
U slučaj kad se parkiram da neko bombu mi bača
No se mnogo ne cimam, śednem u kola, šibam
Treća, peta brzina, murija ne smije grinjat'
Ako treba da se branim vazda ima načina
Da se puca sa pištoljem i sa mitraljezima

Od Bečića do Starog grada cukamo se kundakom
To je kultura nasilja, oružjem fascinacija
Unikatni spoj Rusa i Divljeg zapada
Providni ljudi iza zatamnjenih stakala
Ne skupljaju se sličice no čaure sa parkinga
Plastičnim pištoljem pođi dragstor da odradiš
Vratiš se sa vrata jer kasirka vadi pravi

38,Kinfolk Thugs,Who Gon Check It,False,"Yo, whaddup y'all, it's your man, KXNG Crooked
Check it out
You know what I'm about
I'm about the bars
I'm about the talent over politics
I'm about the culture
That's why I want y'all to check this new cypher out
It's the Worldwide Cypher Takeover
About to takeover the world with these bars
Let's watch


Let's talk about them subpar gun bars, gats and Glocks
Only strap that you got is your Apple Watch
If you're the worldwide cypher then
Youtube Volume 2 must've been rapped by some astronauts
'Cause this ain't worldwide, intergalactic
Got that bird's eye view over Earth likе the moon, what the fuck can I do?
Uh, this ain't nothing new
I came out the womb a killer like Goku
Them flows were so smooth, steady fed 'em soul food
This that old school era from nineties to '02
Potent fumes if you step in my room 'cause CO2
Smokes floor to ceilin', fillin' the whole booth, you're old news
Talkin' 'bout an L, but my Spotify's seven times bigger than those two
So, oh shoot, that was never beef, it was tofu
When steppin' in my arena, you get eatin'
No competin' when it comes to making good fuckin' music, I shine through
Bitch, let me remind you
Shady Records, Slaughterhouse, cosign what I do
So I pay no mind at the hatin' kind and the lazy guys
Where they go and get paid for the way that I take a line and I break it down eighty-nine times
Make it around so hot that my face is straight on fire used to pray to God
Till I became one, now I'm way on top, motherfucker, we ain't gon' stop, nah! (Hah!)
Ain't no one better than me, I'm a veteran, pen is elite
Every centimeter of the beat is defeated, I beat it up, eat it like bon apètit when we go to the feast
I'm a predator, y'all are just meetin', yeah, speakin' of beef, you're figurin' they're weak and vegan
I'll leave 'em with teeth in the spleen, and then they get to wheezin' and chokin', can't breathe (Brrt!)
Shoot my shot, Tory Lanez, up until his story changed
I don't shoot at feet, I leave a gory brain
Dark and messy, got 'em I'm sleepin' like narcolepsy
Till the narcs catch me
In the booth, more bars than a benchpress machine
Yeah, my words carry weight, cartels, I ain't talkin' barbells, uh
Claimin' that they killed it, but the beat was playin' possum shit
Me and all the squad now really made it posthumous (Yeah)
You might also like
Yeah
It's the motherfuckin' takeover... bitch


I'm tellin' artists it's stupid, they're tryin' cross with me (Huh?)
All for the king to a god but I got 'em on a tee (Tee)
Teeth hurt, y'all are too fake, need some Oral B (Huh?)
Y'all ain't gettin' laid, you get laced up if I'm on the feet (Brrat!)
Morbidly obese, personas will go to war with me ()
Fat boy, hungry for views, this dude will start a beef
Just so we could eat, brought the fire, I'll supply the grill
If I don't kill him on the beat, I know his diet will (World Wide League)
Better with me, just get up and leave (He's my bitch)
Get on your knees (Bars my prison), son of a bitch
Made my shiv with the ice on the wrist, tellin' my bitch I'ma kill her for streams (O. J. Simps')
All on my feed (Shift it and run), only go freeze (Ah!)
Flow is colder (Yeah), y'all ain't meet the quota (Nope)
Soldiers turn to fruit as soon as me and Grizzy rollup (Haha)
Barrin', hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, sick of signs you throw up
I show 'em up 'cause at they shows, not a soul would show up (Damn)
Callin' me the Em clone? You're losin' yourself
That's career suicide, homie shootin' himself
Because the dudes who got shooters could tell
You ain't a shooter yourself, dawg, be true to yourself (You pussy)
You a bitch, never hit the streets (No)
I said I'd never fight a pussy, I just flick the bean (Brrt)
Man, I didn't intervene when you dissed my dawg
So be gettin' me and take it with a grain of salt, you bitch (Ah!)

Man, I'm excited to write this track
Mum lost her house, I made a promise to buy it back (I'll buy it back)
And I ain't gonna let her down, I'm just climbing up through the ranks
And I bet that she's looking down like, ""Thank fuck that he good at something"", uh (Thank God)
I made it out of the house that was full of roaches
The clothes that I never chose but got handed down
My emotions were so overloaded, I could have overspoken at any moment
Took the path of drugs and just overdosed from a lethal dosage
All the chat about having gats in the trap, we don't condone it (We don't)
You got kids that look up to you and you still promote it
Glorifying killing and shooting people for any motive
Like murder is cool? Man, that shit is bogus
Enough of the chat, police are kicking the door of your flat, you've got to stash
'Cause you've got coke on the table, plus there's more in the back, fucked in a flash
Don't want to waste your life, especially not for the cash
Time is all I want 'cause I know it's the one thing I won't ever get back, yeah
You don't wanna be always running from sirens
Locked away, doing time, and stay surrounded by violence (No, you don't)
You should only focus on reaching early retirement
You don't have to become a product of your environment


Racism facin' the nation, wages, they pay for the slavery
Paper is chains so we're chasin' labor for change in our nature
Trainers are traitors that are made in basements full of wages
And places that are basic daycares for children on acres owned by dictators
But ayy, see the wave (Hi), long as the Nike's lookin' fresh
The truth is swooshed, does anybody check? (Hmm)
That's why I rap outside the box (Yeah)
Till the day that I'm wrapped inside the box (Ah) in a private plot
Suicidal thoughts try to find their mark, in the dark of the night, these bars are light
These scars are the right, fuck a heart, fuck a like, no filter, my brain flip forward
Give you all these grams of the buzz that can't be bustlin', I never gave a fuck
Why would I ever give a thought?
And all you rappers blamin' the beat? You stay defeated (True)
Just pass me the mic, I'll jack these sons, you can't beat it (Uh)
You can't come at me, that con dome will be bleedin', throw your shade, son, till you get heated
But yo, Samad, pass the rock, motherfucker
Who's at the door? It's Knox, motherfucker
I'll leave you in that hill, don't you plot, motherfucker
Don't fake with the ball, take your shot, motherfucker

I'm out
King shit

Look, hol' up, this here is major (Ah)
Cookin' up with my delivery, I should probably cater, but I'm not a waiter
But I'm bringin' shit to the table like solvin' equations
And if you ain't addin' up, know I'm carryin' one
Don't make me demonstrate it, I'm ill, so I illustrate the statement (Ah)
Understand what I feel like if you playin' the role, I'm not partakin' or participatin'
Flow on a hyperbolic chamber
Every minute I'm a day of trainin' is way up on me then pain
Let me get to the eyes and I'm in rhymin', take a look up at the past man, I've been grindin'
And I got up in this shit, no, I started the bottom of the bitch, with the flow mesmerizing
And wrecked your job and you tell me, ""I could go braggadocious or conscious""
Don't want no nobody get up in the middle of the battle
We be livin' in these cultural problems, I'm hella mad
They react to black like we predators (Yeah)
They make our homes the scene of the crime then hold us for evidence (Wack)
What it's like to be American? Daily prejudice, regimens
Pointin' they arrogance down the barrel they got us starin' in (Facts)
Resident, though it's evident, it's hard to live in this hell knowin' you heaven-sent (Yeah)
Just expressive shit, really compressin' it
Needs to aim towards that progressive shift, they ain't addressin' it
Computer thugs really gettin' capped, and we ain't pressin' shift (For real)
Look, told you I'ma keep climbin' over your noodle
Go for the top with this rhymin', no beef on my shit
King shit only, I promise, kingdom, we climbin'


Read in between the lines, nigga
King


Anybody want smoke, they gettin' flexed on
Niggas out here thinkin' they bad 'cause they chest drawn
Everybody's sayin', ""You simple, I ain't impressed, dawg""
Well, I don't really care about punchlines, I ain't attend prom
Only mobbin' for my kinfolk, drama never been known (Nope)
Pimpin' like Obama in a pinto
Anyone got problems, nigga, get low to click close
Unless there's no pressure, we throwin' logic out the window
Now you want gun bars, most do them wrong
'Cause dudes mad lost, like, ""Let me go and shoot at y'all""
""I got a gun so big it's like a blue RAV4""
Well, my nine's in the side pocket, nigga, my pool game's strong
Fuck everybody after me, I ain't givin' up
Nigga, I came up with nobody, so I ain't get no love
I'll be solo till I die, nigga, I'ma live it up
So if you feelin' there's an issue, homie, I don't give a fuck (Uh)


Bar heavy, I was forced to get a liquor license
They've been afraid 'cause they really know I've been the nicest Outright, I will out-write all you awful writers
Pen game tight, shit, I might got arthritis (Uh)
If I don't like you, I don't like you, ain't no sneak dissin'
Knock you out your shoes, you'll wake up and find your sneaks missin'
This is how we handle the beef, we eat different
See the heat, toss that shit back like I'm flee flickin'
I'm spittin' heat, you gotta see that shit with heat vision
I keep switichin' up the flow, they gettin' seasickness
My bread good like them Red Lobster cheese biscuits
If you know like I know, them shits is delicious
We don't rap alike, this a different appetite
You dudes fruity, you remind me of an apple slice
The way I run tracks, it's a fact I might have passed you twice
You ain't a rapper, you a preacher–pass the mic
If you was half as nice, you will understand I got the juice
I just poured my soul in it like a glass of ice
Any rapper go against Kufi is a sacrifice
Two things I never give is a bad verse or bad advice
Before you gamble with your life, you better pass the dice
Before you ask to see my demons, better ask for Christ
I caught that lil' nigga slippin' at the traffic light
Blow! Something 'bout to go down, I'm glad it's night


I heard Gats' in every verse, yo, I guess I've been summoned
So sub me in, I'm starvin', ain't no fuckin' ounce in my stomach
I've been counted out for years, now I'm 'bout to see summits
And I ain't ever begged for shit, ain't no colostomy, run it
Look, so many screamin' for change, but they never feed the meter
Artists get a morsel then deviate with a new demeanor
Even when they preach in remedial forward matters
When the benji's comin' in, they hit buttons and movin' backwards, ain't no dilo
It's about the bottom line, homie, this a free throw
Haters better step aside when I get in beast mode
Say you run the game, well, I'm really 'bout to repo
Snitches gettin' stitches, bitch, I never roll with Lilo
So I'm silently about it
I got the heart of a lion, and never back from the challenge
I lay low until you tell me I can't
I never needed your approval, I just needed a chance, it's Gats


You feel it creepin', the ill-i-ness be–
Ginin' to seep in, venom I release when I'm drillin' a beat
Chill with the Reaper, but still, it is me that is fillin' his dreams
You gonna be ready for bed, Freddy, when fake Kruegers get killed in their sleep?
Real when I speak, 'cause when I spit it's a movie, and it's my duty
To be flushed with the kind of crap that the rap game lacks when the shiznit isn't movin'
'Cause this to me what a list is to a 3D being that exists in 2D
Truly moving on a different level than everyone, they never want to listen to me
Snoop D-O double G, ooh-wee, what a nightmare, I want to smoke you weeds
You're sketchy, so to illustrate how I score on you the second you touchdown, I Drew Breeze
What's foul is to be playing like a chicken little, it'll bust out a two-piece
And in the cold and going to take shots on a line, when the only way to know how is to freeze
Who needs 'em a sockin'? I'm takin' off what I'm walkin' in and put a rock in it, they can all get it
Not dissin' if you're not with it, but I'm not finna bomb when I'm goin' off in it, off in it
Though too often it can all get twisted and all that
When this isn't dissin' at all, man, it's just what you'd call rap


They idolizin' the sire 'cause I'm providin' the wires
To blow this motherfucker off the hinge and stop the entire production
Make 'em say ""Fuck you,"" run home while sobbin' and cryin'
Hyenas laughin', they spotted, they meet the dominant lion
I tried to vibe with the cypher, Samad was droppin' the fire
A couple niggas was cool, some guys was awkward and tired
These substitute teacher lookin' niggas talkin' 'bout rhymin'
I leave these pussies for dead, then stick a fork in they hymen
Let the mac unload, crack his skull, quit the bag of 
Chattin' code, packin' .4s so we don't crack and fold
Trap a load, servin' motherfuckers like mac and rol'
And bangin' on 'em with the hammer, like whack-a-mole
Hol' up, let me chill, I'm hearin' they heart pumpin'
Thought they was big dogs, you puppies is far from it
And I feel like a track referee, so start stuntin'
On your mark, get set, when I shoot, they start runnin'
Murk


Y'all motherfuckers know what time it is
It's the Worldwide Cypher Takeover
And we 'bout to wrap it up like this
I go by the name of God Grizzy, let's go


What makes you think you the hottest? You too broke, don't wanna pay homage
With that logic, you should just go retire 'cause no one's coppin', please
Unless it's Carl Winslow rappin', don't get mad I'm blockin'
Get mad at these rappers droppin' all that traction
I think Oscar De La Hoya ain't no boxin' me in with that silly nonsense
Gotta get rich before I die, I need more commas and more dollars
For these bills, I got O'Reilly, never hottest, Samad was poppin'
Not no lip gloss or Lil Mama, I'ma shoot your ass a follow
After I body your beat and I ain't have to use the llama (Achoo)
Damn bro, you good?
Excuse me, I've been off this shit quite often when I'm off the meds like Marshall
Flow is out of this world like martians, we've been marchin', Malcom, Martin
Still ain't killers with no problem, now y'all killers with no conscience
Y'all talk knowledge then talk violence, is it Huey or y'all Riley?
Wrote this rhyme all in my boxers, I feel like Muhammad Ali
In an airplane with no pilot, goin' kamikaze
With Em and Bin Laden in the cockpit, so come and suck this cock, bitch
ASAP, it's rocky
Y'all ain't packin' peace unless you rap like geeks, it's Ghandi
I know we all got two sides, but damn, somebody lyin'
All these knowledge catchin' bodies but nobody dyin'
Stop it, some body gotta be lyin' somewhere where no one can find them
But I guess I love fake gun bars, this that shit y'all want, dawgs?
Snoopin' through y'all profiles and all I see some good guys, like that dog
That tough talk, make one call and they gone, no mumble rap too, fuck off
I know these niggas don't want war, so what the fuck would I run for?
No treadin' mills on this song
These bars goin' over your head, you monkeys get swung on
A difference between lyricists and rappers with good penmanship
Pedophiles with a pen, y'all be on that kiddie shit
Epstein flows, they gon' hang themselves in the end",Yo whaddup yall its your man KXNG Crooked Check it out You know what Im about Im about the bars Im about the talent over politics Im about the

40,Kinfolk Thugs,Back Seat (Pull It Over),False,"
I remember the first time I put my speakers in
Had my tweeters and mids balanced just to make ‘em blend
You could hear me 'fo I pull in
Ok, let the story begin



Woke up this morning with a hangover
Bottle after bottle when they came over
I guess today I’m just gone lay low
Won’t move unless I say so
Pay day, I got money to blow
You could say I’m balling with a budget ho
Chip on my shoulder and a point to prove
Fuck it I gotta make a move
Snapback, wife beater, and some levi’s
Adidas, grab the keys, we ride
Imma grip the wood grain, and stick to the leather
Gotta let the top back to enjoy the good weather
Eq the settings to balance the top
Bust so many blocks 'til my speakers get hot
No bass was the worst days
Now we got mo bass than the 80’s

And you can hear us coming when we roll through
Got the top let back on my old school
Seat let back like I’m so cool
Doin’ everything that a playa supposed to
And every time I crank it up I give it up to God
For giving me, everything in my ride
And every single thing I got in my life
So when I bend a corner I can bend it right
And you can hear us coming when we roll through
Got the top let back on my old school
Seat let back like I’m so cool
Doin' everything that a playa supposed to
Wit’ 1000 Watts



In the ’96 Impala wit’ the moon roof
I was a young nigga so I needed a young old school
Pull up to my old school
Got all the bitches starin’ like he so cool
Shout out to my nigga old school he put me up on game
Told me I could never crash when I’m in my own lane
Rollin’ up some propane, wit’ the windows cracked
Swearin’ that I got that sack, cause I roll 'em back to back to back
La familia read the tat, but it’s more than skin deep
Cruisin’ in my old school wit’ a fine slim freak
While I let my subs peak, at 1000 watts
I’m young and thuggin’ wit no shirt on beating down the block
Yeah
Speakers pop so I’m turnt to the max
Spraying blunt power so my whip won’t smell like that thrax
Calling me back like pookie
Got bass, but we only roll fruity, uh!


And you can hear us coming when we roll through
Got the top let back on my old school
Seat let back like I’m so cool

You lookin’ real suspicious mother fucka’
Better not try no shit you mother fucka’
I know you feel the bass, comin’ up off of the woofers
Police make a nigga turn it down, turn it back up when we shook em
Almost hit that pot hole, these streets so fucked up
Gotta keep a loaded heater up under the seat cuz
Niggas jackin’ just for practice, why you think they call it Jackson
Rather sip the henny wit the tinted windows, lettin’ yo baby mama relax me
Blowin’ lizard under AC speakers Ike Turner beat the back seat
Shawty say she got it from her mama, Imma mother fucker if you ask me
From 55 to 20 east, Slimm P shit super beats
Riding beatin’ through the neighborhood, ain’t nobody gettin’ no sleep
Knocking pictures off the wall ho’, bumpin’ that ’92 crown vic’
Nigga been talkin’ for 30 minutes wit the bass loud I ain’t heard shit
Actin’ like I’m in a video, bad bitches in my rear view
Gotta pull it over to the citgo, just to meet up wit Dolla my kinfolk


And you can hear us coming when we roll through, ( ahhhhhh naw )

Ich habe sie im Rolls gefickt (Hahahaha)
Ich bin im Ghost vorgefahren
Ich habe alle meine Ziele erreicht
Ja, ja, komme mit Yeezy und Dolla $ign
Ich kümmere mich nur ums Geschäft, ich kümmere mich um meins
Komm' in den Schützengräben auf wie Columbine
Komm' mit der Rakete hoch wie NumbaNine
Ich will deine Huren nicht
Der junge Nigga erreicht alle Ziele
Lass sie den Schwanz lutschen, sagte, sie sei ein Profi
Wenn sie sich die Zähne ausschabt, sag' ich ihr, sie soll gehen

Sie fährt damit wie auf Six Flags
Wir drehen auf bis zum Maximum
Ich haue sie von hinten
Ich habe der Schlampe einen Krampf verpasst
Sie lieben mich in Frankreich
Im Ghetto bin ich gut, ich bin abgestempelt
Jeden Tag ziehe ich mich ganz schwarz an
Für eine Show, neunhundert Taui
Anruf aus dem Nahen Osten, verdoppel das
In meinem Nacken ein Schaumbad
An meinem Handgelenk, ein neuer Cadillac
Spreche nicht mit ihr, ich will sie nicht zurück
Kleine Schlampe, ich bin ein Superstar
Diese Nutten wollen mein Auto ficken
Mein Hund hat einen Nigga in den Park gebracht
Ich muss mich vor den Niggeas in Acht nehmen, ey

Das ist Game of Thrones, Yeezy, nicht die Klone
Elon, wo ist mein Raketenschiff? Es ist Zeit, nach Hause zu gehen
Sie servieren uns den Porno seit dem Tag, an dem wir geboren wurden
Jeder, der angepisst ist, muss den Urin trinken
Jetzt bin ich Ye-Kelly, Schlampe, jetzt bin ich Bill Cosby, Schlampe
Jetzt bin ich reich wie Puff Daddy, das ist Auch-Ich-reich
Warum sagt sie, sie hätte meinen Schwanz gelutscht? Und dann sagt sie, sie hat meinen Schwanz nicht gelutscht?
Sie wird ihn in den Arsch nehmen wie ein Bauchredner
Ich meine, seit Taylor Swift, seit ich die Roli am Handgelenk hatte
Ich bin der neue Jesus, Schlampe, ich verwandle Wasser in Kristall
Das ist für das, was sie Chris angetan haben, sie können einen Scheiß damit machen
Habe meine Kinder in einer falschen Schule, wir sind nicht—

Sie reitet den Schwanz wie einen Karneval
Beug' sie vor, habe Flashbacks, sie wird mich auffressen wie ein Fleischfresser
Es ist die Art und Weise, wie ich meinen Scheiß platziere, die Huren sind nicht bereit, ich werde Seepocken
Ich bewege mich, ich fühle mich wie Jason, kann nicht verhaftet werden, ich lasse sie stampfen, oh
Sie will eine private Session, rollen die X's ab, wenn ich auf Melrose bin
Sie hat meinen Namen auf ihre Titten tätowiert, ja, du kannst es kaputt machen, aber es ist geliehen
Warte mal, ich sitze da und zähle die Dubs, ich bin im Bezirk aufgewachsen
Sie will es probieren, checkt die Beute heute, Hure, komm morgen wieder
Wenn du weißt, was ich weiß, versteck deine Hure
Nur wegen der Tatsache, dass wir diese Hunchos haben
In der Lobby rumlaufen, ich weiß, dass sie es satt haben, dass ich zehn Huren habe
Sie braucht ein paar Kresidenten, um Präsidentin zu werden, warte mal, warte mal
Ich bin dabei, ihr ein paar Zahnprothesen zu kaufen, lass diese Hure mich zum Abendessen essen, woah, woah
Schmerz in meinen Augen, ich kann nicht sehen, ah
Ich bin dabei, aus meinem Körper zu springen, ich bin bereit zu springen, ah
Ich bin kurz davor, auf ihren Körper zu spinnen und der Nutte zu sagen, sie soll verschwinden, okay
Fünfzig K in die Tasche gestopft, sag' es der ganzen Bande, ah
Es sind Ye und Barti, sag mir, wer mit uns fickt?
Ich bin heiß wie Tha Carter, ich fühle diese Hure in meinem Schlaf
Dollarzeichen in meinen Träumen, ich sehe nie Z's, woah (Woah-woah)

Got my space case but I'm sure that
All my friends fake 'cause they told me that
Shit wasn't real, it was all in my head, I imagined that
False sparks
Saw them hand-in-hand standing outside of a Wal-Mart
Now I'm sitting here wondering, when did this all start?
