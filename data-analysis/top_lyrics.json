Now, as Darius lay sick and felt that the end of life drew near, he wished both his sons to be with him. The elder, as it chanced, was already there, but Cyrus he must needs send for from the province over which he had made him satrap, having appointed him general moreover of all the forces that muster in the plain of the Castolus. Thus Cyrus went up, taking with him Tissaphernes as his friend, and accompanied also by a body of Hellenes, three hundred heavy armed men, under the command of Xenias the Parrhasian.\n\n Parrhasia, a district and town in the south-west of Arcadia.\n\nNow when Darius was dead, and Artaxerxes was established in the kingdom, Tissaphernes brought slanderous accusations against Cyrus before his brother, the king, of harbouring designs against him. And Artaxerxes, listening to the words of Tissaphernes, laid hands upon Cyrus, desiring to put him to death; but his mother made intercession for him, and sent him back again in safety to his province. He then, having so escaped through peril and dishonour, fell to considering, not only how he might avoid ever again being in his brother's power, but how, if possible, he might become king in his stead. Parysatis, his mother, was his first resource; for she had more love for Cyrus than for Artaxerxes upon his throne. Moreover Cyrus's behaviour towards all who came to him from the king's court was such that, when he sent them away again, they were better friends to himself than to 5 the king his brother. Nor did he neglect the barbarians in his own service; but trained them, at once to be capable as warriors and devoted adherents of himself. Lastly, he began collecting his Hellenic armament, but with the utmost secrecy, so that he might take the king as far as might be at unawares.\n\nThe manner in which he contrived the levying of the troops was as follows: First, he sent orders to the commandants of garrisons in the cities (so held by him), bidding them to get together as large a body of picked Peloponnesian troops as they severally were able, on the plea that Tissaphernes was plotting against their cities; and truly these cities of Ionia had originally belonged to Tissaphernes, being given to him by the king; but at this time, with the exception of Miletus, they had all revolted to Cyrus. In Miletus, Tissaphernes, having become aware of similar designs, had forestalled the conspirators by putting some to death and banishing the remainder. Cyrus, on his side, welcomed these fugitives, and having collected an army, laid siege to Miletus by sea and land, endeavouring to reinstate the exiles; and this gave him another pretext for collecting an armament. At the same time he sent to the king, and claimed, as being the king's brother, that these cities should be given to himself rather than that Tissaphernes should continue to govern them; and in furtherance of this end, the queen, his mother, co-operated with him, so that the king not only failed to see the design against himself, but concluded that Cyrus was spending his money on armaments in order to make war on Tissaphernes. Nor did it pain him greatly to see the two at war together, and the less so because Cyrus was careful to remit the tribute due to the king from the cities which belonged to Tissaphernes.\n\nA third army was being collected for him in the Chersonese, over against Abydos, the origin of which was as follows: There was a Lacedaemonian exile, named Clearchus, with whom Cyrus had become associated. Cyrus admired the man, and made him a present of ten thousand darics. Clearchus took the gold, and with the money raised 9 an army, and using the Chersonese as his base of operations, set to work to fight the Thracians north of the Hellespont, in the interests of the Hellenes, and with such happy result that the Hellespontine cities, of their own accord, were eager to contribute funds for the support of his troops. In this way, again, an armament was being secretly maintained for Cyrus.\n\n A Persian gold coin = 125.55 grains of gold.\n\nThen there was the Thessalian Aristippus, Cyrus's friend, who, under pressure of the rival political party at home, had come to Cyrus and asked him for pay for two thousand mercenaries, to be continued for three months, which would enable him, he said, to gain the upper hand of his antagonists. Cyrus replied by presenting him with six months' pay for four thousand mercenaries--only stipulating that Aristippus should not come to terms with his antagonists without final consultation with himself. In this way he secured to himself the secret maintenance of a fourth armament.\n\n Lit. \"guest-friend.\" Aristippus was, as we learn from the \"Meno\" of Plato, a native of Larisa, of the family of the Aleuadae, and a pupil of Gorgias. He was also a lover of Menon, whom he appears to have sent on this expedition instead of himself.\n\nFurther, he bade Proxenus, a Boeotian, who was another friend, get together as many men as possible, and join him in an expedition which he meditated against the Pisidians, who were causing annoyance to his territory. Similarly two other friends, Sophaenetus the Stymphalian, and Socrates the Achaean, had orders to get together as many men as possible and come to him, since he was on the point of opening a campaign, along with Milesian exiles, against Tissaphernes. These orders were duly carried out by the officers in question.\n\n Lit. \"into the country of the Pisidians.\"\n\n Of Stymphalus in Arcadia.\n\nII\nBut when the right moment seemed to him to have come, at which he 1 should begin his march into the interior, the pretext which he put forward was his desire to expel the Pisidians utterly out of the country; and he began collecting both his Asiatic and his Hellenic armaments, avowedly against that people. From Sardis in each direction his orders sped: to Clearchus, to join him there with the whole of his army; to Aristippus, to come to terms with those at home, and to despatch to him the troops in his employ; to Xenias the Arcadian, who was acting as general-in-chief of the foreign troops in the cities, to present himself with all the men available, excepting only those who were actually needed to garrison the citadels. He next summoned the troops at present engaged in the siege of Miletus, and called upon the exiles to follow him on his intended expedition, promising them that if he were successful in his object, he would not pause until he had reinstated them in their native city. To this invitation they hearkened gladly; they believed in him; and with their arms they presented themselves at Sardis. So, too, Xenias arrived at Sardis with the contingent from the cities, four thousand hoplites; Proxenus, also, with fifteen hundred hoplites and five hundred light-armed troops; Sophaenetus the Stymphalian, with one thousand hoplites; Socrates the Achaean, with five hundred hoplites; while the Megarion Pasion came with three hundred hoplites and three hundred peltasts. This latter officer, as well as Socrates, belonged to the force engaged against Miletus. These all joined him at Sardis.\n\n \"Targeteers\" armed with a light shield instead of the larger one of the hoplite, or heavy infantry soldier. Iphicrates made great use of this arm at a later date.\n\nBut Tissaphernes did not fail to note these proceedings. An equipment so large pointed to something more than an invasion of Pisidia: so he argued; and with what speed he might, he set off to the king, attended by about five hundred horse. The king, on his side, had no sooner heard from Tissaphernes of Cyrus's great armament, than he began to make counter-preparations.\n\nThus Cyrus, with the troops which I have named, set out from Sardis, and marched on and on through Lydia three stages, making two-and-twenty parasangs, to the river Maeander. That river is two hundred feet broad, and was spanned by a bridge consisting of seven boats. Crossing it, he marched through Phrygia a single stage, of eight parasangs, to Colossae, an inhabited city, prosperous and 6 large. Here he remained seven days, and was joined by Menon the Thessalian, who arrived with one thousand hoplites and five hundred peltasts, Dolopes, Aenianes, and Olynthians. From this place he marched three stages, twenty parasangs in all, to Celaenae, a populous city of Phrygia, large and prosperous. Here Cyrus owned a palace and a large park full of wild beasts, which he used to hunt on horseback, whenever he wished to give himself or his horses exercise. Through the midst of the park flows the river Maeander, the sources of which are within the palace buildings, and it flows through the city of Celaenae. The great king also has a palace in Celaenae, a strong place, on the sources of another river, the Marsyas, at the foot of the acropolis. This river also flows through the city, discharging itself into the Maeander, and is five-and-twenty feet broad. Here is the place where Apollo is said to have flayed Marsyas, when he had conquered him in the contest of skill. He hung up the skin of the conquered man, in the cavern where the spring wells forth, and hence the name of the river, Marsyas. It was on this site that Xerxes, as tradition tells, built this very palace, as well as the citadel of Celaenae itself, on his retreat from Hellas, after he had lost the famous battle. Here Cyrus remained for thirty days, during which Clearchus the Lacedaemonian arrived with one thousand hoplites and eight hundred Thracian peltasts and two hundred Cretan archers. At the same time, also, came Sosis the Syracusian with three thousand hoplites, and Sophaenetus the Arcadian with one thousand hoplites; and here Cyrus held a review, and numbered his Hellenes in the park, and found that they amounted in all to eleven thousand hoplites and about two thousand peltasts.\n\n The Persian \"farsang\" = 30 stades, nearly 1 league, 3 1/2 statute miles, though not of uniform value in all parts of Asia.\n\n \"Two plethra\": the plethron = about 101 English feet.\n\n Lit. \"inhabited,\" many of the cities of Asia being then as now deserted, but the suggestion is clearly at times \"thickly inhabited,\" \"populous.\"\n\n Lit. \"paradise,\" an oriental word = park or pleasure ground.\n\n Perhaps this should be Agias the Arcadian, as Mr. Macmichael suggests. Sophaenetus has already been named above.\n\nFrom this place he continued his march two stages--ten parasangs--to 10 the populous city of Peltae, where he remained three days; while Xenias, the Arcadian, celebrated the Lycaea with sacrifice, and instituted games. The prizes were headbands of gold; and Cyrus himself was a spectator of the contest. From this place the march was continued two stages--twelve parasangs--to Ceramon-agora, a populous city, the last on the confines of Mysia. Thence a march of three stages--thirty parasangs--brought him to Caystru-pedion, a populous city. Here Cyrus halted five days; and the soldiers, whose pay was now more than three months in arrear, came several times to the palace gates demanding their dues; while Cyrus put them off with fine words and expectations, but could not conceal his vexation, for it was not his fashion to stint payment, when he had the means. At this point Epyaxa, the wife of Syennesis, the king of the Cilicians, arrived on a visit to Cyrus; and it was said that Cyrus received a large gift of money from the queen. At this date, at any rate, Cyrus gave the army four months' pay. The queen was accompanied by a bodyguard of Cilicians and Aspendians; and, if report speaks truly, Cyrus had intimate relations with the queen.\n\n The Lycaea, an Arcadian festival in honour of Zeus {Arcaios}, akin to the Roman Lupercalia, which was originally a shepherd festival, the introduction of which the Romans ascribe to the Arcadian Evander.\n\n Lit. \"plain of the Cayster,\" like Ceramon-agora, \"the market of the Ceramians\" above, the name of a town.\n\nFrom this place he marched two stages--ten parasangs--to Thymbrium, a populous city. Here, by the side of the road, is the spring of Midas, the king of Phrygia, as it is called, where Midas, as the story goes, caught the satyr by drugging the spring with wine. From this place he marched two stages--ten parasangs--to Tyriaeum, a populous city. Here he halted three days; and the Cilician queen, according to the popular account, begged Cyrus to exhibit his armament for her amusement. The latter being only too glad to make such an exhibition, held a review of the Hellenes and barbarians in the plain. He ordered the Hellenes to draw up their lines and post themselves in their customary battle order, each general marshalling his own battalion. Accordingly they drew up four-deep. The right was held by Menon and those with him; the 15 left by Clearchus and his men; the centre by the remaining generals with theirs. Cyrus first inspected the barbarians, who marched past in troops of horses and companies of infantry. He then inspected the Hellenes; driving past them in his chariot, with the queen in her carriage. And they all had brass helmets and purple tunics, and greaves, and their shields uncovered.\n I.e. ready for action, c.f. \"bayonets fixed\".\n\nAfter he had driven past the whole body, he drew up his chariot in front of the centre of the battle-line, and sent his interpreter Pigres to the generals of the Hellenes, with orders to present arms and to advance along the whole line. This order was repeated by the generals to their men; and at the sound of the bugle, with shields forward and spears in rest, they advanced to meet the enemy. The pace quickened, and with a shout the soldiers spontaneously fell into a run, making in the direction of the camp. Great was the panic of the barbarians. The Cilician queen in her carriage turned and fled; the sutlers in the marketing place left their wares and took to their heels; and the Hellenes meanwhile came into camp with a roar of laughter. What astounded the queen was the brilliancy and order of the armament; but Cyrus was pleased to see the terror inspired by the Hellenes in the hearts of the Asiatics.\n\nFrom this place he marched on three stages--twenty parasangs--to Iconium, the last city of Phrygia, where he remained three days. Thence he marched through Lycaonia five stages--thirty parasangs. This was hostile country, and he gave it over to the Hellenes to pillage. At this point Cyrus sent back the Cilician queen to her own country by the quickest route; and to escort her he sent the soldiers of Menon, and Menon himself. With the rest of the troops he continued his march through Cappadocia four stages--twenty-five parasangs--to Dana, a populous city, large and flourishing. Here they halted three days, within which interval Cyrus put to death, on a charge of conspiracy, a Persian nobleman named Megaphernes, a wearer of the royal purple; and along with him another high dignitary among his subordinate commanders.\n\nFrom this place they endeavoured to force a passage into Cilicia. Now 21 the entrance was by an exceedingly steep cart-road, impracticable for an army in face of a resisting force; and report said that Syennesis was on the summit of the pass guarding the approach. Accordingly they halted a day in the plain; but next day came a messenger informing them that Syenesis had left the pass; doubtless, after perceiving that Menon's army was already in Cilicia on his own side of the mountains; and he had further been informed that ships of war, belonging to the Lacedaemonians and to Cyrus himself, with Tamos on board as admiral, were sailing round from Ionia to Cilicia. Whatever the reason might be, Cyrus made his way up into the hills without let or hindrance, and came in sight of the tents where the Cilicians were on guard. From that point he descended gradually into a large and beautiful plain country, well watered, and thickly covered with trees of all sorts and vines. This plain produces sesame plentifully, as also panic and millet and barley and wheat; and it is shut in on all sides by a steep and lofty wall of mountains from sea to sea. Descending through this plain country, he advanced four stages--twenty-five parasangs--to Tarsus, a large and prosperous city of Cilicia. Here stood the palace of Syennesis, the king of the country; and through the middle of the city flows a river called the Cydnus, two hundred feet broad. They found that the city had been deserted by its inhabitants, who had betaken themselves, with Syennesis, to a strong place on the hills. All had gone, except the tavern-keepers. The sea-board inhabitants of Soli and Issi also remained. Now Epyaxa, Syennesis's queen, had reached Tarsus five days in advance of Cyrus. During their passage over the mountains into the plain, two companies of Menon's army were lost. Some said they had been cut down by the Cilicians, while engaged on some pillaging affair; another account was that they had been left behind, and being unable to overtake the main body, or discover the route, had gone astray and perished. However it was, they numbered one hundred hoplites; and when the rest arrived, being in a fury at the destruction of their fellow soldiers, they vented their spleen by pillaging the city of Tarsus and the palace to boot. Now when Cyrus had marched into the city, he sent for Syennesis to come to him; but 26 the latter replied that he had never yet put himself into the hands of any one who was his superior, nor was he willing to accede to the proposal of Cyrus now; until, in the end, his wife persuaded him, and he accepted pledges of good faith. After this they met, and Syennesis gave Cyrus large sums in aid of his army; while Cyrus presented him with the customary royal gifts--to wit, a horse with a gold bit, a necklace of gold, a gold bracelet, and a gold scimitar, a Persian dress, and lastly, the exemption of his territory from further pillage, with the privilege of taking back the slaves that had been seized, wherever they might chance to come upon them.\n\nIII\n\nAt Tarsus Cyrus and his army halted for twenty days; the soldiers 1 refusing to advance further, since the suspicion ripened in their minds, that the expedition was in reality directed against the king; and as they insisted, they had not engaged their services for that object. Clearchus set the example of trying to force his men to continue their march; but he had no sooner started at the head of his troops than they began to pelt him and his baggage train, and Clearchus had a narrow escape of being stoned to death there and then. Later on, when he perceived that force was useless, he summoned an assembly of his own men; and for a long while he stood and wept, while the men gazed in silent astonishment. At last he spoke as follows: \"Fellow soldiers, do not marvel that I am sorely distressed on account of the present troubles. Cyrus has been no ordinary friend to me. When I was in banishment he honoured me in various ways, and made me also a present of ten thousand darics. These I accepted, but not to lay them up for myself for private use; not to squander them in pleasure, but to expend them on yourselves. And, first of all, I went to war with the Thracians, and with you to aid, I wreaked vengeance on them in behalf of Hellas; driving them out of the Chersonese, when they wanted to deprive its Hellenic inhabitants of their lands. But as soon as Cyrus summoned me, I took you with me and set out, so that, if my benefactor had any need of me, I might requite him for the good treatment I myself had received at his hands. . . . But since you are not minded to continue the march with me, one of two things is left to 5 me to do; either I must renounce you for the sake of my friendship with Cyrus, or I must go with you at the cost of deceiving him. Whether I am about to do right or not, I cannot say, but I choose yourselves; and, whatever betide, I mean to share your fate. Never shall it be said of me by any one that, having led Greek troops against the barbarians, I betrayed the Hellenes, and chose the friendship of the barbarian. No! since you do not choose to obey and follow me, I will follow after you. Whatever betide, I will share your fate. I look upon you as my country, my friends, my allies; with you I think I shall be honoured, wherever I be; without you I do not see how I can help a friend or hurt a foe. My decision is taken. Wherever you go, I go also.\"\n\n Lit. \"into the country of the barbarian.\"\n\nSuch were his words. But the soldiers, not only his own, but the rest also, when they heard what he said, and how he had scouted the idea of going up to the great king's palace, expressed their approval; and more than two thousand men deserted Xenias and Pasion, and took their arms and baggage-train, and came and encamped with Clearchus. But Cyrus, in despair and vexation at this turn of affairs, sent for Clearchus. He refused to come; but, without the knowledge of the soldiers, sent a message to Cyrus, bidding him keep a good heart, for that all would arrange itself in the right way; and bade him keep on sending for him, whilst he himself refused to go. After that he got together his own men, with those who had joined him, and of the rest any who chose to come, and spoke as follows: \"Fellow soldiers, it is clear that the relations of Cyrus to us are identical with ours to him. We are no longer his soldiers, since we have ceased to follow him; and he, on his side, is no longer our paymaster. He, however, no doubt considers himself wronged by us; and though he goes on sending for me, I cannot bring myself to go to him: for two reasons, chiefly from a sense of shame, for I am forced to admit to myself that I have altogether deceived him; but partly, too, because I am afraid of his seizing me and inflicting a penalty on the wrongs which he conceives 11 that I have done him. In my opinion, then, this is no time for us to go to sleep and forget all about ourselves, rather it is high time to deliberate on our next move; and as long as we do remain here, we had better bethink us how we are to abide in security; or, if we are resolved to turn our backs at once, what will be the safest means of retreat; and, further, how we are to procure supplies, for without supplies there is no profit whatsoever in the general or the private soldier. The man with whom we have to deal is an excellent friend to his friends, but a very dangerous enemy to his foes. And he is backed by a force of infantry and cavalry and ships such as we all alike very well see and know, since we can hardly be said to have posted ourselves at any great distance from him. If, then, any one has a suggestion to make, now is the time to speak.\" With these words he ceased.\n\n Or \"how he insisted that he was not going up.\"\n\nThen various speakers stood up; some of their own motion to propound their views; others inspired by Clearchus to dilate on the hopeless difficulty of either staying, or going back without the goodwill of Cyrus. One of these, in particular, with a make-believe of anxiety to commence the homeward march without further pause, called upon them instantly to choose other generals, if Clearchus were not himself prepared to lead them back: \"Let them at once purchase supplies\" (the market being in the heart of the Asiatic camp), \"let them pack up their baggage: let them,\" he added, \"go to Cyrus and ask for some ships in order to return by sea: if he refused to give them ships, let them demand of him a guide to lead them back through a friendly district; and if he would not so much as give them a guide, they could but put themselves, without more ado, in marching order, and send on a detachment to occupy the pass--before Cyrus and the Cilicians, whose property,\" the speaker added, \"we have so plentifully pillaged, can anticipate us.\" Such were the remarks of that speaker; he was followed by Clearchus, who merely said: \"As to my acting personally as general at this season, pray do not propose it: I can see numerous obstacles to my doing so. Obedience, in the fullest, I can render to the man of 15 your choice, that is another matter: and you shall see and know that I can play my part, under command, with the best of you.\"\n\nAfter Clearchus another spokesman stood up, and proceeded to point out the simplicity of the speaker, who proposed to ask for vessels, just as if Cyrus were minded to renounce the expedition and sail back again. \"And let me further point out,\" he said, \"what a simple-minded notion it is to beg a guide of the very man whose designs we are marring. If we can trust any guide whom Cyrus may vouchsafe to us, why not order Cyrus at once to occupy the pass on our behoof? For my part, I should think twice before I set foot on any ships that he might give us, for fear lest he should sink them with his men-of-war; and I should equally hesitate to follow any guide of his: he might lead us into some place out of which we should find it impossible to escape. I should much prefer, if I am to return home against the will of Cyrus at all, to give him the slip, and so begone: which indeed is impossible. But these schemes are simply nonsensical. My proposal is that a deputation of fit persons, with Clearchus, should go to Cyrus: let them go to Cyrus and ask him: what use he proposes to make of us? and if the business is at all similar to that on which he once before employed a body of foreigners--let us by all means follow: let us show that we are the equals of those who accompanied him on his much up formerly. But if the design should turn out to be of larger import than the former one--involving more toil and more danger--we should ask him, either to give us good reasons for following his lead, or else consent to send us away into a friendly country. In this way, whether we follow him, we shall do so as friends, and with heart and soul, or whether we go back, we shall do so in security. The answer to this shall be reported to us here, and when we have heard it, we will advise as to our best course.\"\n\nThis resolution was carried, and they chose and sent a deputation with Clearchus, who put to Cyrus the questions which had been agreed upon by the army. Cyrus replied as follows: That he had received news that Abrocomas, an enemy of his, was posted on the Euphrates, twelve stages 20 off; his object was to march against this aforesaid Abrocomas: and if he were still there, he wished to inflict punishment on him, \"or if he be fled\" (so the reply concluded), \"we will there deliberate on the best course.\" The deputation received the answer and reported it to the soldiers. The suspicion that he was leading them against the king was not dispelled; but it seemed best to follow him. They only demanded an increase of pay, and Cyrus promised to give them half as much again as they had hitherto received--that is to say, a daric and a half a month to each man, instead of a daric. Was he really leading them to attack the king? Not even at this moment was any one apprised of the fact, at any rate in any open and public manner.\n\nIV\nFrom this point he marched two stages--ten parasangs--to the river 1 Psarus, which is two hundred feet broad, and from the Psarus he marched a single stage--five parasangs--to Issi, the last city in Cilicia. It lies on the seaboard--a prosperous, large and flourishing town. Here they halted three days, and here Cyrus was joined by his fleet. There were thirty-five ships from Peloponnesus, with the Lacedaemonian admiral Pythagoras on board. These had been piloted from Ephesus by Tamos the Egyptian, who himself had another fleet of twenty-five ships belonging to Cyrus. These had formed Tamos's blockading squadron at Miletus, when that city sided with Tissaphernes; he had also used them in other military services rendered to Cyrus in his operations against that satrap. There was a third officer on board the fleet, the Lacedaemonian Cheirisophus, who had been sent for by Cyrus, and had brought with him seven hundred hoplites, over whom he was to act as general in the service of Cyrus. The fleet lay at anchor opposite Cyrus's tent. Here too another reinforcement presented itself. This was a body of four hundred hoplites, Hellenic mercenaries in the service of Abrocomas, who 3 deserted him for Cyrus, and joined in the campaign against the king.\n\nFrom Issi, he marched a single stage--five parasangs--to the gates of Cilicia and Syria. This was a double fortress: the inner and nearer one, which protects Cilicia, was held by Syennesis and a garrison of Cilicians; the outer and further one, protecting Syria, was reported to be garrisoned by a body of the king's troops. Through the gap between the two fortresses flows a river named the Carsus, which is a hundred feet broad, and the whole space between was scarcely more than six hundred yards. To force a passage here would be impossible, so narrow was the pass itself, with the fortification walls stretching down to the sea, and precipitous rocks above; while both fortresses were furnished with gates. It was the existence of this pass which had induced Cyrus to send for the fleet, so as to enable him to lead a body of hoplites inside and outside the gates; and so to force a passage through the enemy, if he were guarding the Syrian gate, as he fully expected to find Abrocomas doing with a large army. This, however, Abrocomas had not done; but as soon as he learnt that Cyrus was in Cilicia, he had turned round and made his exit from Phoenicia, to join the king with an army amounting, as report said, to three hundred thousand men.\n\nFrom this point Cyrus pursued his march, through Syria a single stage--five parasangs--to Myriandus, a city inhabited by Phoenicians, on the sea-coast. This was a commercial port, and numerous merchant vessels were riding at anchor in the harbour. Here they halted seven days, and here Xenias the Arcadian general, and Pasion the Megarian got on board a trader, and having stowed away their most valuable effects, set sail for home; most people explained the act as the outcome of a fit of jealousy, because Cyrus had allowed Clearchus to retain their men, who had deserted to him, in hopes of returning to Hellas instead of marching against the king; when the two had so vanished, a rumour spread that Cyrus was after them with some ships of war, and some hoped the cowards might be caught, others pitied them, if that should be their fate.\n\nBut Cyrus summoned the generals and addressed them: \"Xenias and 8 Pasion,\" he said, \"have taken leave of us; but they need not flatter themselves that in so doing they have stolen into hiding. I know where they are gone; nor will they owe their escape to speed; I have men-of-war to capture their craft, if I like. But heaven help me! if I mean to pursue them: never shall it be said of me, that I turn people to account as long as they stay with me, but as soon as they are minded to be off, I seize and maltreat them, and strip them of their wealth. Not so! let them go with the consciousness that our behaviour to them is better than theirs to us. And yet I have their children and wives safe under lock and key in Tralles; but they shall not be deprived even of these. They shall receive them back in return for their former goodness to me.\" So he spoke, and the Hellenes, even those who had been out of heart at the thought of marching up the country, when they heard of the nobleness of Cyrus, were happier and more eager to follow him on his path.\n\nAfter this Cyrus marched onwards four stages--twenty parasangs--to the river Chalus. That river is a hundred feet broad, and is stocked with tame fish which the Syrians regard as gods, and will not suffer to be injured--and so too the pigeons of the place. The villages in which they encamped belonged to Parysatis, as part of her girdle money. From this point he marched on five stages--thirty parasangs--to the sources of the river Dardas, which is a hundred feet broad. Here stood the palace of Belesys, the ruler of Syria, with its park--which was a very large and beautiful one, and full of the products of all the seasons in their course. But Cyrus cut down the park and burnt the palace. Thence he marched on three stages--fifteen parasangs--to the river Euphrates, which is nearly half a mile broad. A large and 11 flourishing city, named Thapsacus, stands on its banks. Here they halted five days, and here Cyrus sent for the generals of the Hellenes, and told them that the advance was now to be upon Babylon, against the great king; he bade them communicate this information to the soldiers and persuade them to follow. The generals called an assembly, and announced the news to the soldiers. The latter were indignant and angry with the generals, accusing them of having kept secret what they had long known; and refused to go, unless such a bribe of money were given them as had been given to their predecessors, when they went up with Cyrus to the court of his father, not as now to fight a battle, but on a peaceful errand--the visit of a son to his father by invitation. The demand was reported to Cyrus by the generals, and he undertook to give each man five silver minae as soon as Babylon was reached, and their pay in full, until he had safely conveyed them back to Ionia again. In this manner the Hellenic force were persuaded--that is to say, the majority of them. Menon, indeed, before it was clear what the rest of the soldiers would do--whether, in fact they would follow Cyrus or not--collected his own troops apart and made them the following speech; \"Men,\" he said, \"if you will listen to me, there is a method by which, without risk or toil, you may win the special favour of Cyrus beyond the rest of the soldiers. You ask what it is I would have you to do? I will tell you. Cyrus at this instant is begging the Hellenes to follow him to attack the king. I say then: Cross the Euphrates at once, before it is clear what answer the rest will make; if they vote in favour of following, you will get the credit of having set the example, and Cyrus will be grateful to you. He will look upon you as being the heartiest in his cause; he will repay, as of all others he best knows how; while, if the rest vote against crossing, we shall go back again; but as the sole adherents, whose fidelity he can altogether trust, it is you whom Cyrus will turn to account, as commandants of garrisons or captains of companies. You need only ask him for whatever you want, and you will get it from him, as being the friends of Cyrus.\n\n Cf. Plat. \"Alcib.\" i. 123 B. \"Why, I have been informed by a credible person, who went up to the king (at Susa), that he passed through a large tract of excellent land, extending for nearly a day's journey, which the people of the country called the queen's girdle, and another which they called her veil,\" etc. Olympiodorus and the Scholiast both think that Plato here refers to Xenophon and this passage of the \"Anabasis.\" Grote thinks it very probable that Plato had in his mind Xenophon (either his \"Anabasis\" or personal communications with him).\n\nThe men heard and obeyed, and before the rest had given their answer, they were already across. But when Cyrus perceived that Menon's troops 16 had crossed, he was well pleased, and he sent Glus to the division in question, with this message: \"Soldiers, accept my thanks at present; eventually you shall thank me. I will see to that, or my name is not Cyrus.\" The soldiers therefore could not but pray heartily for his success; so high their hopes ran. But to Menon, it was said, he sent gifts with lordly liberality. This done, Cyrus proceeded to cross; and in his wake followed the rest of the armament to a man. As they forded, never a man was wetted above the chest: nor ever until this moment, said the men of Thapascus, had the river been so crossed on foot, boats had always been required; but these, at the present time, Abrocomas, in his desire to hinder Cyrus from crossing, had been at pains to burn. Thus the passage was looked upon as a thing miraculous; the river had manifestly retired before the face of Cyrus, like a courtier bowing to his future king. From this place he continued his march through Syria nine stages--fifty parasangs--and they reached the river Araxes. Here were several villages full of corn and wine; in which they halted three days, and provisioned the army.\n\nV\n\nThence he marched on through Arabia, keeping the Euphrates on the 1 right, five desert stages--thirty-five parasangs. In this region the ground was one long level plain, stretching far and wide like the sea, full of absinth; whilst all the other vegetation, whether wood or reed, was sweet scented like spice or sweet herb; there were no trees; but there was wild game of all kinds--wild asses in greatest abundance, with plenty of ostriches; besides these, there were bustards and antelopes. These creatures were occasionally chased by the cavalry. The asses, when pursued, would run forward a space, and then stand still--their pace being much swifter than that of horses; and as soon as the horses came close, they went through the same performance. The only way to catch them was for the riders to post themselves at intervals, and to hunt them in relays, as it were. The flesh of those they captured was not unlike venison, only more tender. No one was lucky enough to capture an ostrich. Some of the troopers did give chase, but it had soon to be abandoned; for the bird, in its effort to escape, speedily put a long interval between itself and its 3 pursuers; plying its legs at full speed, and using its wings the while like a sail. The bustards were not so hard to catch when started suddenly; for they only take short flights, like partridges, and are soon tired. Their flesh is delicious.\n\nAs the army wended its way through this region, they reached the river Mascas, which is one hundred feet in breadth. Here stood a big deserted city called Corsote, almost literally environed by the stream, which flows round it in a circle. Here they halted three days and provisioned themselves. Thence they continued their march thirteen desert stages--ninety parasangs--with the Euphrates still on their right, until they reached the Gates. On these marches several of the baggage animals perished of hunger, for there was neither grass nor green herb, or tree of any sort; but the country throughout was barren. The inhabitants make their living by quarrying millstones on the river banks, which they work up and take to Babylon and sell, purchasing corn in exchange for their goods. Corn failed the army, and was not to be got for money, except in the Lydian market open in Cyrus's Asiatic army; where a kapithe of wheat or barley cost four shekels; the shekel being equal to seven and a half Attic obols, whilst the kapithe is the equivalent of two Attic choeneces, dry measure, so that the soldiers subsisted on meat alone for the whole period. Some of the stages were very long, whenever they had to push on to find water or fodder; and once they found themselves involved in a narrow way, where the deep clay presented an obstacle to the progress of the wagons. Cyrus, with the nobles about him, halted to superintend the operation, and ordered Glus and Pigres to take a body of barbarians and to help in extricating the wagons. As they seemed to be slow about the business, he turned round angrily to the Persian nobles and bade them lend a hand to force the wagons out. Then, if ever, what goes to constitute one branch of good discipline, was to be witnessed. Each of those addressed, just where he chanced to be 8 standing, threw off his purple cloak, and flung himself into the work with as much eagerness as if it had been a charge for victory. Down a steep hill side they flew, with their costly tunics and embroidered trousers--some with the circlets round their necks, and bracelets on their arms--in an instant, they had sprung into the miry clay, and in less time than one could have conceived, they had landed the wagons safe on terra firma.\n\n The choenix = about 1 quart (or, according to others, 1 1/2 pint). It was the minimum allowance of corn for a man, say a slave, per diem. The Spartan was allowed at the public table 2 choenices a day.\n\nAltogether it was plain that Cyrus was bent on pressing on the march, and averse to stoppages, except where he halted for the sake of provisioning or some other necessary object; being convinced that the more rapidly he advanced, the less prepared for battle would he find the king; while the slower his own progress, the larger would be the hostile army which he would find collected. Indeed, the attentive observer could see, at a glance, that if the king's empire was strong in its extent of territory and the number of inhabitants, that strength is compensated by an inherent weakness, dependent upon the length of roads and the inevitable dispersion of defensive forces, where an invader insists upon pressing home the war by forced marches.\n\nOn the opposite side of the Euphrates to the point reached on one of these desert stages, was a large and flourishing city named Charmande. From this town the soldiers made purchases of provisions, crossing the river on rafts, in the following fashion: They took the skins which they used as tent coverings, and filled them with light grass; they then compressed and stitched them tightly together by the ends, so that the water might not touch the hay. On these they crossed and got provisions: wine made from the date-nut, and millet or panic-corn, the common staple of the country. Some dispute or other here occurred between the soldiers of Menon and Clearchus, in which Clearchus sentenced one of Menon's men, as the delinquent, and had him flogged. The man went back to his own division and told them. Hearing what had been done to their comrade, his fellows fretted and fumed, and were highly incensed against Clearchus. The same day Clearchus visited the passage of the river, and after inspecting the market there, was returning with a few followers, on horseback, to his tent, and had to 12 pass through Menon's quarters. Cyrus had not yet come up, but was riding up in the same direction. One of Menon's men, who was splitting wood, caught sight of Clearchus as he rode past, and aimed a blow at him with his axe. The aim took no effect; when another hurled a stone at him, and a third, and then several, with shouts and hisses. Clearchus made a rapid retreat to his own troops, and at once ordered them to get under arms. He bade his hoplites remain in position with their shields resting against their knees, while he, at the head of his Thracians and horsemen, of which he had more than forty in his army--Thracians for the most part--advanced against Menon's soldiers, so that the latter, with Menon himself, were panic-stricken, and ran to seize their arms; some even stood riveted to the spot, in perplexity at the occurrence. Just then Proxenus came up from behind, as chance would have it, with his division of hoplites, and without a moment's hesitation marched into the open space between the rival parties, and grounded arms; then he fell to begging Clearchus to desist. The latter was not too well pleased to hear his trouble mildly spoken of, when he had barely escaped being stoned to death; and he bade Proxenus retire and leave the intervening space open. At this juncture Cyrus arrived and inquired what was happening. There was no time for hesitation. With his javelins firmly grasped in his hands he galloped up--escorted by some of his faithful bodyguard, who were present--and was soon in the midst, exclaiming: \"Clearchus, Proxenus, and you other Hellenes yonder, you know not what you do. As surely as you come to blows with one another, our fate is sealed--this very day I shall be cut to pieces, and so will you: your turn will follow close on mine. Let our fortunes once take an evil turn, and these barbarians whom you see around will be worse foes to us than those who are at present serving the king.\" At these words Clearchus came to his senses. Both parties paused from battle, and retired to their quarters: order reigned.\n\nVI\n\nAs they advanced from this point (opposite Charmande), they came upon 1 the hoof-prints and dung of horses at frequent intervals. It looked like the trail of some two thousand horses. Keeping ahead of the army, these fellows burnt up the grass and everything else that was good for use. Now there was a Persian, named Orontas; he was closely related to the king by birth: and in matters pertaining to war reckoned among the best of Persian warriors. Having formerly been at war with Cyrus, and afterwards reconciled to him, he now made a conspiracy to destroy him. he made a proposal to Cyrus: if Cyrus would furnish him with a thousand horsemen, he would deal with these troopers, who were burning down everything in front of them; he would lay an ambuscade and cut them down, or he would capture a host of them alive; in any case, he would put a stop to their agressiveness and burnings; he would see to it that they did not ever get a chance of setting eyes on Cyrus's army and reporting its advent to the king. The proposal seemed plausible to Cyrus, who accordingly authorised Orontas to take a detachment from each of the generals, and be gone. He, thinking that he had got his horsemen ready to his hand, wrote a letter to the king, announcing that he would ere long join him with as many troopers as he could bring; he bade him, at the same time, instruct the royal cavalry to welcome him as a friend. The letter further contained certain reminders of his former friendship and fidelity. This despatch he delivered into the hands of one who was a trusty messenger, as he thought; but the bearer took and gave it to Cyrus. Cyrus read it. Orontas was arrested. Then Cyrus summoned to his tent seven of the noblest Persians among his personal attendants, and sent orders to the Hellenic generals to bring up a body of hoplites. These troops were to take up a position round his tent. This the generals did; bringing up about three thousand hoplites. Clearchus was also invited inside, to assist at the court-martial; a compliment due to the position he held among the other generals, in the opinion not only of Cyrus, but also of the rest of the court. When he came out, he reported the circumstances of the trial (as to which, indeed, there was no mystery) to his friends. He said that Cyrus opened the inquiry with these words: \"I have invited you hither, my friends, that I may take advice with you, and carry out whatever, in the sight of God and man, it is right for me to do, as concerning the man before you, Orontas. The 6 prisoner was, in the first instance, given to me by my father, to be my faithful subject. In the next place, acting, to use his own words, under the orders of my brother, and having hold of the acropolis of Sardis, he went to war with me. I met war with war, and forced him to think it more prudent to desist from war with me: whereupon we shook hands, exchanging solemn pledges. After that,\" and at this point Cyrus turned to Orontas, and addressed him personally--\"after that, did I do you any wrong?\" Answer, \"Never.\" Again another question: \"Then later on, having received, as you admit, no injury from me, did you revolt to the Mysians and injure my territory, as far as in you lay?\"--\"I did,\" was the reply. \"Then, once more having discovered the limits of your power, did you flee to the altar of Artemis, crying out that you repented? and did you thus work upon my feelings, that we a second time shook hands and made interchange of solemn pledges? Are these things so?\" Orontas again assented. \"Then what injury have you received from me,\" Cyrus asked, \"that now for the third time, you have been detected in a treasonous plot against me?\"--\"I must needs do so,\" he answered. Then Cyrus put one more question: \"But the day may come, may it not, when you will once again be hostile to my brother, and a faithful friend to myself?\" The other answered: \"Even if I were, you could never be brought to believe it, Cyrus.\"\n\nAt this point Cyrus turned to those who were present and said: \"Such has been the conduct of the prisoner in the past: such is his language now. I now call upon you, and you first, Clearchus, to declare your opinion--what think you?\" And Clearchus answered: \"My advice to you is to put this man out of the way as soon as may be, so that we may be saved the necessity of watching him, and have more leisure, as far as he is concerned, to requite the services of those whose friendship is sincere.\"--\"To this opinion,\" he told us, \"the rest of the court adhered.\" After that, at the bidding of Cyrus, each of those present, 10 in turn, including the kinsmen of Orontas, took him by the girdle; which is as much as to say, \"Let him die the death,\" and then those appointed led him out; and they who in old days were wont to do obeisance to him, could not refrain, even at that moment, from bowing down before him, albeit they knew he was being led forth to death.\n\nAfter they had conducted him to the tent of Artapates, the trustiest of Cyrus's wand-bearers, none set eyes upon him ever again, alive or dead. No one, of his own knowledge, could declare the manner of his death; though some conjectured one thing and some another. No tomb to mark his resting-place, either then or since, was ever seen.\n\nVII\n\nFrom this place Cyrus marched through Babylonia three stages--twelve 1 parasangs. Now, on the third stage, about midnight, Cyrus held a review of the Hellenes and Asiatics in the plain, expecting that the king would arrive the following day with his army to offer battle. He gave orders to Clearchus to take command of the right wing, and to Menon the Thessalian of the left, while he himself undertook to the disposition of his own forces in person. After the review, with the first approach of day, deserters from the great king arrived, bringing Cyrus information about the royal army. Then Cyrus summoned the generals and captains of the Hellenes, and held a council of war to arrange the plan of battle. He took this opportunity also to address the following words of compliment and encouragement to the meeting: \"Men of Hellas,\" he said, \"it is certainly not from dearth of barbarians to fight my battles that I put myself at your head as my allies; but because I hold you to be better and stronger than many barbarians. That is why I took you. See then that you prove yourselves to be men worthy of the liberty which you possess, and which I envy you. Liberty--it is a thing which, be well assured, I would choose in preference to all my other possessions, multiplied many times. But I would like you to know into what sort of struggle you are going: learn its nature from one who knows. Their numbers are great, and they come on with much noise; but if you can hold out against these two things, I confess I am ashamed to think, what a sorry set of folk you will 4 find the inhabitants of this land to be. But you are men, and brave you must be, being men: it is agreed; then if you wish to return home, any of you, I undertake to send you back, in such sort that your friends at home shall envy you; but I flatter myself I shall persuade many of you to accept what I will offer you here, in lieu of what you left at home.\"\n\nHere Gaulites, a Samian exile, and a trusty friend of Cyrus, being present, exclaimed: \"Ay, Cyrus, but some say you can afford to make large promises now, because you are in the crisis of impending danger; but let matters go well with you, will you recollect? They shake their heads. Indeed, some add that, even if you did recollect, and were ever so willing, you would not be able to make good all your promises, and repay.\" When Cyrus heard that, he answered: \"You forget, sirs, my father's empire stretches southwards to a region where men cannot dwell by reason of the heat, and northwards to a region uninhabitable through cold; but all the intervening space is mapped out in satrapies belonging to my brother's friends: so that if the victory be ours, it will be ours also to put our friends in possession in their room. On the whole my fear is, not that I may not have enough to give to each of my friends, but lest I may not have friends enough on whom to bestow what I have to give, and to each of you Hellenes I will give a crown of gold.\"\n\nSo they, when they heard these words, were once more elated than ever themselves, and spread the good news among the rest outside. And there came into his presence both the generals and some of the other Hellenes also, claiming to know what they should have in the event of victory; and Cyrus satisfied the expectations of each and all, and so dismissed them. Now the advice and admonition of all who came into conversation with him was, not to enter the battle himself, but to post himself in rear of themselves; and at this season Clearchus put a question to him: \"But do you think that your brother will give battle 9 to you, Cyrus?\" and Cyrus answered: \"Not without a battle, be assured, shall the prize be won; if he be the son of Darius and Parysatis, and a brother of mine.\"\n\nIn the final arming for battle at this juncture, the numbers were as follows: Of Hellenes there were ten thousand four hundred heavy infantry with two thousand five hundred targeteers, while the barbarians with Cyrus reached a total of one hundred thousand. He had too about twenty scythe-chariots. The enemy's forces were reported to number one million two hundred thousand, with two hundred scythe-chariots, besides which he had six thousand cavalry under Artagerses. These formed the immediate vanguard of the king himself. The royal army was marshalled by four generals or field-marshals, each in command of three hundred thousand men. Their names were Abrocomas, Tissaphernes, Gobryas, and Arbaces. (But of this total not more than nine hundred thousand were engaged in the battle, with one hundred and fifty scythe-chariots; since Abrocomas, on his march from Phoenicia, arrived five days too late for the battle.) Such was the information brought to Cyrus by deserters who came in from the king's army before the battle, and it was corroborated after the battle by those of the enemy who were taken prisoners.\n\nFrom this place Cyrus advanced one stage--three parasangs--with the whole body of his troops, Hellenic and barbarian alike in order of battle. He expected the king to give battle the same day, for in the middle of this day's march a deep sunk trench was reached, thirty feet broad, and eighteen feet deep. The trench was carried inland through the plain, twelve parasang's distance, to the wall of Media. \n\n For \"the wall of Media\" see Grote, \"Hist. of Greece,\" vol. ix. p. 87 and foll. note 1 (1st ed.), and various authorities there quoted or referred to. The next passage enclosed in  may possibly be a commentator's or editor's note, but, on the whole, I have thought it best to keep the words in the text instead of relegating them, as heretofore, to a note. Perhaps some future traveller may clear up all difficulties.\n\nBetween the Euphrates and the trench was a narrow passage, twenty feet only in breadth. The trench itself had been constructed by the great king upon hearing of Cyrus's approach, to serve as a line of defence. Through this narrow passage then Cyrus and his army passed, and found themselves safe inside the trench. So there was no battle to be fought with the king that day; only there were numerous unmistakable traces of horse and infantry in retreat. Here Cyrus summoned Silanus, his Ambraciot soothsayer, and presented him with three thousand darics; because eleven days back, when sacrificing, he had told him that the king would not fight within ten days, and Cyrus had answered: \"Well, then, if he does not fight within that time, he will not fight at all; and if your prophecy comes true, I promise you ten talents.\" So now, that the ten days were passed, he presented him with the above sum.\n\nBut as the king had failed to hinder the passage of Cyrus's army at the trench, Cyrus himself and the rest concluded that he must have abandoned the idea of offering battle, so that next day Cyrus advanced with less than his former caution. On the third day he was conducting the march, seated in his carriage, with only a small body of troops drawn up in front of him. The mass of the army was moving on in no kind of order: the soldiers having consigned their heavy arms to be carried in the wagons or on the backs of beasts.\n\nVIII\n\nIt was already about full market time and the halting-place at 1 which the army was to take up quarters was nearly reached, when Pategyas, a Persian, a trusty member of Cyrus's personal staff, came galloping up at full speed on his horse, which was bathed in sweat, and to every one he met he shouted in Greek and Persian, as fast as he could ejaculate the words: \"The king is advancing with a large army ready for battle.\" Then ensued a scene of wild confusion. The Hellenes and all alike were expecting to be attacked on the instant, and before they could form their lines. Cyrus sprang from his carriage and donned his corselet; then leaping on to his charger's back, with the javelins firmly clutched, he passed the order to the rest, to arm themselves and fall into their several ranks.\n\n I.e. between 9 and 10 A.M.\n\nThe orders were carried out with alacrity; the ranks shaped themselves. Clearchus held the right wing resting on the Euphrates, Proxenus was next, and after him the rest, while Menon with his troops held the Hellenic left. Of the Asiatics, a body of Paphlagonian cavalry, one thousand strong, were posted beside Clearchus on the right, and with them stood the Hellenic peltasts. On the left was Ariaeus, Cyrus's second in command, and the rest of the barbarian host. Cyrus was with his bodyguard of cavalry about six hundred strong, all armed with corselets like Cyrus, and cuirasses and helmets; but not so Cyrus: he went into battle with head unhelmeted. So too all the horses with Cyrus wore forehead-pieces and breast-pieces, and the troopers carried short Hellenic swords.\n\n The MSS. add, \"to expose oneself to the risks of war bareheaded is, it is said, a practice common to the Persians,\" which I regard as a commentator's note, if not an original marginal note of some early editor, possibly of the author himself. The \"Cyropaedeia\" is full of such comments, \"pieces justificatives\" inserted into the text.\n\nIt was now mid-day, and the enemy was not yet in sight; but with the approach of afternoon was seen dust like a white cloud, and after a considerable interval a black pall as it were spread far and high above the plain. As they came nearer, very soon was seen here and there a glint of bronze and spear-points; and the ranks could plainly be distinguished. On the left were troopers wearing white cuirasses. That is Tissaphernes in command, they said, and next to these a body of men bearing wicker-shields, and next again heavy-armed infantry, with long wooden shields reaching to the feet. These were the Egyptians, they said, and then other cavalry, other bowmen; all were in national divisions, each nation marching in densely-crowded 10 squares. And all along their front was a line of chariots at considerable intervals from one another--the famous scythe-chariots, as they were named--having their scythes fitted to the axle-trees and stretching out slantwise, while others protruded under the chariot-seats, facing the ground, so as to cut through all they encountered. The design was to let them dash full speed into the ranks of the Hellenes and cut them through.\n\nCuriously enough the anticipation of Cyrus, when at the council of war he admonished the Hellenes not to mind the shouting of the Asiatics, was not justified. Instead of shouting, they came on in deep silence, softly and slowly, with even tread. At this instant, Cyrus, riding past in person, accompanied by Pigres, his interpreter, and three or four others, called aloud to Clearchus to advance against the enemy's centre, for there the king was to be found: \"And if we strike home at this point,\" he added, \"our work is finished.\" Clearchus, though he could see the compact body at the centre, and had been told by Cyrus that the king lay outside the Hellenic left (for, owing to numerical superiority, the king, while holding his own centre, could well overlap Cyrus's extreme left), still hesitated to draw off his right wing from the river, for fear of being turned on both flanks; and he simply replied, assuring Cyrus that he would take care all went well.\n\nAt this time the barbarian army was evenly advancing, and the Hellenic division was still riveted to the spot, completing its formation as the various contingents came up. Cyrus, riding past at some distance from the lines, glanced his eye first in one direction and then in the other, so as to take a complete survey of friends and foes; when Xenophon the Athenian, seeing him, rode up from the Hellenic quarter to meet him, asking him whether he had any orders to give. Cyrus, pulling up his horse, begged him to make the announcement generally known that the omens from the victims, internal and external alike, were good. While he was still speaking, he heard a confused murmur 16 passing through the ranks, and asked what it meant. The other replied that it was the watchword being passed down for the second time. Cyrus wondered who had given the order, and asked what the watchword was. On being told it was \"Zeus our Saviour and Victory,\" he replied, \"I accept it; so let it be,\" and with that remark rode away to his own position. And now the two battle lines were no more than three or four furlongs apart, when the Hellenes began chanting the paean, and at the same time advanced against the enemy.\n\n I.e. the omens from inspecting the innards of the victims, and the omens from the acts and movements of the victims.\n\nBut with the forward movement a certain portion of the line curved onwards in advance, with wave-like sinuosity, and the portion left behind quickened to a run; and simultaneously a thrilling cry burst from all lips, like that in honour of the war-god--eleleu! eleleu! and the running became general. Some say they clashed their shields and spears, thereby causing terror to the horses; and before they had got within arrowshot the barbarians swerved and took to flight. And now the Hellenes gave chase with might and main, checked only by shouts to one another not to race, but to keep their ranks. The enemy's chariots, reft of their charioteers, swept onwards, some through the enemy themselves, others past the Hellenes. They, as they saw them coming, opened a gap and let them pass. One fellow, like some dumbfoundered mortal on a racecourse, was caught by the heels, but even he, they said, received no hurt, nor indeed, with the single exception of some one on the left wing who was said to have been wounded by an arrow, did any Hellene in this battle suffer a single hurt.\n\n Some critics regard this sentence as an editor's or commentator's note.\n\nCyrus, seeing the Hellene's conquering, as far as they at any rate were concerned, and in hot pursuit, was well content; but in spite of his joy and the salutations offered him at that moment by those about 21 him, as though he were already king, he was not led away to join in the pursuit, but keeping his squadron of six hundred horsemen in cloe order, waited and watched to see what the king himself would do. The king, he knew, held the centre of the Persian army. Indeed it is the fashion for the Asiatic monarch to occupy that position during action, for this twofold reason: he holds the safest place, with his troops on either side of him, while, if he has occasion to despatch any necessary rider along the lines, his troops will receive the message in half the time. The king accordingly on this occasion held the centre of his army, but for all that, he was outside Cyrus's left wing; and seeing that no one offered him battle in front, nor yet the troops in front of him, he wheeled as if to encircle the enemy. It was then that Cyrus, in apprehension lest the king might get round to the rear and cut to pieces the Hellenic body, charged to meet him. Attacking with his six hundred, he mastered the line of troops in front of the king, and put to flight the six thousand, cutting down, as is said, with his own hand their general, Artagerses.\n\nBut as soon as the rout commenced, Cyrus's own six hundred themselves, in the ardour of pursuit, were scattered, with the exception of a handful who were left with Cyrus himself--chiefly his table companions, so-called. Left alone with these, he caught sight of the king, and the close throng about him. Unable longer to contain himself, with a cry, \"I see the man,\" he rushed at him and dealt a blow at his chest, wounding him through the corselet. This, according to the statement of Ctesias the surgeon, who further states that he himself healed the wound. As Cyrus delivered the blow, some one struck him with a javelin under the eye severely; and in the struggle which then ensued between the king and Cyrus and those about them to protect one or other, we have the statement of Ctesias as to the number slain 27 on the king's side, for he was by his side. On the other, Cyrus himself fell, and eight of his bravest companions lay on the top of him. The story says that Artapes, the trustiest among his wand-wearers, when he saw that Cyrus had fallen to the ground, leapt from his horse and threw his arms about him. Then, as one account says, the king bade one slay him as a worthy victim to his brother: others say that Artapates drew his scimitar and slew himself by his own hand. A golden scimitar it is true, he had; he wore also a collar and bracelets and the other ornaments such as the noblest Persians wear; for his kindliness and fidelity had won him honours at the hands of Cyrus.\n\n \"Ctesias, the son of Ctesiochus, was a physician of Cnidos. Seventeen years of his life were passed at the court of Persia, fourteen in the service of Darios, three in that of Artaxerxes; he returned to Greece in 398 B.C.,\" and \"was employed by Artaxerxes in diplomatic services.\" See Mure; also Ch. Muller, for his life and works. He wrote (1) a history on Persian affairs in three parts--Assyrian, Median, Persian--with a chapter \"On Tributes;\" (2) a history of Indian affairs (written in the vein of Sir John Maundeville, Kt.); (3) a Periplus; (4) a treatise on Mountains; (5) a treatise on Rivers.\n\nIX\n\nSo died Cyrus; a man the kingliest and most worthy to rule of all 1 the Persians who have lived since the elder Cyrus: according to the concurrent testimony of all who are reputed to have known him intimately. To begin from the beginning, when still a boy, and whilst being brought up with his brother and the other lads, his unrivalled excellence was recognised. For the sons of the noblest Persians, it must be known, are brought up, one and all, at the king's portals. Here lessons of sobreity and self-control may largely be laid to heart, while there is nothing base or ugly for eye or ear to feed upon. There is the daily spectacle ever before the boys of some receiving honour from the king, and again of others receiving dishonour; and the tale of all this is in their ears, so that from earliest boyhood they learn how to rule and to be ruled.\n\n The character now to be drawn is afterwards elaborated into the Cyrus of the Cyropaedeia.\n\nIn this courtly training Cyrus earned a double reputation; first he was held to be a paragon of modesty among his fellows, rendering an obedience to his elders which exceeded that of many of his own inferiors; and next he bore away the palm for skill in horsemanship and for love of the animal itself. Nor less in matters of war, in the use of the bow and the javelin, was he held by men in general to be at 5 once the aptest of learners and the most eager practiser. As soon as his age permitted, the same pre-eminence showed itself in his fondness for the chase, not without a certain appetite for perilous adventure in facing the wild beasts themselves. Once a bear made a furious rush at him, and without wincing he grappled with her, and was pulled from his horse, receiving wounds the scars of which were visible through life; but in the end he slew the creature, nor did he forget him who first came to his aid, but made him enviable in the eyes of many.\n\n The elder Cyrus, when a boy, kills not a bear but a boar.\n\nAfter he had been sent down by his father to be satrap of Lydia and Great Phrygia and Cappadocia, and had been appointed general of the forces, whose business it is to muster in the plain of the Castolus, nothing was more noticeable in his conduct than the importance which he attached to the faithful fulfilment of every treaty or compact or undertaking entered into with others. He would tell no lies to any one. Thus doubtless it was that he won the confidence alike of individuals and of the communities entrusted to his care; or in case of hostility, a treaty made with Cyrus was a guarantee sufficient to the combatant that he would suffer nothing contrary to its terms. Therefore, in the war with Tissaphernes, all the states of their own accord chose Cyrus in lieu of Tissaphernes, except only the men of Miletus, and these were only alienated through fear of him, because he refused to abandon their exiled citizens; and his deeds and words bore emphatic witness to his principle: even if they were weakened in number or in fortune, he would never abandon those who had once become his friends.\n\nHe made no secret of his endeavour to outdo his friends and his foes alike in reciprocity of conduct. The prayer has been attributed to him, \"God grant I may live along enough to recompense my friends and requite my foes with a strong arm.\" However this may be, no one, at least in our days, ever drew together so ardent a following of friends, eager to lay at his feet their money, their cities, their own lives and persons; nor is it to be inferred from this that he suffered the malefactor and the wrongdoer to laugh him to scorn; on the 13 contrary, these he punished most unflinchingly. It was no rare sight to see on the well-trodden highways, men who had forfeited hand or foot or eye; the result being that throughout the satrapy of Cyrus any one, Hellene or barbarian, provided he were innocent, might fearlessly travel wherever he pleased, and take with him whatever he felt disposed. However, as all allowed, it was for the brave in war that he reserved especial honour. To take the first instance to hand, he had a war with the Pisidians and Mysians. Being himself at the head of an expedition into those territories, he could observe those who voluntarily encountered risks; these he made rulers of the territory which he subjected, and afterwards honoured them with other gifts. So that, if the good and brave were set on a pinnacle of fortune, cowards were recognised as their natural slaves; and so it befell that Cyrus never had lack of volunteers in any service of danger, whenever it was expected that his eye would be upon them.\n\nSo again, wherever he might discover any one ready to distinguish himself in the service of uprightness, his delight was to make this man richer than those who seek for gain by unfair means. On the same principle, his own administration was in all respects uprightly conducted, and, in particular, he secured the services of an army worthy of the name. Generals, and sabulterns alike, came to him from across the seas, not merely to make money, but because they saw that loyalty to Cyrus was a more profitable investment than so many pounds a month. Let any man whatsoever render him willing service, such enthusiasm was sure to win its reward. And so Cyrus could always command the service of the best assistants, it was said, whatever the work might be.\n\nOr if he saw any skilful and just steward who furnished well the country over which he ruled, and created revenues, so far from robbing him at any time, to him who had, he delighted to give more. So that toil was a pleasure, and gains were amassed with confidence, and least of all from Cyrus would a man conceal the amount of his possessions, seeing that he showed no jealousy of wealth openly avowed, but his 19 endeavour was rather to turn to account the riches of those who kept them secret. Towards the friends he had made, whose kindliness he knew, or whose fitness as fellow-workers with himself, in aught which he might wish to carry out, he had tested, he showed himself in turn an adept in the arts of courtesy. Just in proportion as he felt the need of this friend or that to help him, so he tried to help each of them in return in whatever seemed to be their heart's desire.\n\nMany were the gifts bestowed on him, for many and diverse reasons; no one man, perhaps, ever received more; no one, certainly, was ever more ready to bestow them upon others, with an eye ever to the taste of each, so as to gratify what he saw to be the individual requirement. Many of these presents were sent to him to serve as personal adornments of the body or for battle; and as touching these he would say, \"How am I to deck myself out in all these? to my mind a man's chief ornament is the adornment of nobly-adorned friends.\" Indeed, that he should triumph over his friends in the great matters of welldoing is not surprising, seeing that he was much more powerful than they, but that he should go beyond them in minute attentions, and in an eager desire to give pleasure, seems to me, I must confess, more admirable. Frequently when he had tasted some specially excellent wine, he would send the half remaining flagon to some friend with a message to say: \"Cyrus says, this is the best wine he has tasted for a long time, that is his excuse for sending it to you. He hopes you will drink it up to-day with a choice party of friends.\" Or, perhaps, he would send the remainder of a dish of geese, half loaves of bread, and so forth, the bearer being instructed to say: \"This is Cyrus's favourite dish, he hopes you will taste it yourself.\" Or, perhaps, there was a great dearth of provender, when, through the number of his servants and his own careful forethought, he was enabled to get supplies for himsefl; at such times he would send to his friends in different parts, bidding them feed their horses on his hay, since it would not do for the horses that carried his friends to go starving. Then, on any long march or expedition, where the crowd of lookers-on 28 would be large, he would call his friends to him and entertain them with serious talk, as much as to say, \"These I delight to honour.\"\n\nSo that, for myself, and from all that I can hear, I should be disposed to say that no one, Greek or barbarian, was ever so beloved. In proof of this, I may cite the fact that, though Cyrus was the king's vassal and slave, no one ever forsook him to join his master, if I may except the attempt of Orontas, which was abortive. That man, indeed, had to learn that Cyrus was closer to the heart of him on whose fidelity he relied than he himself was. On the other hand, many a man revolted from the king to Cyrus, after they went to war with one another; nor were these nobodies, but rather persons high in the king's affection; yet for all that, they believed that their virtues would obtain a reward more adequate from Cyrus than from the king. Another great proof at once of his own worth and of his capacity rightly to discern all loyal, loving and firm friendship is afforded by an incident which belongs to the last moment of his life. He was slain, but fighting for his life beside him fell also every one of his faithful bodyguard of friends and table-companions, with the sole exception of Ariaeus, who was in command of the cavalry on the left, and he no sooner perceived the fall of Cyrus than he betook himself to flight, with the whole body of troops under his lead.\n\nX\n\nThen the head of Cyrus and his right hand were severed from the body. 1 But the king and those about him pursued and fell upon the Cyreian camp, and the troops of Ariaeus no longer stood their ground, but fled through their own camp back to the halting-place of the night before--a distance of four parasangs, it was said. So the king and those with him fell to ravaging right and left, and amongst other spoil he captured the Phocaean woman, who was a concubine of Cyrus, witty and beautiful, if fame speaks correctly. The Milesian, who was the younger, was also seized by some of the king's men; but, letting go her outer garment, she made good her escape to the Hellenes, who had been left among the camp followers on guard. These fell at once 3 into line and put to the sword many of the pillagers, though they lost some men themselves; they stuck to the place and succeeded in saving not only that lady, but all else, whether chattels or human beings, wich lay within their reach.\n\nAt this point the king and the Hellenes were something like three miles apart; the one set were pursuing their opponents just as if their conquest had been general; the others were pillaging as merrily as if their victory were already universal. But when the Hellenes learnt that the king and his troops were in the baggage camp; and the king, on his side, was informed by Tissaphernes that the Hellenes were victorious in their quarter of the field, and had gone forward in pursuit, the effect was instantaneous. The king massed his troops and formed into line. Clearchus summoned Proxenus, who was next him, and debated whether to send a detachment or to go in a body to the camp to save it.\n\nMeanwhile the king was seen again advancing, as it seemed, from the rear; and the Hellenes, turning right about, prepared to receive his attack then and there. But instead of advancing upon them at that point, he drew off, following the line by which he had passed earlier in the day, outside the left wing of his opponent, and so picked up in his passage those who had deserted to the Hellenes during the battle, as also Tissaphernes and his division. The latter had not fled in the first shock of the encounter; he had charged parallel to the line of the Euphrates into the Greek peltasts, and through them. But charge as he might, he did not lay low a single man. On the contrary, the Hellenes made a gap to let them through, hacking them with their swords and hurling their javelins as they passed. Episthenes of Amphipolis was in command of the peltasts, and he showed himself a sensible man, it was said. Thus it was that Tissaphernes, having got through haphazard, with rather the worst of it, failed to wheel round and return the way he came, but reaching the camp of the Hellenes, 8 there fell in with the king; and falling into order again, the two divisions advanced side by side.\n\nWhen they were parallel with the (original) left wing of the Hellenes, fear seized the latter lest they might take them in flank and enfold them on both sides and cut them down. In this apprehension they determined to extend their line and place the river on their rear. But while they deliberated, the king passed by and ranged his troops in line to meet them, in exactly the same position in which he had advanced to offer battle at the commencemet of the engagement. The Hellenes, now seeing them in close proximity and in battle order, once again raised the paean and began the attack with still greater enthusiasm than before: and once again the barbarians did not wait to receive them, but took to flight, even at a greater distance than before. The Hellenes pressed the pursuit until they reached a certain village, where they halted, for above the village rose a mound, on which the king and his party rallied and reformed; they had no infantry any longer, but the crest was crowded with cavalry, so that it was impossible to discover what was happening. They did see, they said, the royal standard, a kind of golden eagle, with wings extended, perched on a bar of wood and raised upon a lance.\n\nBut as soon as the Hellenes again moved onwards, the hostile cavalry at once left the hillock--not in a body any longer, but in fragments--some streaming from one side, some from another; and the crest was gradually stripped of its occupants, till at last the company was gone. Accordingly, Clearchus did not ascend the crest, but posting his army at its base, he sent Lycius of Syracuse and another to the summit, with orders to inspect the condition of things on the other side, and to report results. Lycius galloped up and investigated, bringing back news that they were fleeing might and main. Almost at that instant the sun sank beneath the horizon. There the Hellenes halted; they grounded arms and rested, marvelling the while that Cyrus was not anywhere to be seen, and that no messenger had come from him. For they were in complete ignorance of his death, and conjectured that either he had gone off in pursuit, or had pushed forward to occupy some point. Left to themselves, they now deliberated, whether they should stay where they were and have the baggage train brought up, or should return to camp. They resolved to return, and about supper time reached the tents. Such was the conclusion of this day.\n\nThey found the larger portion of their property pillaged, eatables and drinkables alike, not excepting the wagons laden with corn and wine, which Cyrus had prepared in case of some extreme need overtaking the expedition, to divide among the Hellenes. There were four hundred of these wagons, it was said, and these had now been ransacked by the king and his men; so that the greater number of the Hellenes went supperless, having already gone without their breakfasts, since the king had appeared before the usual halt for breakfast. Accordingly, in no better plight than this they passed the night.\nBOOK II\n\n\n\nI\n\nWith the break of day the generals met, and were surprised that Cyrus 1 should not have appeared himself, or at any rate have sent some one to tell them what to do. Accordingly, they resolved to put what they had together, to get under arms, and to push forward until they effected junction with Cyrus. Just as they were on the point of starting, with the rising sun came Procles the ruler of Teuthrania. He was a descendant of Damaratus the Laconian, and with him also came Glus the son of Tamos. These two told them, first, that Cyrus was dead; next, that Ariaeus had retreated with the rest of the barbarians to the halting-place whence they had started at dawn on the previous day; and wished to inform them that, if they were minded to come, he would wait for this one day, but on the morrow he should return home again to Ionia, whence he came.\n\n The Spartan king who was deposed in B.C. 491, whereupon he fled to King Darius, and settled in south-western Mysia. See Herod. vi. 50, 61-70. We shall hear more of his descendant, Procles, the ruler of Teuthrania, in the last chapter of this work.\n\nWhen they heard these tidings, the generals were sorely distressed; so 4 too were the rest of the Hellenes when they were informed of it. Then Clearchus spoke as follows: \"Would that Cyrus were yet alive! But since he is dead, take back this answer to Ariaeus, that we, at any rate, have conquered the king; and, as you yourselves may see, there is not a man left in the field to meet us. Indeed, had you not arrived, we should ere this have begun our march upon the king. Now, we can promise to Ariaeus that, if he will join us here, we will place him on the king's throne. Surely to those who conquer empire pertains.\" With these words he sent back the messengers and with them he sent Cheirisophus the Laconian, and Menon the Thessalian. That was what Menon himself wished, being, as he was, a friend and intimate of Ariaeus, and bound by mutual ties of hospitality. So these set off, and Clearchus waited for them.\n\nThe soldiers furnished themselves with food  as best they might--falling back on the baggage animals, and cutting up oxen and asses. There was no lack of firewood; they need only step forward a few paces from the line where the battle was fought, and they would find arrows to hand in abundance, which the Hellenes had forced the deserters from the king to throw away. There were arrows and wicker shields also, and the huge wooden shields of the Egyptians. There were many targets also, and empty wagons left to be carried off. Here was a store which they were not slow to make use of to cook their meat and serve their meals that day.\n\nIt was now about full market hour when heralds from the king and Tissaphernes arrived. These were barbarians with one exception. This was a certain Phalinus, a Hellene who lived at the court of Tissaphernes, and was held in high esteem. He gave himself out to be a connoisseur of tactics and the art of fighting with heavy arms. These were the men who now came up, and having summoned the generals of the Hellenes, they delivered themselves of the following message: \"The great king having won the victory and slain Cyrus, bids the Hellenes to surrender their arms; to betake themselves to the gates of the king's palace, and there obtain for themselves what terms they can.\" That was what the heralds said, and the Hellenes listened with heavy 9 hearts; but Clearchus spoke, and his words were few; \"Conquerors do not, as a rule, give up their arms\"; then turning to the others he added, \"I leave it to you, my fellow-generals, to make the best and noblest answer, that ye may, to these gentlemen. I will rejoin you presently.\" At the moment an official had summoned him to come and look at the entrails which had been taken out, for, as it chanced, he was engaged in sacrificing. As soon as he was gone, Cleanor the Arcadian, by right of seniority, answered: \"They would sooner die than give up their arms.\" Then Proxenus the Theban said: \"For my part, I marvel if the king demands our arms as our master, or for the sake of friendship merely, as presents. If as our master, why need he ask for them rather than come and take them? But if he would fain wheedle us out of them by fine speeches, he should tell us what the soldiers will receive in turn for such kindness.\" In answer to him Phalinus said: \"The king claims to have conquered, because he has put Cyrus to death; and who is there now to claim the kingdom as against himself? He further flatters himself that you also are in his power, since he holds you in the heart of his country, hemmed in by impassable rivers; and he can at any moment bring against you a multitude so vast that even if leave were given to rise and slay you could not kill them.\" After him Theopompus the Athenian spoke. \"Phalinus,\" he said, \"at this instant, as you yourself can see, we have nothing left but our arms and our valour. If we keep the former we imagine we can make use of the latter; but if we deliver up our arms we shall presently be robbed of our lives. Do not suppose then that we are going to give up to you the only good things which we possess. We prefer to keep them; and by their help we will do battle with you for the good things which are yours.\" Phalinus laughed when he heard those words, and said: 13 \"Spoken like a philosopher, my fine young man, and very pretty reasoning too; yet, let me tell you, your wits are somewhat scattered if you imagine that your valour will get the better of the king's power.\" There were one or two others, it was said, who with a touch of weakness in their tone or argument, made answer: \"They had proved good and trusty friends to Cyrus, and the king might find them no less valuable. If he liked to be friends with them, he might turn them to any use that pleased his fancy, say for a campaign against Egypt. Their arms were at his service; they would help to lay that country at his feet.\"\n\n 10 A.M.\n\n So the best MSS. Others read \"Xenophon,\" which Kruger maintains to be the true reading. He suggests that \"Theopompus\" may have crept into the text from a marginal note of a scholiast, \"Theopompus\" (the historian) \"gives the remark to Proxenus.\"\n\nJust then Clearchus returned, and wished to know what answer they had given. The words were barely out of his mouth before Phalinus interrupting, answered: \"As for your friends here, one says one thing and one another; will you please give us your opinion\"; and he replied: \"The sight of you, Phalinus, caused me much pleasure; and not only me, but all of us, I feel sure; for you are a Hellene even as we are--every one of us whom you see before you. In our present plight we would like to take you into our counsel as to what we had better do touching your proposals. I beg you then solemnly, in the sight of heaven--do you tender us such advice as you shall deem best and worthiest, and such as shall bring you honour of after time, when it will be said of you how once on a time Phalinus was sent by the great king to bid certain Hellenes yield up their arms, and when they had taken him into their counsel, he gave them such and such advice. You know that whatever advice you do give us cannot fail to be reported in Hellas.\"\n\nClearchus threw out these leading remarks in hopes that this man, who was the ambassador from the king, might himself be led to advise them not to give up their arms, in which case the Hellenes would be still more sanguine and hopeful. But, contrary to his expectation, Phalinus turned round and said: \"I say that if you have one chance, one hope in ten thousand to wage a war with the king successfully, do not give up your arms. That is my advice. If, however, you have no chance of escape without the king's consent, then I say save yourselves in the only way you can.\" And Clearchus answered: \"So, then, that is your 20 deliberate view? Well, this is our answer, take it back. We conceive that in either case, whether we are expected to be friends with the king, we shall be worth more as friends if we keep our arms than if we yield them to another; or whether we are to go to war, we shall fight better with them than without.\" And Phalinus said: \"That answer we will repeat; but the king bade me tell you this besides, 'Whilst you remain here there is truce; but one step forward or one step back, the truce ends; there is war.' Will you then please inform us as to that point also? Are you minded to stop and keep truce, or is there to be war? What answer shall I take from you?\" And Clearchus replied: \"Pray answer that we hold precisely the same views on this point as the king.\"--\"How say you the same views?\" asked Phalinus. Clearchus made answer: \"As long as we stay here there is truce, but a step forward or a step backward, the truce ends; there is war.\" The other again asked: \"Peace or war, what answer shall I make?\" Clearchus returned answer once again in the same words: \"Truce if we stop, but if we move forwards or backwards war.\" But what he was minded really to do, that he refused to make further manifest.\n\nII\n\nPhalinus and those that were with him turned and went. But the 1 messengers from Ariaeus, Procles and Cheirisophus came back. As to Menon, he stayed behind with Ariaeus, They brought back this answer from Ariaeus: \"'There are many Persians,' he says, 'better than himself who will not suffer him to sit upon the king's throne; but if you are minded to go back with him, you must join him this very night, otherwise he will set off himself to-morrow on the homeward route.'\" And Clearchus said: \"It had best stand thus between us then. If we come, well and good, be it as you propose; but if we do not come, do whatsoever you think most conducive to your interests.\" And so he kept these also in the dark as to his real intention.\n\nAfter this, when the sun was already sinking, he summoned the generals and officers, and made the following statement: \"Sirs, I sacrificed and found the victims unfavourable to an advance against the king. After all, it is not so surprising perhaps, for, as I now learn, between us and the king flows the river Tigris, navigable for big 3 vessels, and we could not possibly cross it without boats, and boats we have none. On the other hand, to stop here is out of the question, for there is no possibility of getting provisions. However, the victims were quite agreeable to us joining the friends of Cyrus. This is what we must do then. Let each go away and sup on whatever he has. At the first sound of the bugle to turn in, get kit and baggage together; at the second signal, place them on the baggage animals; and at the third, fall in and follow the lead, with the baggage animals on the inside protected by the river, and the troops outside.\" After hearing the orders, the generals and officers retired, and did as they were bid; and for the future Clearchus led, and the rest followed in obedience to his orders, not that they had expressly chosen him, but they saw that he alone had the sense and wisdom requisite in a general, while the rest were inexperienced.\n\n The MSS. add the words, \"The total distance of the route, taking Ephesus in Ionia as the starting point up to the field of battle, consisted of 93 stages, 535 parasangs, or 16,050 furlongs; from the battle-field to Babylon (reckoned a three days' journey) would have been another 360 stades,\" which may well be an editor's or commentator's marginal note.\n\nHere, under cover of the darkness which descended, the Thracian Miltocythes, with forty horsemen and three hundred Thracian infantry, deserted to the king; but the rest of the troops--Clearchus leading and the rest following in accordance with the orders promulgated--took their departure, and about midnight reached their first stage, having come up with Ariaeus and his army. They grounded arms just as they stood in rank, and the generals and officers of the Hellenes met in the tent of Ariaeus. There they exchanged oaths--the Hellenes on the one side and Ariaeus with his principal officers on the other--not to betray one another, but to be true to each other as allies. The Asiatics further solemnly pledged themselves by oath to lead the way without treachery. The oaths were ratified by the sacrifice of a bull, a wolf, a boar, and a ram over a shield. The Hellenes dipped a sword, the barbarians a lance, into the blood of the victims.\n\n It is a question whether the words \"a wolf\" ought not to be omitted.\n\nAs soon as the pledge was taken, Clearchus spoke: \"And now, Ariaeus,\" he said, \"since you and we have one expedition in prospect, will you 10 tell us what you think about the route; shall we return the way we came, or have you devised a better?\" He answered: \"To return the same way is to perish to a man by hunger; for at this moment we have no provisions whatsoever. During the seventeen last stages, even on our way hither, we could extract nothing from the country; or, if there was now and again anything, we passed over and utterly consumed it. At this time our project is to take another and a longer journey certainly, but we shall not be in straits for provisions. The earliest stages must be very long, as long as we can make them; the object is to put as large a space as possible between us and the royal army; once we are two or three days' journey off, the danger is over. The king will never overtake us. With a small army he will not dare to dog our heels, and with a vast equipment he will lack the power to march quickly. Perhaps he, too, may even find a scarcity of provisions. There,\" said he, \"you asked for my opinion, see, I have given it.\"\n\nHere was a plan of the campaign, which was equivalent to a stampede: helter-skelter they were to run away, or get into hiding somehow; but fortune proved a better general. For as soon as it was day they recommenced the journey, keeping the sun on their right, and calculating that with the westering rays they would have reached villages in the territory of Babylonia, and in this hope they were not deceived. While it was yet afternoon, they thought they caught sight of some of the enemy's cavalry; and those of the Hellenes who were not in rank ran to their ranks; and Ariaeus, who was riding in a wagon to nurse a wound, got down and donned his cuirass, the rest of his party following his example. Whilst they were arming themselves, the scouts, who had been sent forward, came back with the information that they were not cavalry but baggage animals grazing. It was at once clear to all that they must be somewhere in the neighbourhood of the king's encampment. Smoke could actually be seen rising, evidently from villages not far ahead. Clearchus hesitated to advance upon the enemy, knowing that the troops were tired and hungry; and indeed it was already late. On the other hand he had no mind either to swerve from his route--guarding against any appearance of flight. Accordingly he 16 marched straight as an arrow, and with sunset entered the nearest villages with his vanguard and took up quarters.\n\nThese villages had been thoroughly sacked and dismantled by the royal army--down to the very woodwork and furniture of the houses. Still, the vanguard contrived to take up their quarters in some sort of fashion; but the rear division, coming up in the dark, had to bivouac as best they could, one detachment after another; and a great noise they made, with hue and cry to one another, so that the enemy could hear them; and those in their immediate proximity actually took to their heels, left their quarters, and decamped, as was plain enough next morning, when not a beast was to be seen, nor sign of camp or wreath of smoke anywhere in the neighbourhood. The king, as it would appear, was himself quite taken aback by the advent of the army; as he fully showed by his proceedings next day.\n\nDuring the progress of this night the Hellenes had their turn of scare--a panic seized them, and there was a noise and clatter, hardly to be explained except by the visitation of some sudden terror. But Clearchus had with him the Eleian Tolmides, the best herald of his time; him he ordered to proclaim silence, and then to give out this proclamation of the generals: \"Whoever will give any information as to who let an ass into the camp shall receive a talent of silver in reward.\" On hearing this proclamation the soldiers made up their minds that their fear was baseless, and their generals safe and sound. At break of day Clearchus gave the order to the Hellenes to get under arms in line of battle, and take up exactly the same position as they held on the day of the battle.\n\nIII\n\nAnd now comes the proof of what I stated above--that the king was 1 utterly taken aback by the sudden apparition of the army; only the day before, he had sent and demanded the surrender of their arms--and now, with the rising sun, came heralds sent by him to arrange a truce. These, having reached the advanced guard, asked for the generals. The guard reported their arrival; and Clearchus, who was busy inspecting the ranks, sent back word to the heralds that they must await his leisure. Having carefully arranged the troops so that from every side they might present the appearance of a compact battle line without a 3 single unarmed man in sight, he summoned the ambassadors, and himself went forward to meet them with the soldiers, who for choice accoutrement and noble aspect were the flower of his force; a course which he had invited the other generals also to adopt.\n\nAnd now, being face to face with the ambassadors, he questioned them as to what their wishes were. They replied that they had come to arrange a truce, and were persons competent to carry proposals from the king to the Hellenes and from the Hellenes to the king. He returned answer to them: \"Take back word then to your master, that we need a battle first, for we have had no breakfast; and he will be a brave man who will dare mention the word 'truce' to Hellenes without providing them with breakfast.\" With this message the heralds rode off, but were back again in no time, which was a proof that the king, or some one appointed by him to transact the business, was hard by. They reported that \"the message seemed reasonable to the king; they had now come bringing guides who, if a truce were arranged, would conduct them where they would get provisions.\" Clearchus inquired \"whether the truce was offered to the individual men merely as they went and came, or to all alike.\" \"To all,\" they replied, \"until the king receives your final answer.\" When they had so spoken, Clearchus, having removed the ambassadors, held a council; and it was resolved to make a truce at once, and then quietly to go and secure provisions; and Clearchus said: \"I agree to the resolution; still I do not propose to announce it at once, but to wile away time till the ambassadors begin to fear that we have decided against the truce; though I suspect,\" he added, \"the same fear will be operative on the minds of our soldiers also.\" As soon as the right moment seemed to have arrived, he delivered his answer in favour of the truce, and bade the ambassadors at once conduct them to the provisions.\n\nSo these led the way; and Clearchus, without relaxing precaution, in spite of having secured a truce, marched after them with his army in line and himself in command of the rearguard. Over and over again they encountered trenches and conduits so full of water that they could not 10 be crossed without bridges; but they contrived well enough for these by means of trunks of palm trees which had fallen, or which they cut down for the occasion. And here Clearchus's system of superintendence was a study in itself; as he stood with a spear in his left hand and a stick in the other; and when it seemed to him there was any dawdling among the parties told off to the work, he would pick out the right man and down would come the stick; nor, at the same time, was he above plunging into the mud and lending a hand himself, so that every one else was forced for very shame to display equal alacrity. The men told off for the business were the men of thirty years of age; but even the elder men, when they saw the energy of Clearchus, could not resist lending their aid also. What stimulated the haste of Clearchus was the suspicion in his mind that these trenches were not, as a rule, so full of water, since it was not the season to irrigate the plain; and he fancied that the king had let the water on for the express purpose of vividly presenting to the Hellenes the many dangers with which their march was threatened at the very start.\n\nProceeding on their way they reached some villages, where their guides indicated to them that they would find provisions. They were found to contain plenty of corn, and wine made from palm dates, and an acidulated beverage extracted by boiling from the same fruit. As to the palm nuts or dates themselves, it was noticeable that the sort which we are accustomed to see in Hellas were set aside for the domestic servants; those put aside for the masters are picked specimens, and are simply marvellous for their beauty and size, looking like great golden lumps of amber; some specimens they dried and preserved as sweetmeats. Sweet enough they were as an accompaniment of wine, but apt to give headache. Here, too, for the first time in their lives, the men tasted the brain of the palm. No one could help being struck by the beauty of this object, and the peculiarity of its delicious flavour; but this, like the dried fruits, was exceedingly apt to give headache. When this cabbage or brain has been removed from the palm the whole tree withers from top to bottom.\n\n I.e. the cabbage-like crown.\n\nIn these villages they remained three days, and a deputation from the 17 great king arrived--Tissaphernes and the king's brother-in-law and three other Persians--with a retinue of many slaves. As soon as the generals of the Hellenes had presented themselves, Tissaphernes opened the proceedings with the following speech, through the lips of an interpreter: \"Men of Hellas, I am your next-door neighbour in Hellas. Therefore was it that I, when I saw into what a sea of troubles you were fallen, regarded it as a godsend, if by any means I might obtain, as a boon from the king, the privilege of bringing you back in safety to your own country: and that, I take it, will earn me gratitude from you and all Hellas. In this determination I preferred my request to the king; I claimed it as a favour which was fairly my due; for was it not I who first announced to him the hostile approach of Cyrus? who supported that announcement by the aid I brought; who alone among the officers confronted with the Hellenes in battle did not flee, but charged right through and united my troops with the king inside your camp, where he was arrived, having slain Cyrus; it was I, lastly, who gave chase to the barbarians under Cyrus, with the help of those here present with me at this moment, which are also among the trustiest followers of our lord the king. Now, I counsel you to give a moderate answer, so that it may be easier for me to carry out my design, if haply I may obtain from him some good thing on your behalf.\"\n\nThereupon the Hellenes retired and took counsel. Then they answered, and Clearchus was their spokesman: \"We neither mustered as a body to make war against the king, nor was our march conducted with that object. But it was Cyrus, as you know, who invented many and divers pretexts, that he might take you off your guard, and transport us hither. Yet, after a while, when we saw that he was in sore straits, we were ashamed in the sight of God and man to betray him, whom we had permitted for so long a season to benefit us. But now that Cyrus is dead, we set up no claim to his kingdom against the king himself; there is neither person nor thing for the sake of which we would care 23 to injure the king's country; we would not choose to kill him if we could, rather we would march straight home, if we were not molested; but, God helping us, we will retaliate on all who injure us. On the other hand, if any be found to benefit us, we do not mean to be outdone in kindly deeds, as far as in us lies.\"\n\nSo he spoke, and Tissaphernes listened and replied: \"That answer will I take back to the king and bring you word from him again. Until I come again, let the truce continue, and we will furnish you with a market.\" All next day he did not come back, and the Hellenes were troubled with anxieties, but on the third day he arrived with the news that he had obtained from the king the boon he asked; he was permitted to save the Hellenes, though there were many gainsayers who argued that it was not seemly for the king to let those who had marched against him depart in peace. And at last he said: \"You may now, if you like, take pledges from us, that we will make the countries through which you pass friendly to you, and will lead you back without treachery into Hellas, and will furnish you with a market; and wherever you cannot purchase, we will permit you to take provisions from the district. You, on your side, must swear that you will march as through a friendly country, without damage--merely taking food and drink wherever we fail to supply a market--or, if we afford a market, you shall only obtain provisions by paying for them.\" This was agreed to, and oaths and pledges exchanged between them--Tissaphernes and the king's brother-in-law upon the one side, and the generals and officers of the Hellenes on the other. After this Tissaphernes said: \"And now I go back to the king; as soon as I have transacted what I have a mind to, I will come back, ready equipped, to lead you away to Hellas, and to return myself to my own dominion.\"\n\nIV\n\nAfter these things the Hellenes and Ariaeus waited for Tissaphernes, 1 being encamped close to one another: for more than twenty days they waited, during which time there came visitors to Ariaeus, his brother and other kinsfolk. To those under him came certain other Persians, encouraging them and bearing pledges to some of them from the king himself--that he would bear no grudge against them on account of the part they bore in the expedition against him with Cyrus, or for aught else of the things which were past. Whilst these overtures were being made, Ariaeus and his friends gave manifest signs of paying less attention to the Hellenes, so much so that, if for no other reason, the majority of the latter were not well pleased, and they came to Clearchus and the other generals, asking what they were waiting for. \"Do we not know full well,\" they said, \"that the king would give a great deal to destroy us, so that other Hellenes may take warning and think twice before they march against the king. To-day it suits his purpose to induce us to stop here, because his army is scattered; but as soon as he has got together another armament, attack us most certainly he will. How do we know he is not at this moment digging away at trenches, or running up walls, to make our path impassable. It is not to be supposed that he will desire us to return to Hellas with a tale how a handful of men like ourselves beat the king at his own gates, laughed him to scorn, and then came home again.\" Clearchus replied: \"I too am keenly aware of all this; but I reason thus: if we turn our backs now, they will say, we mean war and are acting contrary to the truce, and then what follows? First of all, no one will furnish us with a market or means of providing ourselves with food. Next, we shall have no one to guide us; moreover, such action on our part will be a signal to Ariaeus to hold aloof from us, so that not a friend will be left to us; even those who were formerly our friends will now be numbered with our enemies. What other river, or rivers, we may find we have to cross, I do not know; but this we know, to cross the Euphrates in face of resistance is impossible. You see, in the event of being driven to an engagement, we have no cavalry to help us, but with the enemy it is the reverse--not only the most, but the best of his troops are cavalry, so that if we are victorious, we shall kill no one, but if we are defeated, not a man of us can escape. For my part, I cannot see why the king, who has so many advantages on his side, if 7 he desires to destroy us, should swear oaths and tender solemn pledges merely in order to perjure himself in the sight of heaven, to render his word worthless and his credit discreditable the wide world over.\" These arguments he propounded at length.\n\nMeanwhile Tissaphernes came back, apparently ready to return home; he had his own force with him, and so had Orontas, who was also present, his. The latter brought, moreover, his bride with him, the king's daughter, whom he had just wedded. The journey was now at length fairly commenced. Tissaphernes led the way, and provided a market. They advanced, and Ariaeus advanced too, at the head of Cyrus's Asiatic troops, side by side with Tissaphernes and Orontas, and with these two he also pitched his camp. The Hellenes, holding them in suspicion, marched separately with the guides, and they encamped on each occasion a parasang apart, or rather less; and both parties kept watch upon each other as if they were enemies, which hardly tended to lull suspicion; and sometimes, whilst foraging for wood and grass and so forth on the same ground, blows were exchanged, which occasioned further embitterments. Three stages they had accomplished ere they reached the wall of Media, as it is called, and passed within it. It was built of baked bricks laid upon bitumen. It was twenty feet broad and a hundred feet high, and the length of it was said to be twenty parasangs. It lies at no great distance from Babylon.\n\nFrom this point they marched two stages--eight parasangs--and crossed two canals, the first by a regular bridge, the other spanned by a bridge of seven boats. These canals issued from the Tigris, and from them a whole system of minor trenches was cut, leading over the country, large ones to begin with, and then smaller and smaller, till at last they become the merest runnels, like those in Hellas used for watering millet fields. They reached the river Tigris. At this point there was a large and thickly populated city named Sittace, at a 13 distance of fifteen furlongs from the river. The Hellenes accordingly encamped by the side of that city, near a large and beautiful park, which was thick with all sorts of trees.\n\nThe Asiatics had crossed the Tigris, but somehow were entirely hidden from view. After supper, Proxenus and Xenophon were walking in front of the place d'armes, when a man came up and demanded of the advanced guard where he could find Proxenus or Clearchus. He did not ask for Menon, and that too though he came from Ariaeus, who was Menon's friend. As soon as Proxenus had said: \"I am he, whom you seek,\" the man replied: \"I have been sent by Ariaeus and Artaozus, who have been trusty friends to Cyrus in past days, and are your well-wishers. They warn you to be on your guard, in case the barbarians attack you in the night. There is a large body of troops in the neighbouring park. They also warn you to send and occupy the bridge over the Tigris, since Tissaphernes is minded to break it down in the night, if he can, so that you may not cross, but be caught between the river and the canal.\" On hearing this they took the man to Clearchus and acquainted him with his statement. Clearchus, on his side, was much disturbed, and indeed alarmed at the news. But a young fellow who was present, struck with an idea, suggested that the two statements were inconsistent; as to the contemplated attack and the proposed destruction of the bridge. Clearly, the attacking party must either conquer or be worsted: if they conquer, what need of their breaking down the bridge? \"Why! if there were half a dozen bridges,\" said he, \"we should not be any the more able to save ourselves by flight--there would be no place to flee to; but, in the opposite case, suppose we win, with the bridge broken down, it is they who will not be able to save themselves by flight; and, what is worse for them, not a single soul will be able to bring them succour from the other side, for all their numbers, since the bridge will be broken down.\"\n\n Possibly Xenophon himself.\n\nClearchus listened to the reasoning, and then he asked the messenger, \"How large the country between the Tigris and the canal might be?\" \"A 21 large district,\" he replied, \"and in it are villages and cities numerous and large.\" Then it dawned upon them: the barbarians had sent the man with subtlety, in fear lest the Hellenes should cut the bridge and occupy the island territory, with the strong defences of the Tigris on the one side and of the canal on the other; supplying themselves with provisions from the country so included, large and rich as it was, with no lack of hands to till it; in addition to which, a harbour of refuge and asylum would be found for any one, who was minded to do the king a mischief.\n\nAfter this they retired to rest in peace, not, however, neglecting to send a guard to occupy the bridge in spite of all, and there was no attack from any quarter whatsoever; nor did any of the enemy's people approach the bridges: so the guards were able to report next morning. But as soon as it was morning, they proceeded to cross the bridge, which consisted of thirty-seven vessels, and in so doing they used the utmost precaution possible; for reports were brought by some of the Hellenes with Tissaphernes that an attempt was to be made to attack them while crossing. All this turned out to be false, though it is true that while crossing they did catch sight of Glus watching, with some others, to see if they crossed the river; but as soon as he had satisfied himself on that point, he rode off and was gone.\n\nFrom the river Tigris they advanced four stages--twenty parasangs--to the river Physcus, which is a hundred feet broad and spanned by a bridge. Here lay a large and populous city named Opis, close to which the Hellenes were encountered by the natural brother of Cyrus and Artaxerxes, who was leading a large army from Susa and Ecbatana to assist the king. He halted his troops and watched the Helleens march past. Clearchus led them in column two abreast: and from time to time the vanguard came to a standstill, just so often and just so long the effect repeated itself down to the hindmost man: halt! halt! halt! along the whole line: so that even to the Hellenes themselves their army seemed enormous; and the Persian was fairly astonished at the spectacle.\n\nFrom this place they marched through Media six desert stages--thirty 27 parasangs--to the villages of Parysatis, Cyrus's and the king's mother. These Tissaphernes, in mockery of Cyrus, delivered over to the Hellenes to plunder, except that the folk in them were not to be made slaves. They contained much corn, cattle, and other property. From this place they advanced four desert stages--twenty parasangs--keeping the Tigris on the left. On the first of these stages, on the other side of the river, lay a large city; it was a well-to-do place named Caenae, from which the natives used to carry across loaves and cheeses and wine on rafts made of skins.\n\nV\n\nAfter this they reached the river Zapatas, which is four hundred 1 feet broad, and here they halted three days. During the interval suspicions were rife, though no act of treachery displayed itself. Clearchus accordingly resolved to bring to an end these feelings of mistrust, before they led to war. Consequently, he sent a messenger to the Persian to say that he desired an interview with him; to which the other readily consented. As soon as they were met, Clearchus spoke as follows: \"Tissaphernes,\" he said, \"I do not forget that oaths have been exchanged between us, and right hands shaken, in token that we will abstain from mutual injury; but I can see that you watch us narrowly, as if we were foes; and we, seeing this, watch you narrowly in return. But as I fail to discover, after investigation, that you are endeavouring to do us a mischief--and I am quite sure that nothing of the sort has ever entered our heads with regard to you--the best plan seemed to me to come and talk the matter over with you, so that, if possible, we might dispel the mutual distrust on either side. For I have known people ere now, the victims in some cases of calumny, or possibly of mere suspicion, who in apprehension of one another and eager to deal the first blow, have committed irreparable wrong against those who neither intended nor so much as harboured a thought of mischief against them. I have come to you under a conviction that such 6 misunderstandings may best be put a stop to by personal intercourse, and I wish to instruct you plainly that you are wrong in mistrusting us. The first and weightiest reason is that the oaths, which we took in the sight of heaven, are a barrier to mutual hostility. I envy not the man whose conscience tells him that he has disregarded these! For in a war with heaven, by what swiftness of foot can a man escape?--in what quarter find refuge?--in what darkness slink away and be hid?--to what strong fortress scale and be out of reach? Are not all things in all ways subject to the gods? is not their lordship over all alike outspread? As touching the gods, therefore, and our oaths, that is how I view this matter. To their safe keeping we consigned the friendship which we solemnly contracted. But turning to matters human, you I look upon as our greatest blessing in this present time. With you every path is plain to us, every river passable, and of provisions we shall know no stint. But without you, all our way is through darkness; for we known nothing concerning it, every river will be an obstacle, each multitude a terror; but, worst terror of all, the vast wilderness, so full of endless perplexity. Nay, if in a fit of madness we murdered you, what then? in slaying our benefactor should we not have challenged to enter the lists against us a more formidable antagonist in the king himself? Let me tell you, how many high hopes I should rob myself of, were I to take in hand to do you mischief.\n\n The Greater Zab, which flows into the Tigris near a town now called Senn, with which most travellers identify Caenae.\n\n\"I coveted the friendship of Cyrus; I believed him to be abler than any man of his day to benefit those whom he chose; but to-day I look and, behold, it is you who are in his place; the power which belonged 11 to Cyrus and his territory are yours now. You have them, and your own satrapy besides, safe and sound; while the king's power, which was a thorn in the side of Cyrus, is your support. This being so, it would be madness not to wish to be your friend. But I will go further and state to you the reasons of my confidence, that you on your side will desire our friendship. I know that the Mysians are a cause of trouble to you, and I flatter myself that with my present force I could render them humbly obedient to you. This applies to the Pisidians also; and I am told there are many other such tribes besides. I think I can deal with them all; they shall cease from being a constant distubance to your peace and prosperity. Then there are the Egyptians. I know your anger against them to-day is very great. Nor can I see what better force you will find to help you in chastising them than this which marches at my back to-day. Again, if you seek the friendship of any of your neighbours round, there shall be no friend so great as you; if any one annoys you, with us as your faithful servitors you shall belord it over him; and such service we will render you, not as hirelings merely for pay's sake, but for the gratitude which we shall rightly feel to you, to whom we owe our lives. As I dwell on these matters, I confess, the idea of your feeling mistrust of us is so astonishing, that I would give much to discover the name of the man, who is so clever of speech that he can persuade you that we harbour designs against you.\" Clearchus ended, and Tissaphernes responded thus--\n\n We learn from Diodorus Siculus, xiv. 35, that the Egyptians had revolted from the Persians towards the end of the reign of Darius.\n\n\"I am glad, Clearchus, to listen to your sensible remarks; for with the sentiments you hold, if you were to devise any mischief against me, it could only be out of malevolence to yourself. But if you imagine that you, on your side, have any better reason to mistrust the king and me, than we you, listen to me in turn, and I will undeceive you. I ask you, does it seem to you that we lack the means, if we had the will, to destroy you? have we not horsemen enough, or infantry, or whatever other arm you like, whereby we may be able to injure you, without risk of suffering in return? or, possibly, do we seem to you 17 to lack the physical surroundings suitable for attacking you? Do you not see all these great plains, which you find it hard enough to traverse even when they are friendly? and all yonder great mountain chains left for you to cross, which we can at any time occupy in advance and render impassable? and all those rivers, on whose banks we can deal craftily by you, checking and controlling and choosing the right number of you whom we care to fight! Nay, there are some which you will not be able to cross at all, unless we transport you to the other side.\n\n\"And if at all these points we were worsted, yet 'fire,' as they say, 'is stronger than the fruit of the field': we can burn it down and call up famine in arms against you; against which you, for all your bravery, will never be able to contend. Why then, with all these avenues of attack, this machinery of war, open to us, not one of which can be turned against ourselves, why should we select from among them all that method, which alone in the sight of God is impious and of man abominable? Surely it belongs to people altogether without resources, who are helplessly struggling in the toils of fate, and are villains to boot, to seek accomplishment of their desires by perjury to heaven and faithlessness to their fellows. We are not so unreasoning, Clearchus, nor so foolish.\n\n\"Why, when we had it in our power to destroy you, did we not proceed to do it? Know well that the cause of this was nothing less than my passion to prove myself faithful to the Hellenes, and that, as Cyrus went up, relying on a foreign force attracted by payment, I in turn might go down strong in the same through service rendered. Various ways in which you Hellenes may be useful to me you yourself have mentioned, but there is one still greater. It is the great king's privilege alone to wear the tiara upright upon his head, yet in your presence it may be given to another mortal to wear it upright, here, upon his heart.\"\n\nThroughout this speech he seemed to Clearchus to be speaking the truth, and he rejoined: \"Then are not those worthy of the worst 24 penalties who, in spite of all that exists to cement our friendship, endeavour by slander to make us enemies?\" \"Even so,\" replied Tissaphernes, \"and if your generals and captains care to come in some open and public way, I will name to you those who tell me that you are plotting against me and the army under me.\" \"Good,\" replied Clearchus. \"I will bring all, and I will show you, on my side, the source from which I derive my information concerning you.\"\n\nAfter this conversation Tissaphernes, with kindliest expression, invited Clearchus to remain with him at the time, and entertained him at dinner. Next day Clearchus returned to the camp, and made no secret of his persuasion that he at any rate stood high in the affections of Tissaphernes, and he reported what he had said, insisting that those invited ought to go to Tissaphernes, and that any Hellene convicted of calumnious language ought to be punished, not only as traitors themselves, but as disaffected to their fellow-countrymen. The slanderer and traducer was Menon; so, at any rate, he suspected, because he knew that he had had meetings with Tissaphernes whilst he was with Ariaeus, and was factiously opposed to himself, plotting how to win over the whole army to him, as a means of winning the good graces of Tissaphernes. But Clearchus wanted the entire army to give its mind to no one else, and that refractory people should be put out of the way. Some of the soldiers protested: the captains and generals had better not all go; it was better not to put too much confidence in Tissaphernes. But Clearchus insisted so strongly that finally it was arranged for five generals to go and twenty captains. These were accompanied by about two hundred of the other soldiers, who took the opportunity of marketing.\n\nOn arrival at the doors of Tissaphernes's quarters the generals were summoned inside. They were Proxenus the Boeotian, Menon the Thessalian, Agias the Arcadian, Clearchus the Laconian, and Socrates the Achaean; while the captains remained at the doors. Not long after that, at one and the same signal, those within were seized and those without cut down; after which some of the barbarian horsemen galloped over the plain, killing every Hellene they encountered, bond or free. 32 The Hellenes, as they looked from the camp, viewed that strange horsemanship with surprise, and could not explain to themselves what it all meant, until Nicarchus the Arcadian came tearing along for bare life with a wound in the belly, and clutching his protruding entrails in his hands. He told them all that had happened. Instantly the Hellenes ran to their arms, one and all, in utter consternation, and fully expecting that the enemy would instantly be down upon the camp. However, they did not all come; only Ariaeus came, and Artaozus and Mithridates, who were Cyrus's most faithful friends; but the interpreter of the Hellenes said he saw and recognised the brother of Tissaphernes also with them. They had at their back other Persians also, armed with cuirasses, as many as three hundred. As soon as they were within a short distance, they bade any general or captain of the Hellenes who might be there to approach and hear a message from the king. After this, two Hellene generals went out with all precaution. These were Cleanor the Orchomenian, and Sophaenetus the Stymphalion, attended by Xenophon the Athenian, who went to learn news of Proxenus. Cheirisophus was at the time away in a village with a party gathering provisions. As soon as they had halted within earshot, Ariaeus said: \"Hellenes, Clearchus being shown to have committed perjury and to have broken the truce, has suffered the penalty, and he is dead; but Proxenus and Menon, in return for having given information of his treachery, are in high esteem and honour. As to yourselves, the king demands your arms. He claims them as his, since they belonged to Cyrus, who was his slave.\" To this the Hellenes made answer by the mouth of Cleanor of Orchomenus, their spokesman, who said, addressing Ariaeus: \"Thou villain, Ariaeus, and you the rest of you, who were Cyrus's friends, have you no shame before God or man, first to swear to us that you have the same friends and the same enemies as we ourselves, and then to turn and betray us, making common cause with Tissaphernes, that most impious and villainous of men? With him you have murdered the very men to whom you gave your solemn word and oath, and to the rest of us turned traitors; and, having so done, 39 you join hand with our enemies to come against us.\" Ariaeus answered: \"There is no doubt but that Clearchus has been known for some time to harbour designs agaisnt Tissaphernes and Orontas, and all of us who side with them.\" Taking up this assertion, Xenophon said: \"Well, then, granting that Clearchus broke the truce contrary to our oaths, he has his deserts, for perjurers deserve to perish; but where are Proxenus and Menon, our generals and your good friends and benefactors, as you admit? Send them back to us. Surely, just because they are friends of both parites, they will try to give us the best advice for you and for us.\"\n\nAt this, the Asiatics stood discussing with one another for a long while, and then they went away without vouchsafing a word.\n\nVI\n\nThe generals who were thus seized were taken up to the king and there 1 decapitated. The first of these, Clearchus, was a thorough soldier, and a true lover of fighting. This is the testimony of all who knew him intimately. As long as the war between the Lacedaemonians and Athenians lasted, he could find occupation at home; but after the peace, he persuaded his own city that the Thracians were injuring the Hellenes, and having secured his object, set sail, empowered by the ephorate to make war upon the Thracians north of the Chersonese and Perinthus. But he had no sooner fairly started than, for some reason or other, the ephors changed their minds, and endeavoured to bring him back again from the isthmus. Thereupon he refused further obedience, and went off with sails set for the Hellespont. In consequence he was condemned to death by the Spartan authorities for disobedience to orders; and now, finding himself an exile, he came to Cyrus. Working on the feelings of that prince, in language described elsewhere, he received from his entertainer a present of ten thousand darics. Having got this money, he did not sink into a life of ease and indolence, but collected an army with it, carried on war against the Thracians, and 5 conquered them in battle, and from that date onwards harried and plundered them with war incessantly, until Cyrus wanted his army; whereupon he at once went off, in hopes of finding another sphere of warfare in his company.\n\nThese, I take it, were the characteristic acts of a man whose affections are set on warfare. When it is open to him to enjoy peace with honour, no shame, no injury attached, still he prefers war; when he may live at home at ease, he insists on toil, if only it may end in fighting; when it is given to him to keep his riches without risk, he would rather lessen his fortune by the pastime of battle. To put it briefly, war was his mistress; just as another man will spend his fortune on a favourite, or to gratify some pleasure, so he chose to squander his substance on soldiering.\n\nBut if the life of a soldier was a passion with him, he was none the less a soldier born, as herein appears; danger was a delight to him; he courted it, attacking the enemy by night or by day; and in difficulties he did not lose his head, as all who ever served in a campaign with him would with one consent allow. A good solder! the question arises, Was he equally good as a commander? It must be admitted that, as far as was compatible with his quality of temper, he was; none more so. Capable to a singular degree of devising how his army was to get supplies, and of actually getting them, he was also capable of impressing upon those about him that Clearchus must be obeyed; and that he brought about by the very hardness of his nature. With a scowling expression and a harshly-grating voice, he chastised with severity, and at times with such fury, that he was sorry afterwards himself for what he had done. Yet it was not without purpose that he applied the whip; he had a theory that there was no good to be got out of an unchastened army. A saying of his is recorded to the effect that the soldier who is to mount guard and keep his hands off his friends, and be ready to dash without a moment's hesitation against the foe--must fear his commander more than the enemy. Accordingly, in any strait, this was the man whom the soldiers were eager to obey, and they would have no other in his place. The 11 cloud which lay upon his brow, at those times lit up with brightness; his face became radiant, and the old sternness was so charged with vigour and knitted strength to meet the foe, that it savoured of salvation, not of cruelty. But when the pinch of danger was past, and it was open to them to go and taste subordination under some other officer, many forsook him. So lacking in grace of manner was he; but was ever harsh and savage, so that the feeling of the soldiers towards him was that of schoolboys to a master. In other words, though it was not his good fortune ever to have followers inspired solely by friendship or goodwill, yet those who found themselves under him, either by State appointment or through want, or other arch necessity, yielded him implicit obedience. From the moment that he led them to victory, the elements which went to make his soldiers efficient were numerous enough. There was the feeling of confidence in facing the foe, which never left them, and there was the dread of punishment at his hands to keep them orderly. In this way and to this extent he knew how to rule; but to play a subordinate part himself he had no great taste; so, at any rate, it was said. At the time of his death he must have been about fifty years of age.\n\nProxenus, the Boeotian, was of a different temperament. It had been the dream of his boyhood to become a man capable of great achievements. In obedience to this passionate desire it was, that he paid his fee to Gorgias of Leontini. After enojoying that teacher's society, he flattered himself that he must be at once qualified to rule; and while he was on friendly terms with the leaders of the age, he was not to be outdone in reciprocity of service. In this mood he 17 threw himself into the projects of Cyrus, and in return expected to derive from this essay the reward of a great name, large power, and wide wealth. But for all that he pitched his hopes so high, it was none the less evident that he would refuse to gain any of the ends he set before him wrongfully. Righteously and honourably he would obtain them, if he might, or else forego them. As a commander he had the art of leading gentlemen, but he failed to inspire adequately either respect for himself or fear in the soldiers under him. Indeed, he showed a more delicate regard for his soldiers than his subordinates for him, and he was indisputably more apprehensive of incurring their hatred than they were of losing their fidelity. The one thing needful to real and recognised generalship was, he thought, to praise the virtuous and to withhold praise from the evildoer. It can be easily understood, then, that of those who were brought in contact with him, the good and noble indeed were his well-wishers; but he laid himself open to the machinations of the base, who looked upon him as a person to be dealt with as they liked. At the time of his death he was only thirty years of age.\n\n The famous rhetorician of Leontini, 485-380 B.C. His fee was 100 minae.\n\n Proxenus, like Cyrus, is to some extent a prototype of the Cyrus of the \"Cyropaedia.\" In other words, the author, in delineating the portrait of his ideal prince, drew from the recollection of many princely qualities observed by him in the characters of many friends. Apart from the intrinsic charm of the story, the \"Anabasis\" is interesting as containing the raw material of experience and reflection which \"this young scholar or philosopher,\" our friend, the author, will one day turn to literary account.\n\nAs to Menon the Thessalian, the mainspring of his action was obvious; what he sought after insatiably was wealth. Rule he sought after only as a stepping-stone to larger spoils. Honours and high estate he craved for simply that he might extend the area of his gains; and if he studied to be on friendly terms with the powerful, it was in order that he might commit wrong with impunity. The shortest road to the achievement of his desires lay, he thought, through false swearing, lying, and cheating; for in his vocabulary simplicity and truth were synonyms of folly. Natural affection he clearly entertained for nobody. If he called a man his friend it might be looked upon as 23 certain that he was bent on ensnaring him. Laughter at an enemy he considered out of place, but his whole conversation turned upon the ridicule of his associates. In like manner, the possessions of his foes were secure from his designs, since it was no easy task, he thought, to steal from people on their guard; but it was his particular good fortune to have discovered how easy it is to rob a friend in the midst of his security. If it were a perjured person or a wrongdoer, he dreaded him as well armed and intrenched; but the honourable and the truth-loving he tried to practise on, regarding them as weaklings devoid of manhood. And as other men pride themselves on piety and truth and righteousness, so Menon prided himself on a capacity for fraud, on the fabrication of lies, on the mockery and scorn of friends. The man who was not a rogue he ever looked upon as only half educated. Did he aspire to the first place in another man's friendship, he set about his object by slandering those who stood nearest to him in affection. He contrived to secure the obedience of his solders by making himself an accomplice in their misdeeds, and the fluency with which he vaunted his own capacity and readiness for enormous guilt was a sufficient title to be honoured and courted by them. Or if any one stood aloof from him, he set it down as a meritorious act of kindness on his part that during their intercourse he had not robbed him of existence.\n\n For a less repulsive conception of Menon's character, however unhistorical, see Plato's \"Meno,\" and Prof. Jowlett's Introduction, \"Plato,\" vol. i. p. 265: \"He is a Thessalian Alcibiades, rich and luxurious--a spoilt child of fortune.\"\n\nAs to certain obscure charges brought against his character, these may certainly be fabrications. I confine myself to the following facts, which are known to all. He was in the bloom of youth when he procured from Aristippus the command of his mercenaries; he had not yet lost that bloom when he became exceedingly intimate with Ariaeus, a barbarian, whose liking for fair young men was the explanation; and before he had grown a beard himself, he had contracted a similar relationship with a bearded favourite named Tharypas. When his fellow-generals were put to death on the plea that they had marched with Cyrus against the king, he alone, although he had shared their conduct, was exempted from their fate. But after their deaths the vengeance of the king fell upon him, and he was put to death, not like 29 Clearchus and the others by what would appear to be the speediest of deaths--decapitation--but, as report says, he lived for a year in pain and disgrace and died the death of a felon.\n\nAgias the Arcadian and Socrates the Achaean were both among the sufferers who were put to death. To the credit, be it said, of both, no one ever derided either as cowardly in war: no one ever had a fault to find with either on the score of friendship. They were both about thirty-five years of age.\nBOOK III\n\n\n\nI\n\nAfter the generals had been seized, and the captains and soldiers who 1 formed their escort had been killed, the Hellenes lay in deep perplexity--a prey to painful reflections. Here were they at the king's gates, and on every side environing them were many hostile cities and tribes of men. Who was there now to furnish them with a market? Separated from Hellas by more than a thousand miles, they had not even a guide to point the way. Impassable rivers lay athwart their homeward route, and hemmed them in. Betrayed even by the Asiatics, at whose side they had marched with Cyrus to the attack, they were left in isolation. Without a single mounted trooper to aid them in pursuit: was it not perfectly plain that if they won a battle, their enemies would escape to a man, but if they were beaten themselves, not one soul of them would survive?\n\nHaunted by such thoughts, and with hearts full of despair, but few of them tasted food that evening; but few of them kindled even a fire, and many never came into camp at all that night, but took their rest where each chanced to be. They could not close their eyes for very pain and yearning after their fatherlands or their parents, the wife or child whom they never expected to look upon again. Such was the plight in which each and all tried to seek repose.\n\nNow there was in that host a certain man, an Athenian, Xenophon, who had accompanied Cyrus, neither as a general, nor as an officer, nor yet as a private soldier, but simply on the invitation of an old friend, Proxenus. This old friend had sent to fetch him from home, promising, if he would come, to introduce him to Cyrus, \"whom,\" said Proxenus, \"I consider to be worth my fatherland and more to me.\"\n\n The reader should turn to Grote's comments on the first appearance of Xenophon. He has been mentioned before, of course, more than once before; but he now steps, as the protagonist, upon the scene, and as Grote says: \"It is in true Homeric vein, and in something like Homeric language, that Xenophon (to whom we owe the whole narrative of the expedition) describes his dream, or the intervention of Oneiros, sent by Zeus, from which this renovating impulse took its rise.\"\n\nXenophon having read the letter, consulted Socrates the Athenian, whether he should accept or refuse the invitation. Socrates, who had a suspicion that the State of Athens might in some way look askance at my friendship with Cyrus, whose zealous co-operation with the Lacedaemonians against Athens in the war was not forgotten, advised Xenophon to go to Delphi and there to consult the god as to the desirability of such a journey. Xenophon went and put the question to Apollo, to which of the gods he must pray and do sacrifice, so that he might best accomplish his intended journey and return in safety, with good fortune. Then Apollo answered him: \"To such and such gods must thou do sacrifice,\" and when he had returned home he reported to Socrates the oracle. But he, when he heard, blamed Xenophon that he had not, in the first instance, inquired of the god, whether it were better for him to go or to stay, but had taken on himself to settle that point affirmatively, by inquiring straightway, how he might best 7 perform the journey. \"Since, however,\" continued Socrates, \"you did so put the question, you should do what the god enjoined.\" Thus, and without further ado, Xenophon offered sacrifice to those whom the god had named, and set sail on his voyage. He overtook Proxenus and Cyrus at Sardis, when they were just ready to start on the march up country, and was at once introduced to Cyrus. Proxenus eagerly pressed him to stop--a request which Cyrus with like ardour supported, adding that as soon as the campaign was over he would send him home. The campaign referred to was understood to be against the Pisidians. That is how Xenophon came to join the expedition, deceived indeed, though not by Proxenus, who was equally in the dark with the rest of the Hellenes, not counting Clearchus, as to the intended attack upon the king. Then, though the majority were in apprehension of the journey, which was not at all to their minds, yet, for very shame of one another and Cyrus, they continued to follow him, and with the rest went Xenophon.\n\nAnd now in this season of perplexity, he too, with the rest, was in sore distress, and could not sleep; but anon, getting a snatch of sleep, he had a dream. It seemed to him in a vision that there was a storm of thunder and lightning, and a bolt fell on his father's house, and thereupon the house was all in a blaze. He sprung up in terror, and pondering the matter, decided that in part the dream was good: in that he had seen a great light from Zeus, whilst in the midst of toil and danger. But partly too he feared it, for evidently it had come from Zeus the king. And the fire kindled all around--what could that mean but that he was hemmed in by various perplexities, and so could not escape from the country of the king? The full meaning, however, is to be discovered from what happened after the dream.\n\nThis is what took place. As soon as he was fully awake, the first clear thought which came into his head was, Why am I lying here? The night advances; with the day, it is like enough, the enemy will be upon us. If we are to fall into the hands of the king, what is left us but to face the most horrible of sights, and to suffer the most 13 fearful pains, and then to die, insulted, an ignominious death? To defend ourselves--to ward off that fate--not a hand stirs: no one is preparing, none cares; but here we lie, as though it were time to rest and take our ease. I too! what am I waiting for? a general to undertake the work? and from what city? am I waiting till I am older mysef and of riper age? older I shall never be, if to-day I betray myself to my enemies.\n\nThereupon he got up, and called together first Proxenus's officers; and when they were met, he said: \"Sleep, sirs, I cannot, nor can you, I fancy, nor lie here longer, when I see in what straits we are. Our enemy, we may be sure, did not open war upon us till he felt he had everything amply ready; yet none of us shows a corresponding anxiety to enter the lists of battle in the bravest style.\n\n\"And yet, if we yield ourselves and fall into the king's power, need we ask what our fate will be? This man, who, when his own brother, the son of the same parents, was dead, was not content with that, but severed head and hand from the body, and nailed them to a cross. We, then, who have not even the tie of blood in our favour, but who marched against him, meaning to make a slave of him instead of a king--and to slay him if we could: what is likely to be our fate at his hands? Will he not go all lengths so that, by inflicting on us the extreme of ignominy and torture, he may rouse in the rest of mankind a terror of ever marching against him any more? There is no question but that our business is to avoid by all means getting into his clutches.\n\n\"For my part, all the while the truce lasted, I never ceased pitying ourselves and congratulating the king and those with him, as, like a helpless spectator, I surveyed the extent and quality of their territory, the plenteousness of their provisions, the multitude of their dependants, their cattle, their gold, and their apparel. And then to turn and ponder the condition of our soldiers, without part or lot in these good things, except we bought it; few, I knew, had any longer the wherewithal to buy, and yet our oath held us down, so that we could not provide ourselves otherwise than by purchase. I say, as I 21 reasoned thus, there were times when I dreaded the truce more than I now dread war.\n\n\"Now, however, that they have abruptly ended the truce, there is an end also to their own insolence and to our suspicion. All these good things of theirs are now set as prizes for the combatants. To whichsoever of us shall prove the better men, will they fall as guerdons; and the gods themselves are the judges of the strife. The gods, who full surely will be on our side, seeing it is our enemies who have taken their names falsely; whilst we, with much to lure us, yet for our oath's sake, and the gods who were our witnesses, sternly held aloof. So that, it seems to me, we have a right to enter upon this contest with much more heart than our foes; and further, we are possessed of bodies more capable than theirs of bearing cold and heat and labour; souls too we have, by the help of heaven, better and braver; nay, the men themselves are more vulnerable, more mortal, than ourselves, if so be the gods vouchsafe to give us victory once again.\n\n\"Howbeit, for I doubt not elsewhere similar reflections are being made, whatsoever betide, let us not, in heaven's name, wait for others to come and challenge us to noble deeds; let us rather take the lead in stimulating the rest to valour. Show yourselves to be the bravest of officers, and among generals, the worthiest to command. For myself, if you choose to start forwards on this quest, I will follow; or, if you bid me lead you, my age shall be no excuse to stand between me and your orders. At least I am of full age, I take it, to avert misfortune from my own head.\"\n\nSuch were the speaker's words; and the officers, when they heard, all, with one exception, called upon him to put himself at their head. This was a certain Apollonides there present, who spoke in the Boeotian dialect. This man's opinion was that it was mere nonsense for any one to pretend they could obtain safety otherwise than by an appeal to the king, if he had skill to enforce it; and at the same time he began to dilate on the difficulties. But Xenophon cut him short. \"O most marvellous of men! though you have eyes to see, you do not perceive; though you have ears to hear, you do not recollect. You were present 27 with the rest of us now here when, after the death of Cyrus, the king, vaunting himself on that occurrence, sent dictatorially to bid us lay down our arms. But when we, instead of giving up our arms, put them on and went and pitched our camp near him, his manner changed. It is hard to say what he did not do, he was so at his wit's end, sending us embassies and begging for a truce, and furnishing provisions the while, until he had got it. Or to take the contrary instance, when just now, acting precisely on your principles, our generals and captains went, trusting to the truce, unarmed to a conference with them, what came of it? what is happening at this instant? Beaten, goaded with pricks, insulted, poor souls, they cannot even die: though death, I ween, would be very sweet. And you, who know all this, how can you say that it is mere nonsense to talk of self-defence? how can you bid us go again and try the arts of persuasion? In my opinion, sirs, we ought not to admit this fellow to the same rank with ourselves; rather ought we to deprive him of his captaincy, and load him with packs and treat him as such. The man is a disgrace to his own fatherland and the whole of Hellas, that, being a Hellene, he is what he is.\"\n\nHere Agasias the Stymphalian broke in, exclaiming: \"Nay, this fellow has no connection either with Boeotia or with Hellas, none whatever. I have noted both his ears bored like a Lydian's.\" And so it was. Him then they banished. But the rest visited the ranks, and wherever a general was left, they summoned the general; where he was gone, the lieutenant-general; and where again the captain alone was left, the captain. As soon as they were all met, they seated themselves in front of the place d'armes: the assembled generals and officers, numbering about a hundred. It was nearly midnight when this took place.\n\nThereupon Hieronymous the Eleian, the eldest of Proxenus's captains, commenced speaking as follows: \"Generals and captains, it seemed right to us, in view of the present crisis, ourselves to assemble and to summon you, that we might advise upon some practicable course. Would you, Xenophon, repeat what you said to us?\"\n\nThereupon Xenophon spoke as follows: \"We all know only too well, that 34 the king and Tissaphernes have seized as many of us as they could, and it is clear they are plotting to destroy the rest of us if they can. Our business is plain: it is to do all we can to avoid getting into the power of the barbarians; rather, if we can, we will get them into our power. Rely upon this then, all you who are here assembled, now is your great opportunity. The soldiers outside have their eyes fixed upon you; if they think that you are faint-hearted, they will turn cowards; but if you show them that you are making your own preparations to attack the enemy, and setting an example to the rest--follow you, be assured, they will: imitate you they will. May be, it is but right and fair that you should somewhat excel them, for you are generals, you are commanders of brigades or regiments; and if, while it was peace, you had the advantage in wealth and position, so now, when it is war, you are expected to rise superior to the common herd--to think for them, to toil for them, whenever there be need.\n\n\"At this very moment you would confer a great boon on the army, if you made it your business to appoint generals and officers to fill the places of those that are lost. For without leaders nothing good or noble, to put it concisely, was ever wrought anywhere; and in military matters this is absolutely true; for if discipline is held to be of saving virtue, the want of it has been the ruin of many ere now. Well, then! when you have appointed all the commanders necessary, it would only be opportune, I take it, if you were to summon the rest of the soldiers and speak some words of encouragement. Even now, I daresay you noticed yourselves the crestfallen air with which they came into camp, the despondency with which they fell to picket duty, so that, unless there is a change for the better, I do not know for what service they will be fit; whether by night, if need were, or even by day. The thing is to get them to turn their thoughts to what they mean to do, instead of to what they are likely to suffer. Do that, and their spirits will soon revive wonderfully. You know, I need hardly remind you, it is not numbers or strength that gives victory in war; but, heaven helping them, to one or other of two combatants it is 42 given to dash with stouter hearts to meet the foe, and such onset, in nine cases out of ten, those others refuse to meet. This observation, also, I have laid to heart, that they, who in matters of war seek in all ways to save their lives, are just they who, as a rule, die dishonourably; whereas they who, recognising that death is the common lot and destiny of all men, strive hard to die nobly: these more frequently, as I observe, do after all attain to old age, or, at any rate, while life lasts, they spend their days more happily. This lesson let all lay to heart this day, for we are just at such a crisis of our fate. Now is the season to be brave ourselves, and to stimulate the rest by our example.\"\n\nWith these words he ceased; and after him, Cheirisophus said: \"Xenophon, hitherto I knew only so much of you as that you were, I heard, an Athenian, but now I must commend you for your words and for your conduct. I hope that there may be many more like you, for it would prove a public blessing.\" Then turning to the officers: \"And now,\" said he, \"let us waste no time; retire at once, I beg you, and choose leaders where you need them. After you have made your elections, come back to the middle of the camp, and bring the newly appointed officers. After that, we will there summon a general meeting of the soldiers. Let Tolmides, the herald,\" he added, \"be in attendance.\" With these words on his lips he got up, in order that what was needful might be done at once without delay. After this the generals were chosen. These were Timasion the Dardanian, in place of Clearchus; Xanthicles, an Achaean, in place of Socrates; Cleanor, an Arcadian, in place of Agias; Philesius, an Achaean, in place of Menon; and in place of Proxenus, Xenophon the Athenian.\n\nII\n\nBy the time the new generals had been chosen, the first faint glimmer 1 of dawn had hardly commenced, as they met in the centre of the camp, and resolved to post an advance guard and to call a general meeting of the soldiers. Now, when these had come together, Cheirisophus the Lacedaemonian first rose and spoke as follows: \"Fellow-soldiers, the present posture of affairs is not pleasant, seeing that we are robbed of so many generals and captains and soldiers; and more than that, our 2 former allies, Ariaeus and his men, have betrayed us; still, we must rise above our circumstances to prove ourselves brave men, and not give in, but try to save ourselves by glorious victory if we can; or, if not, at least to die gloriously, and never, while we have breath in our bodies, fall into the hands of our enemies. In which latter case, I fear, we shall suffer things, which I pray the gods may visit rather upon those we hate.\"\n\nAt this point Cleanor the Ochomenian stood up and spoke as follows: \"You see, men, the perjury and the impiety of the king. You see the faithlessness of Tissaphernes, professing that he was next-door neighbour to Hellas, and would give a good deal to save us, in confirmation of which he took an oath to us himself, he gave us the pledge of his right hand, and then, with a lie upon his lips, this same man turned round and arrested our generals. He had no reverence even for Zeus, the god of strangers; but, after entertaining Clearchus at his own board as a friend, he used his hospitality to delude and decoy his victims. And Ariaeus, whom we offered to make king, with whom we exchanged pledges not to betray each other, even this man, without a particle of fear of the gods, or respect for Cyrus in his grave, though he was most honoured by Cyrus in lifetime, even he has turned aside to the worst foes of Cyrus, and is doing his best to injure the dead man's friends. Them may the gods requite as they deserve! But we, with these things before our eyes, will not any more be cheated and cajoled by them; we will make the best fight we can, and having made it, whatever the gods think fit to send, we will accept.\"\n\nAfter him Xenophon arose; he was arrayed for war in his bravest apparel: \"For,\" said he to himself, \"if the gods grant victory, the finest attire will match with victory best; or if I must needs die, then for one who has aspired to the noblest, it is well there should be some outward correspondence between his expectation and his end.\" He began his speech as follows: \"Cleanor has spoken of the perjury and 8 faithlessness of the barbarians, and you yourselves know them only too well, I fancy. If then we are minded to enter a second time into terms of friendship with them, with the experience of what our generals, who in all confidence entrusted themselves to their power, have suffered, reason would we should feel deep despondency. If, on the other hand, we purpose to take our good swords in our hands and to inflict punishment on them for what they have done, and from this time forward will be on terms of downright war with them, then, God helping, we have many a bright hope of safety.\" The words were scarcely spoken when someone sneezed, and with one impulse the soldiers bowed in worship; and Xenophon proceeded: \"I propose, sirs, since, even as we spoke of safety, an omen from Zeus the Saviour has appeared, we vow a vow to sacrifice to the Saviour thank-offerings for safe deliverance, wheresoever first we reach a friendly country; and let us couple with that vow another of individual assent, that we will offer to the rest of the gods 'according to our ability.' Let all those who are in favour of this proposal hold up their hands.\" They all held up their hands, and there and then they vowed a vow and chanted the battle hymn. But as soon as these sacred matters were duly ended, he began once more thus: \"I was saying that many and bright are the hopes we have of safety. First of all, we it is who confirm and ratify the oaths we take by heaven, but our enemies have taken false oaths and broken the truce, contrary to their solemn word. This being so, it is but natural that the gods should be opposed to our enemies, but with ourselves allied; the gods, who are able to make the great ones quickly small, and out of sore perplexity can save the little ones with ease, what time it pleases them. In the next place, let me recall to your minds the dangers of our own forefathers, that you may see and 11 know that bravery is your heirloom, and that by the aid of the gods brave men are rescued even out of the midst of sorest straits. So was it when the Persians came, and their attendant hosts, with a very great armament, to wipe out Athens from the face of the earth--the men of Athens had the heart to withstand them and conquered them. Then they vowed to Artemis that for every man they slew of the enemy, they would sacrifice to the goddess goats so many; and when they could not find sufficient for the slain, they resolved to offer yearly five hundred; and to this day they perform that sacrifice. And at a somewhat later date, when Xerxes assembled his countless hosts and marched upon Hellas, then too our fathers conquered the forefathers of our foes by land and by sea.\n\n So it is said of the Russian General Skobelef, that he had a strange custom of going into battle in his cleanest uniform, perfurmed, and wearing a diamond-hilted sword, \"in order that,\" as he said, \"he might die in his best attire.\"\n\n For this ancient omen see \"Odyssey,\" xvii. 541: \"Even as she spake, and Telemachus sneezed loudly, and around the roof rung wondrously. And Penelope laughed.\" . . . \"Dost thou not mark how my son has sneezed a blessing on all my words?\"\n\n See Herod. vi. 114; the allusion is to the invasion of Greeze by Datis and Artaphernes, and to their defeat at Marathon, B.C. 490. \"Heredotus estimates the number of those who fell on the Persian side at 6400 men: the number of Athenian dead is accurately known, since all were collected for the last solemn obsequies--they were 192.\"--Grote, \"Hist. of Greece,\" vol. v. p. 475.\n\n Then = at Salamis, B.C. 480, and at Plataea and Mycale, B.C. 479, on the same day.\n\n\"And proofs of these things are yet to be seen in trophies; but the greatest witness of all is the freedom of our cities--the liberty of that land in which you were born and bred. For you call no man master or lord; you bow your heads to none save to the gods alone. Such were your forefathers, and their sons are ye. Think not I am going to say that you put to shame in any way your ancestry--far from it. Not many days since, you too were drawn up in battle face to face with these true descendants of their ancestors, and by the help of heaven you conquered them, though they many times outnumbered you. At that time, it was to win a throne for Cyrus that you showed your bravery; to-day, when the struggle is for your own salvation, what is more natural than that you should show yourselves braver and more zealous still. Nay, it is very meet and right that you should be more undaunted still to-day to face the foe. The other day, though you had not tested them, and before your eyes lay their immeasurable host, you had the heart to go against them with the spirit of your fathers. To-day you have made 16 trial of them, and knowing that, however many times your number, they do not care to await your onset, what concern have you now to be afraid of them?\n\n\"Nor let any one suppose that herein is a point of weakness, in that Cyrus's troops, who before were drawn up by your side, have now deserted us, for they are even worse cowards still than those we worsted. At any rate they have deserted us, and sought refuge with them. Leaders of the forlorn hope of flight--far better is it to have them brigaded with the enemy than shoulder to shoulder in our ranks. But if any of you is out of heart to think that we have no cavalry, while the enemy have many squadrons to command, lay to heart this doctrine, that ten thousand horse only equal ten thousand men upon their backs, neither less nor more. Did any one ever die in battle from the bite or kick of a horse? It is the men, the real swordsmen, who do whatever is done in battles. In fact we, on our stout shanks, are better mounted than those cavalry fellows; there they hang on to their horses' necks in mortal dread, not only of us, but of falling off; while we, well planted upon earth, can deal far heavier blows to our assailants, and aim more steadily at who we will. There is one point, I admit, in which their cavalry have the whip-hand of us; it is safer for them than it is for us to run away.\n\n\"May be, however, you are in good heart about the fighting, but annoyed to think that Tissaphernes will not guide us any more, and that the king will not furnish us with a market any longer. Now, consider, is it better for us to have a guide like Tissaphernes, whom we know to be plotting against us, or to take our chance of the stray people whom we catch and compel to guide us, who will know that any mistake made in leading us will be a sad mistake for their own lives? Again, is it better to be buying provisions in a market of their providing, in scant measure and at high prices, without even the money to pay for them any longer; or, by right of conquest, to help ourselves, applying such measure as suits our fancy best?\n\n\"Or again, perhaps you admit tht our present position is not without its advantages, but you feel sure that the rivers are a difficulty, and think that you were never more taken in than when you crossed 22 them; if so, consider whether, after all, this is not perhaps the most foolish thing which the barbarians have done. No river is impassable throughout; whatever difficulties it may present at some distance from its source, you need only make your way up to the springhead, and there you may cross it without wetting more than your ankles. But, granted that the rivers do bar our passage, and that guides are not forthcoming, what care we? We need feel no alarm for all that. We have heard of the Mysians, a people whom we certainly cannot admit to be better than ourselves; and yet they inhabit numbers of large and prosperous cities in the king's own country without asking leave. The Pisidians are an equally good instance, or the Lycaonians. We have seen with our own eyes how they fare: seizing fortresses down in the plains, and reaping the fruits of these men's territory. As to us, I go so far as to assert, we ought never to have let it be seen that we were bent on getting home: at any rate, not so soon; we should have begun stocking and furnishing ourselves, as if we fully meant to settle down for life somewhere or other hereabouts. I am sure that the king would be thrice glad to give the Mysians as many guides as they like, or as many hostages as they care to demand, in return for a safe conduct out of his country; he would make carriage roads for them, and if they preferred to take their departure in coaches and four, he would not say them nay. So too, I am sure, he would be only too glad to accommodate us in the same way, if he saw us preparing to settle down here. But, perhaps, it is just as well that we did not stop; for I fear, if once we learn to live in idleness and to batten in luxury and dalliance with these tall and handsome Median and Persian women and maidens, we shall be like the Lotus-eaters, and forget the road home altogether.\n\n See \"Odyssey,\" ix. 94, \"ever feeding on the Lotus and forgetful of returning.\"\n\n\"It seems to me that it is only right, in the first instance, to make an effort to return to Hellas and to revisit our hearths and homes, if only to prove to other Hellenes that it is their own faults if they are poor and needy, seeing it is in their power to give to those 26 now living a pauper life at home a free passage hither, and convert them into well-to-do burghers at once. Now, sirs, is it not clear that all these good things belong to whoever has strength to hold them?\n\n Here seems to be the germ--unless, indeed, the thought had been conceived above--here at any rate the first conscious expression of the colonisation scheme, of which we shall hear more below, in reference to Cotyora; the Phasis; Calpe. It appears again fifty years later in the author's pamphlet \"On Revenues,\" chapters i. and vi. For the special evils of the fourth century B.C., and the growth of pauperism between B.C. 401 and 338, see Jebb, \"Attic Orators,\" vol i. p. 17.\n\n\"Let us look another matter in the face. How are we to march most safely? or where blows are needed, how are we to fight to the best advantage? That is the question.\n\n\"The first thing which I recommend is to burn the wagons we have got, so that we may be free to march wherever the army needs, and not, practically, make our baggage train our general. And, next, we should throw our tents into the bonfire also: for these again are only a trouble to carry, and do not contribute one grain of good either for fighting or getting provisions. Further, let us get rid of all superfluous baggage, save only what we require for the sake of war, or meat and drink, so that as many of us as possible may be under arms, and as few as possible doing porterage. I need not remind you that, in case of defeat, the owners' goods are not their own; but if we master our foes, we will make them our baggage bearers.\n\n\"It only rests for me to name the one thing which I look upon as the greatest of all. You see, the enemy did not dare to bring war to bear upon us until they had first seized our generals; they felt that whilst our rulers were there, and we obeyed them, they were no match for us in war; but having got hold of them, they fully expected that the consequent confusion and anarchy would prove fatal to us. What follows? This: Officers and leaders ought to be more vigilant ever than their predecessors; subordinates still more orderly and obedient to those in command now than even they were to those who are gone. And you should pass a resolution that, in case of insubordination, any one 31 who stands by is to aid the officer in chastising the offender. So the enemy will be mightily deceived; for on this day they will behold ten thousand Clearchuses instead of one, who will not suffer one man to play the coward. And now it is high time I brought my remarks to an end, for may be the enemy will be here anon. Let those who are in favour of these proposals confirm them with all speed, that they may be realised in fact; or if any other course seem better, let not any one, even though he be a private soldier, shrink from proposing it. Our common safety is our common need.\"\n\nAfter this Cheirisophus spoke. He said: \"If there is anything else to be done, beyond what Xenophon has mentioned, we shall be able to carry it out presently; but with regard to what he has already proposed, it seems to me the best course to vote upon the matters at once. Those who are in favour of Xenophon's proposals, hold up their hands.\" They all held them up. Xenophon rose again and said: \"Listen, sirs, while I tell you what I think we have need of besides. It is clear that we must march where we can get provisions. Now, I am told there are some splendid villages not more than two miles and a half distant. I should not be surprised, then, if the enemy were to hang on our heels and dog us as we retire, like cowardly curs which rush out at the passer-by and bite him if they can, but when you turn upon them they run away. Such will be their tactics, I take it. It may be safer, then, to march in a hollow square, so as to place the baggage animals and our mob of sutlers in greater security. It will save time to make the appointments at once, and to settle who leads the square and directs the vanguard; who will take command of the two flanks, and who of the rearguard; so that, when the enemy appears, we shall not need to deliberate, but can at once set in motion the machinery in existence.\n\n\"If any one has any better plan, we need not adopt mine; but if not, suppose Cheirisophus takes the lead, as he is a Lacedaemonian, and the two eldest generals take in charge the two wings respectively, whilst Timasion and I, the two youngest, will for the present guard the rear. 37 For the rest, we can but make experiment of this arrangement, and alter it with deliberation, as from time to time any improvement suggests itself. If any one has a better plan to propose, let him do so.\" . . . No dissentient voice was heard. Accordingly he said: \"Those in favour of this resolution, hold up their hands.\" The resolution was carried. \"And now,\" said he, \"it would be well to separate and carry out what we have decreed. If any of you has set his heart on seeing his friends again, let him remember to prove himself a man; there is no other way to achieve his heart's wish. Or is mere living an object with any of you, strive to conquer; if to slay is the privilege of victory, to die is the doom of the defeated. Or perhaps to gain money and wealth is your ambition, strive again for mastery; have not conquerors the double gain of keeping what is their own, whilst they seize the possessions of the vanquished?\"\n\nIII\n\nThe speaking was ended; they got up and retired; then they burnt the 1 wagons and the tents, and after sharing with one another what each needed out of their various superfluities, they threw the remnant into the fire. Having done that, they proceeded to make their breakfasts. While they were breakfasting, Mithridates came with about thirty horsemen, and summoning the generals within earshot, he thus addressed them: \"Men of Hellas, I have been faithful to Cyrus, as you know well, and to-day I am your well-wisher; indeed, I am here spending my days in great fear: if then I could see any salutory course in prospect, I should be disposed to join you with all my retainers. Please inform me, then, as to what you propose, regarding me as your friend and well-wisher, anxious only to pursue his march in your company.\" The generals held council, and resolved to give the following answer, Cheirisophus acting as spokesman: \"We have resolved to make our way through the country, inflicting the least possible damage, provided we are allowed a free passage homewards; but if any one tries to hinder 3 us, he will have to fight it out with us, and we shall bring all the force in our power to bear.\" Thereat Mithridates set himself to prove to them that their deliverance, except with the king's good pleasure, was hopeless. Then the meaning of his mission was plain. He was an agent in disguise; in fact, a relation of Tissaphernes was in attendance to keep a check on his loyalty. After that, the generals resolved that it would be better to proclaim open war, without truce or herald, as long as they were in the enemy's country; for they used to come and corrupt the soldiers, and they were even successful with one officer--Nicarchus, an Arcadian, who went off in the night with about twenty men.\n\n Can this be the same man whose escape is so graphically described above?\n\nAfter this, they breakfasted and crossed the river Zapatas, marching in regular order, with the beasts and mob of the army in the middle. They had not advanced far on their route when Mithridates made his appearance again, with about a couple of hundred horsemen at his back, and bowmen and slingers twice as many, as nimble fellows as a man might hope to see. He approached the Hellenes as if he were friendly; but when they had got fairly to close quarters, all of a sudden some of them, whether mounted or on foot, began shooting with their bows and arrows, and another set with slings, wounding the men. The rearguard of the Hellenes suffered for a while severely without being able to retaliate, for the Cretans had a shorter range than the Persians, and at the same time, being light-armed troops, they lay cooped up within the ranks of the heavy infantry, while the javelin men again did not shoot far enough to reach the enemy's slingers. This being so, Xenophon thought there was nothing for it but to charge, and charge they did; some of the heavy and light infantry, who were guarding the rear, with him; but for all their charging they did not catch a single man.\n\nThe dearth of cavalry told against the Hellenes; nor were their infantry able to overhaul the enemy's infantry, with the long start they had, and considering the shortness of the race, for it was out of the question to pursue them far from the main body of the army. On the 10 other hand, the Asiatic cavalry, even while fleeing, poured volleys of arrows behind their backs, and wounded the pursuers; while the Hellenes must fall back fighting every step of the way they had measured in the pursuit; so that by the end of that day they had not gone much more than three miles; but in the late afternoon they reached the villages.\n\nHere there was a return of the old despondency. Cheirisophus and the eldest of the generals blamed Xenophon for leaving the main body to give chase and endangering himself thereby, while he could not damage the enemy one whit the more. Xenophon admitted that they were right in blaming him: no better proof of that was wanted than the result. \"The fact is,\" he added, \"I was driven to pursue; it was too trying to look on and see our men suffer so badly, and be unable to retaliate. However, when we did charge, there is no denying the truth of what you say; we were not a whit more able to injure the enemy, while we had considerable difficulty in beating a retreat ourselves. Thank heaven they did not come upon us in any great force, but were only a handful of men; so that the injury they did us was not large, as it might have been; and at least it has served to show us what we need. At present the enemy shoot and sling beyond our range, so that our Cretan archers are no match for them; our hand-throwers cannot reach as far; and when we pursue, it is not possible to push the pursuit to any great distance from the main body, and within the short distance no foot-soldier, however fleet of foot, could overtake another foot-soldier who has a bow-shot the start of him. If, then, we are to exclude them from all possibility of injuring us as we march, we must get slingers as soon as possible and cavalry. I am told there are in the army some Rhodians, most of whom, they say, know how to sling, and their missile will reach even twice as far as the Persian slings (which, on account of their being loaded with stones as big as one's fist, have a comparatively short range; but the Rhodians are skilled in the use of leaden bullets). Suppose, then, we investigate and 18 find out first of all who among them possess slings, and for these slings offer the owner the money value; and to another, who will plait some more, hand over the money price; and for a third, who will volunteer to be enrolled as a slinger, invent some other sort of privilege, I think we shall soon find people to come forward capable of helping us. There are horses in the army I know; some few with myself, others belonging to Clearchus's stud, and a good many others captured from the enemy, used for carrying baggage. Let us take the pick of these, supplying their places by ordinary baggage animals, and equipping the horses for cavalry. I should not wonder if our troopers gave some annoyance to these fugitives.\"\n\n These words sound to me like an author's note, parenthetically, and perhaps inadvertently, inserted into the text. It is an \"aside\" to the reader, which in a modern book would appear as a footnote.\n\nThese proposals were carried, and that night two hundred slingers were enrolled, and next day as many as fifty horse and horsemen passed muster as duly qualified; buff jackets and cuirasses were provided for them, and a commandant of cavalry appointed to command--Lycius, the son of Polystratus, by name, an Athenian.\n\nIV\n\nThat day they remained inactive, but the next they rose earlier than 1 usual, and set out betimes, for they had a ravine to cross, where they feared the enemy might attack them in the act of crossing. When they were across, Mithridates appeared again with one thousand horse, and archers and slingers to the number of four thousand. This whole body he had got by request from Tissaphernes, and in return he undertook to deliver up the Hellenes to Tissaphernes. He had grown contemptuous since his late attack, when, with so small a detachment, he had done, as he thought, a good deal of mischief, without the slightest loss to himself.\n\nWhen the Hellenes were not only right across, but had got about a mile from the ravine, Mithridates also crossed with his forces. An order had been passed down the lines, what light infantry and what heavy infantry were to take part in the pursuit; and the cavalry were instructed to follow up the pursuit with confidence, as a considerable 3 support was in their rear. So, when Mithridates had come up with them, and they were well within arrow and sling shot, the bugle sounded the signal to the Hellenes; and immediately the detachment under orders rushed to close quarters, and the cavalry charged. There the enemy preferred not to wait, but fled towards the ravine. In this pursuit the Asiatics lost several of their infantry killed, and of their cavalry as many as eighteen were taken prisoners in the ravine. As to those who were slain the Hellenes, acting upon impulse, mutilated their bodies, by way of impressing their enemy with as frightful an image as possible.\n\nSo fared the foe and so fell back; but the Hellenes, continuing their march in safety for the rest of that day, reached the river Tigris. Here they came upon a large deserted city, the name of which was Larissa: a place inhabited by the Medes in days of old; the breadth of its walls was twenty-five feet, and the height of them a hundred, and the circuit of the whole two parasangs. It was built of clay-bricks, supported on a stone basis twenty feet high. This city the king of the Persians besieged, what time the Persians strove to snatch their empire from the Medes, but he could in no wise take it; then a cloud hid the face of the sun and blotted out the light thereof, until the inhabitants were gone out of the city, and so it was taken. By the side of this city there was a stone pyramid in breadth a hundred feet, and in height two hundred feet; in it were many of the barbarians who had fled for refuge from the neighbouring villages.\n\n Larissa, on the side of the modern Nimrud (the south-west corner, as is commonly supposed, of Nineveh). The name is said to mean \"citadel,\" and is given to various Greek cities (of which several occur in Xenophon).\n\n I.e. Cyrus the Great.\n\nFrom this place they marched one stage of six parasangs to a great deserted fortress , and the name of that city was Mespila. The Medes once dwelt in it. The basement was 10 made of polished stone full of shells; fifty feet was the breadth of it, and fifty feet the height; and on this basement was reared a wall of brick, the breadth whereof was fifty feet and the height thereof four hundred; and the circuit of the wall was six parasangs. Hither, as the story goes, Medea, the king's wife, betook herself in flight what time the Medes lost their empire at the hands of the Persians. To this city also the king of the Pesians laid siege, but could not take it either by length of days or strength of hand. But Zeus sent amazement on the inhabitants thereof, and so it was taken.\n\n Opposite Mosul, the north-west portion of the ancient Nineveh, about eighteen miles above Larissa. The circuit of Nineveh is said to have been about fifty-six miles. It was overthrown by Cyrus in B.C. 558.\n\n The wife of Astyages, the last king of Media. Some think \"the wall of Media\" should be \"Medea's wall,\" constructed in the period of Queen Nitocris, B.C. 560.\n\nFrom this place they marched one stage--four parasangs. But, while still on this stage, Tissaphernes made his appearance. He had with him his own cavalry and a force belonging to Orontas, who had the king's daughter to wife; and there were, moreover, with them the Asiatics whom Cyrus had taken with him on his march up; together with those whom the king's brother had brought as a reinforcement to the king; besides those whom Tissaphernes himself had received as a gift from the king, so that the armament appeared to be very great. When they were close, he halted some of his regiments at the rear and wheeled others into position on either flank, but hesitated to attack, having no mind apparently to run any risks, and contenting himself with an order to his slingers to sling and his archers to shoot. But when the Rhodian slingers and the bowmen, posted at intervals, retaliated, and every shot told (for with the utmost pains to miss it would have been hard to do so under the circumstanecs), then Tissaphernes with all speed retired out of range, the other regiments following suit; and for the rest of the day the one party advanced and the other followed. But now the Asiatics had ceased to be dangerous with their sharpshooting. For the Rhodians could reach further than the Persian 16 slingers, or, indeed, than most of the bowmen. The Persian bows are of great size, so that the Cretans found the arrows which were picked up serviceable, and persevered in using their enemies' arrows, and practised shooting with them, letting them fly upwards to a great height. There were also plenty of bowstrings found in the villages--and lead, which they turned to account for their slings. As a result of this day, then, the Hellenes chancing upon some villages had no sooner encamped than the barbarians fell back, having had distinctly the worst of it in the skirmishing.\n\n The best MSS read {Skuthai}, Scythians; if this is correct, it is only the technical name for \"archers.\" Cf. Arrian, \"Tact.\" ii. 13. The police at Athens were technically so called, as being composed of Scythian slaves. Cf. Aristoph. \"Thesm.\" 1017.\n\n I.e., in practising, in order to get the maximum range they let fly the arrows, not horizontally, but up into the air. Sir W. Raleigh (Hist. of the World, III. x. 8) says that Xenophon \"trained his archers to short compass, who had been accustomed to the point blank,\" but this is surely not Xenophon's meaning.\n\nThe next day was a day of inaction: they halted and took in supplies, as there was much corn in the villages; but on the day following, the march was continued through the plain (of the Tigris), and Tissaphernes still hung on their skirts with his skirmishers. And now it was that the Hellenes discovered the defect of marching in a square with an enemy following. As a matter of necessity, whenever the wings of an army so disposed draw together, either where a road narrows, or hills close in, or a bridge has to be crossed, the heavy infantry cannot help being squeezed out of their ranks, and march with difficulty, partly from actual pressure, and partly from the general confusion that ensues. Or, supposing the wings are again extended, the troops have hardly recovered from their former distress before they are pulled asunder, and there is a wide space between the wings, and the men concerned lose confidence in themselves, especially with an enemy close behind. What happened, when a bridge had to be crossed or other passage effected, was, that each unit of the force pressed on in anxiety to get over first, and at these moments it was easy for the enemy to make an attack. The generals accordingly, having recognsied the defect, set about curing it. To do so, they made six lochi, or divisions of a hundred men apiece, each of which had its own set of captains and under-officers in command of half and quarter companies. 21 It was the duty of these new companies, during a march, whenever the flanks needed to close in, to fall back to the rear, so as to disencumber the wings. This they did by wheeling clear of them. When the sides of the oblong again extended, they filled up the interstices, if the gap were narrow, by columns of companies, if broader, by columns of half-companies, or, if broader still, by columns of quarter-companies, so that the space between was always filled up. If again it were necessary to effect a passage by bridge or otherwise, there was no confusion, the several companies crossing in turns; or, if the occasion arose to form in line of battle, these companies came up to the front and fell in.\n\n In the passage above I have translated {lokhoi} companies, and, as usual, {lokhagoi} captains. The half company is technically called a pentecostys, and a quarter company an enomoty, and the officers in charge of them respectively penteconter and enomotarch. These would be equivalent nearly to our subalterns and sergeants, and in the evolutions described would act as guides and markers in charge of their sections. Grote thinks there were six companies formed on each flank--twelve in all. See \"Hist. of Greece,\" vol. ix. p. 123, note (1st ed.)\n\nIn this way they advanced four stages, but ere the fifth was completed, they came in sight of a palace of some sort, with villages clustered round it; they could further see that the road leading to this place pursued its course over high undulating hillocks, the spur of the mountain range, under which lay the village. These knolls were a welcome sight to the Hellenes, naturally enough, as the enemy were cavalry. However, when they had issued from the plain and ascended the first crest, and were in the act of descending it so as to mount the next, at this juncture the barbarians came upon them. From the high ground down the sheer steep they poured a volley of darts, slingstones, and arrows, which they discharged \"under the lash,\" wounding many, until they got the better of the Hellenic light troops, and drove them for shelter behind the heavy infantry, so that this day that arm was altogether useless, huddling in the mob of sutlers, both 26 slingers and archers alike.\n\n I.e. the Persian leaders were seen flogging their men to the attack. Cf. Herod. vii. 22. 3.\n\nBut when the Hellenes, being so pressed, made an attempt to pursue, they could barely scale to the summit, being heavy-armed troops, while the enemy as lightly sprung away; and they suffered similarly in retiring to join the rest of the army. And then, on the second hill, the whole had to be gone through again; so that when it came to the third hillock, they determined not to move the main body of troops from their position until they had brought up a squadron of light infantry from the right flank of the square to a point on the mountain range. When this detachment were once posted above their pursuers, the latter desisted from attacking the main body in its descent, for fear of being cut off and finding themselves between two assailants. Thus the rest of the day they moved on in two divisions: one set keeping to the road by the hillocks, the other marching parallel on the higher level along the mountains; and thus they reached the villages and appointed eight surgeons to attend to the many wounded.\n\nHere they halted three days for the sake of the wounded chiefly, while a further inducement was the plentiful supply of provisions which they found, wheat and wine, and large stores of barley laid up for horses. These supplies had been collected by the ruling satrap of the country. On the fourth day they began their descent into the plain; but when Tissaphernes overtook them, necessity taught them to camp in the first village they caught sight of, and give over the attempt of marching and fighting simultaneously, as so many were hors de combat, being either on the list of wounded themselves, or else engaged in carrying the wounded, or laden with the heavy arms of those so occupied. But when they were once encamped, and the barbarians, advancing upon the village, made an attempt to harass them with their sharp-shooters, the superiority of the Hellenes was pronounced. To sustain a running fight with an enemy constantly attacking was one thing; to keep him at arm's length from a fixed base of action another: and the difference was much in their favour.\n\nBut when it was late afternoon, the time had come for the enemy to 34 withdraw, since the habit of the barbarian was never to encamp within seven or eight miles of the Hellenic camp. This he did in apprehension of a night attack, for a Persian army is good for nothing at night. Their horses are haltered, and, as a rule, hobbled as well, to prevent their escaping, as they might if loose; so that, if any alarm occurs, the trooper has to saddle and bridle his horse, and then he must put on his own cuirass, and then mount--all which performances are difficult at night and in the midst of confusion. For this reason they always encamped at a distance from the Hellenes.\n\nWhen the Hellenes perceived that they were preparing to retire, and that the order was being given, the herald's cry, \"Pack up for starting,\" might be heard before the enemy was fairly out of earshot. For a while the Asiatics paused, as if unwilling to be gone; but as night closed in, off they went, for it did not suit their notions of expediency to set off on a march and arrive by night. And now, when the Hellenes saw that they were really and clearly gone, they too broke up their camp and pursued their march till they had traversed seven and a half miles. Thus the distance between the two armies grew to be so great, that the next day the enemy did not appear at all, nor yet on the third day; but on the fourth the barbarians had pushed on by a forced night march and occupied a commanding position on the right, where the Hellenes had to pass. It was a narrow mountain spur overhanging the descent into the plain.\n\n Lit. \"a mere nail tip.\"\n\nBut when Cheirisophus saw that this ridge was occupied, he summoned Xenophon from the rear, bidding him at the same time to bring up peltasts to the front. That Xenophon hesitated to do, for Tissaphernes and his whole army were coming up and were well within sight. Galloping up to the front himself, he asked: \"Why do you summon me?\" The other answered him: \"The reason is plain; look yonder; this crest which overhangs our descent has been occupied. There is no passing, 39 until we have dislodged these fellows; why have you not brought up the light infantry?\" Xenophon explained: he had not thought it desirable to leave the rear unprotected, with an enemy appearing in the field of view. \"However, it is time,\" he added, \"to decide how we are to dislodge these fellows from the crest.\" At this moment his eye fell on the peak of the mountain, rising immediately above their army, and he could see an approach leading from it to the crest in question where the enemy lay. He exclaimed: \"The best thing we can do, Cheirisophus, is to make a dash at the height itself, and with what speed we may. If we take it, the party in command of the road will never be able to stop. If you like, stay in command of the army, and I will go; or, if you prefer, do you go to the mountain, and I will stay here.\"--\"I leave it to you,\" Cheirisophus answered, \"to choose which you like best.\" Xenophon remarking, \"I am the younger,\" elected to go; but he stipulated for a detachment from the front to accompany him, since it was a long way to fetch up troops from the rear. Accordingly Cheirisophus furnished him with the light infantry from the front, reoccupying their place by those from the centre. He also gave him, to form part of the detachment, the three hundred of the picked corps under his own command at the head of the square.\n\n Some think that these three hundred are three of the detached companies described above; others, that they were a picked corps in attendance on the commander-in-chief.\n\nThey set out from the low ground with all the haste imaginable. But the enemy in position on the crest no sooner perceived their advance upon the summit of the pass than they themselves set off full tilt in a rival race for the summit too. Hoarse were the shouts of the Hellenic troops as the men cheered their companions forwards, and hoarse the answering shouts from the troops of Tissaphernes, urging on theirs. Xenophon, mounted on his charger, rode beside his men, and roused their ardour the while. \"Now for it, brave sirs; bethink you that this race is for Hellas!--now or never!--to find your boys, your wives; one small effort, and the rest of the march we shall pursue in peace, without ever a blow to strike; now for it.\" But Soteridas the Sicyonian said: \"We are not on equal terms, Xenophon; you are mounted 47 on a horse; I can hardly get along with my shield to carry;\" and he, on hearing the reproach, leapt from his horse. In another instant he had pushed Soteridas from the ranks, snatched from him his shield, and begun marching as quickly as he might under the circumstances, having his horseman's cuirass to carry as well, so that he was sore pressed; but he continued to cheer on the troops: exhorting those in front to lead on and the men toiling behind to follow up. Soteridas was not spared by the rest of the men. They gave him blows, they pelted him, they showered him with abuse, till they compelled him to take back his shield and march on; and the other, remounting, led them on horseback as long as the footing held; but when the ground became too steep, he left his horse and pressed forward on foot, and so they found themselves on the summit before the enemy.\n\n Some MSS. \"and the men behind to pass him by, as he could but ill keep up the pace.\"\n\nV\n\nThere and then the barbarians turned and fled as best they might, and 1 the Hellenes held the summit, while the troops with Tissaphernes and Ariaeus turned aside and disappeared by another road. The main body with Cheirisophus made its way down into the plain and encamped in a village filled with good things of divers sorts. Nor did this village stand alone; there were others not a few in this plain of the Tigris equally overflowing with plenty. It was now afternoon; and all of a sudden the enemy came in sight on the plain, and succeeded in cutting down some of the Hellenes belonging to parties who were scattered over the flat land in quest of spoil. Indeed, many herds of cattle had been caught whilst being conveyed across to the other side of the river. And now Tissaphernes and his troops made an attempt to burn the villages, and some of the Hellenes were disposed to take the matter deeply to heart, being apprehensive that they might not know where to get provisions if the enemy burnt the villages.\n\nCheirisophus and his men were returning from their sally of defence when Xenophon and his party descended, and the latter rode along the 4 ranks as the rescuing party came up, and greeted them thus: \"Do you not see, men of Hellas, they admit that the country is now ours; what they stipulated against our doing when they made the treaty, viz. that we were not to fire the king's country, they are now themselves doing--setting fire to it as if it were not their own. But we will be even with them; if they leave provisions for themselves anywhere, there also shall they see us marching;\" and, turning to Cheirisophus, he added: \"But it strikes me, we should sally forth against these incendiaries and protect our country.\" Cheirisophus retorted: \"That is not quite my view; I say, let us do a little burning ourselves, and they will cease all the quicker.\"\n\nWhen they had got back to the villages, while the rest were busy about provisions, the generals and officers met: and here there was deep despondency. For on the one side were exceedingly high mountains; on the other a river of such depth that they failed to reach the bottom with their spears. In the midst of their perplexities, a Rhodian came up with a proposal, as follows: \"I am ready, sirs to carry you across, four thousand heavy infantry at a time; if you will furnish me with what I need and give me a talent into the bargain for my pains.\" When asked, \"What shall you need?\" he replied: \"Two thousand wine-skins. I see there are plenty of sheep and goats and asses. They have only to be flayed, and their skins inflated, and they will readily give us a passage. I shall want also the straps which you use for the baggage animals. With these I shall couple the skins to one another; then I shall moor each skin by attaching stones and letting them down like anchors into the water. Then I shall carry them across, and when I have fastened the links at both ends, I shall place layers of wood on them and a coating of earth on the top of that. You will see in a minute that there's no danger of your drowning, for every skin will be able to support a couple of men without sinking, and the wood and earth will prevent your slipping off.\"\n\nThe generals thought it a pretty invention enough, but its realisation impracticable, for on the other side were masses of cavalry posted and ready to bar the passage; who, to begin with, would not suffer the 12 first detachment of crossers to carry out any item of the programme.\n\nUnder these circumstances, the next day they turned right about face, and began retracing their steps in the direction of Babylon to the unburnt villages, having previously set fire to those they left, so that the enemy did not ride up to them, but stood and stared, all agape to see in what direction the Hellenes would betake themselves and what they were minded to do. Here, again, while the rest of the soldiers were busy about provisions, the generals and officers met in council, and after collecting the prisoners together, submitted them to a cross-examination touching the whole country round, the names, and so forth, of each district.\n\nThe prisoners informed them that the regions south, through which they had come, belonged to the district towards Babylon and Media; the road east led to Susa and Ecbatana, where the king is said to spend summer and spring; crossing the river, the road west led to Lydia and Ionia; and the part through the mountains facing towards the Great Bear, led, they said, to the Carduchians. They were a people, so said the prisoners, dwelling up on the hills, addicted to war, and not subject to the king; so much so that once, when a royal army one hundred and twenty thousand strong had invaded them, not a man came back, owing to the intricacies of the country. Occasionally, however, they made truce or treaty with the satrap in the plain, and, for the nonce, there would be intercourse: \"they will come in and out amongst us,\" \"and we will go in and out amongst them,\" said the captives.\n\n See Dr. Kiepert, \"Man. Anc. Geog. (Mr. G. A. Macmillan) iv. 47. The Karduchians or Kurds belong by speech to the Iranian stock, forming in fact their farthest outpost to the west, little given to agriculture, but chiefly to the breeding of cattle. Their name, pronounced Kardu by the ancient Syrians and Assyrians, Kordu by the Armenians (plural Kordukh), first appears in its narrower sense in western literature in the pages of the eye-witness Xenophon as {Kardoukhoi}. Later writers knew of a small kingdom here at the time of the Roman occupation, ruled by native princes, who after Tigranes II (about 80 B.C.) recognised the overlordship of the Armenian king. Later it became a province of the Sassanid kingdom, and as such was in 297 A.D. handed over among the regiones transtigritanae to the Roman empire, but in 364 was again ceded to Persia.\n\nAfter hearing these statements, the generals seated apart those who 17 claimed to have any special knowledge of the country in any direction; they put them to sit apart without making it clear which particular route they intended to take. Finally the resolution to which they came was that they must force a passage through the hills into the territory of the Kurds; since, according to what their informants told them, when they had once passed these, they would find themselves in Armenia--the rich and large territory governed by Orontas; and from Armenia, it would be easy to proceed in any direction whatever. Thereupon they offered sacrifice, so as to be ready to start on the march as soon as the right moment appeared to have arrived. Their chief fear was that the high pass over the mountains must be occupied in advance: and a general order was issued, that after supper every one should get his kit together for starting, and repose, in readiness to follow as soon as the word of command was given.\nBOOK IV\n\n\n\nI\n\nIt was now about the last watch, and enough of the night remained to 1 allow them to cross the valley under cover of darkness; when, at the word of command, they rose and set off on their march, reaching the mountains at daybreak. At this stage of the march Cheirisophus, at the head of his own division, with the whole of the light troops, led the van, while Xenophon followed behind with the heavy infantry of the rearguard, but without any light troops, since there seemed to be no danger of pursuit or attack from the rear, while they were making their way up hill. Cheirisophus reached the summit without any of the 6 enemy perceiving him. Then he led on slowly, and the rest of the army followed, wave upon wave, cresting the summit and descending into the villages which nestled in the hollows and recesses of the hills.\n\nThereupon the Carduchians abandoned their dwelling places, and with their wives and children fled to the mountains; so there was plenty of provisions to be got for the mere trouble of taking, and the homesteads too were well supplied with a copious store of bronze vessels and utensils which the Hellenes kept their hands off, abstaining at the same time from all pursuit of the folk themselves, gently handling them, in hopes that the Carduchians might be willing to give them friendly passage through their country, since they too were enemies of the king: only they helped themselves to such provisions as fell in their way, which indeed was a sheer necessity. But the Carduchians neither gave ear, when they called to them, nor showed any other friendly sign; and now, as the last of the Hellenes descended into the villages from the pass, they were already in the dark, since, owing to the narrowness of the road, the whole day had been spent in the ascent and descent. At that instant a party of the Carduchians, who had collected, made an attack on the hindmost men, killing some and wounding others with stones and arrows--though it was quite a small body who attacked. The fact was, the approach of the Hellenic army had taken them by surprise; if, however, they had mustered in larger force at this time, the chances are that a large portion of the army would have been annihilated. As it was, they got into quarters, and bivouacked in the villages that night, while the Carduchians kept many watch-fires blazing in a circle on the mountains, and kept each other in sight all round.\n\nBut with the dawn the generals and officers of the Hellenes met and resolved to proceed, taking only the necessary number of stout baggage animals, and leaving the weaklings behind. They resolved further to let go free all the lately-captured slaves in the host; for the pace of the march was necessarily rendered slow by the quantity of animals and prisoners, and the number of non-combatants in attendance on these 13 was excessive, while, with such a crowd of human beings to satisfy, twice the amount of provisions had to be procured and carried. These resolutions passed, they caused a proclamation by herald to be made for their enforcement.\n\nWhen they had breakfasted and the march recommenced, the generals planted themselves a little to one side in a narrow place, and when they found any of the aforesaid slaves or other property still retained, they confiscated them. The soldiers yielded obedience, except where some smuggler, prompted by desire of a good-looking boy or woman, managed to make off with his prize. During this day they contrived to get along after a fashion, now fighting and now resting. But on the next day they were visited by a great storm, in spite of which they were obliged to continue the march, owing to insufficiency of provisions. Cheirisophus was as usual leading in front, while Xenophon headed the rearguard, when the enemy began a violent and sustained attack. At one narrow place after another they came up quite close, pouring in volleys of arrows and slingstones, so that the Hellenes had no choice but to make sallies in pursuit and then again recoil, making but very little progress. Over and over again Xenophon would send an order to the front to slacken pace, when the enemy were pressing their attack severely. As a rule, when the word was so passed up, Cheirisophus slackened; but sometimes instead of slackening, Cheirisophus quickened, sending down a counter-order to the rear to follow on quickly. It was clear that there was something or other happening, but there was no time to go to the front and discover the cause of the hurry. Under the circumstances the march, at any rate in the rear, became very like a rout, and here a brave man lost his life, Cleonymus the Laconian, shot with an arrow in the ribs right through shield and corselet, as also Basias, an Arcadian, shot clean through the head.\n\nAs soon as they reached a halting-place, Xenophon, without more ado, came up to Cheirisophus, and took him to task for not having waited, \"whereby,\" he said, \"we were forced to fight and flee at the same 19 moment; and now it has cost us the lives of two fine fellows; they are dead, and we were not able to pick up their bodies or bury them.\" Cheirisophus answered: \"Look up there,\" pointing as he spoke to the mountain, \"do you see how inaccessible it all is? only this one road, which you see, going straight up, and on it all that crowd of men who have seized and are guarding the single exit. That is why I hastened on, and why I could not wait for you, hoping to be beforehand with them yonder in seizing the pass: the guides we have got say there is no other way.\" And Xenophon replied: \"But I have got two prisoners also; the enemy annoyed us so much that we laid an ambuscade for them, which also gave us time to recover our breaths; we killed some of them, and did our best to catch one or two alive--for this very reason--that we might have guides who knew the country, to depend upon.\"\n\nThe two were brought up at once and questioned separately: \"Did they know of any other road than the one visible?\" The first said no; and in spite of all sorts of terrors applied to extract a better answer--\"no,\" he persisted. When nothing could be got out of him, he was killed before the eyes of his fellow. This latter then explained: \"Yonder man said, he did not know, because he has got a daughter married to a husband in those parts. I can take you,\" he added, \"by a good road, practicable even for beasts.\" And when asked whether there was any point on it difficult to pass, he replied that there was a col which it would be impossible to pass unless it were occupied in advance.\n\nThen it was resolved to summon the officers of the light infantry and some of those of the heavy infantry, and to acquaint them with the state of affairs, and ask them whether any of them were minded to distinguish themselves, and would step forward as volunteers on an expedition. Two or three heavy infantry soldiers stepped forward at once--two Arcadians, Aristonymus of Methydrium, and Agasias of Stymphalus--and in emulation of these, a third, also an Arcadian, Callimachus from Parrhasia, who said he was ready to go, and would get volunteers from the whole army to join him. \"I know,\" he added, \"there 27 will be no lack of youngsters to follow where I lead.\" After that they asked, \"Were there any captains of light infantry willing to accompany the expedition?\" Aristeas, a Chian, who on several occasions proved his usefulness to the army on such service, volunteered.\n\nII\n\nIt was already late afternoon, when they ordered the storming party to 1 take a snatch of food and set off; then they bound the guide and handed him over to them. The agreement was, that if they succeeded in taking the summit they were to guard the position that night, and at daybreak to give a signal by bugle. At this signal the party on the summit were to attack the enemy in occupation of the visible pass, while the generals with the main body would bring up their succours; making their way up with what speed they might. With this understanding, off they set, two thousand strong; and there was a heavy downpour of rain, but Xenophon, with his rearguard, began advancing to the visible pass, so that the enemy might fix his attention on this road, and the party creeping round might, as much as possible, elude observation. Now when the rearguard, so advancing, had reached a ravine which they must cross in order to strike up the steep, at that instant the barbarians began rolling down great boulders, each a wagon load, some larger, some smaller; against the rocks they crashed and splintered flying like slingstones in every direction--so that it was absolutely out of the question even to approach the entrance of the pass. Some of the officers finding themselves baulked at this point, kept trying other ways, nor did they desist till darkness set in; and then, when they thought they would not be seen retiring, they returned to supper. Some of them who had been on duty in the rearguard had had no breakfast (it so happened). However, the enemy never ceased rolling down their stones all through the night, as was easy to infer from the booming sound.\n\n I.e. several ton weight.\n\nThe party with the guide made a circuit and surprised the enemy's guards seated round their fire, and after killing some, and driving out the rest, took their places, thinking that they were in possession of the height. As a matter of fact they were not, for above them lay a 6 breast-like hill skirted by the narrow road on which they had found the guards seated. Still, from the spot in question there was an approach to the enemy, who were seated on the pass before mentioned.\n\n Or, \"mamelon.\"\n\nHere then they passed the night, but at the first glimpse of dawn they marched stealthily and in battle order against the enemy. There was a mist, so that they could get quite close without being observed. But as soon as they caught sight of one another, the trumpet sounded, and with a loud cheer they rushed upon the fellows, who did not wait their coming, but left the road and made off; with the loss of only a few lives however, so nimble were they. Cheirisophus and his men, catching the sound of the bugle, charged up by the well-marked road, while others of the generals pushed their way up by pathless routes, where each division chanced to be; the men mounting as they were best able, and hoisting one another up by means of their spears; and these were the first to unite with the party who had already taken the position by storm. Xenophon, with the rearguard, followed the path which the party with the guide had taken, since it was easiest for the beasts of burthen; one half of his men he had posted in rear of the baggage animals; the other half he had with himself. In their course they encountered a crest above the road, occupied by the enemy, whom they must either dislodge or be themselves cut off from the rest of the Hellenes. The men by themselves could have taken the same route as the rest, but the baggage animals could not mount by any other way than this.\n\nHere then, with shouts of encouragement to each other, they dashed at the hill with their storming columns, not from all sides, but leaving an avenue of escape for the enemy, if he chose to avail himself of it. For a while, as the men scrambled up where each best could, the natives kept up a fire of arrows and darts, yet did not receive them at close quarters, but presently left the position in flight. No sooner, however, were the Hellenes safely past this crest, than they came in sight of another in front of them, also occupied, and deemed it advisable to storm it also. But now it struck Xenophon that if they 13 left the ridge just taken unprotected in their rear, the enemy might re-occupy it and attack the baggage animals as they filed past, presenting a long extended line owing to the narrowness of the road by which they made their way. To obviate this, he left some officers in charge of the ridge--Cephisodorus, son of Cephisophon, an Athenian; Amphicrates, the son of Amphidemus, an Athenian; and Archagoras, an Argive exile--while he in person with the rest of the men attacked the second ridge; this they took in the same fashion, only to find that they had still a third knoll left, far the steepest of the three. This was none other than the mamelon mentioned as above the outpost, which had been captured over their fire by the volunteer storming party in the night. But when the Hellenes were close, the natives, to the astonishment of all, without a struggle deserted the knoll. It was conjectured that they had left their position from fear of being encircled and besieged, but the fact was that they, from their higher ground, had been able to see what was going on in the rear, and had all made off in this fashion to attack the rearguard.\n\nSo then Xenophon, with the youngest men, scaled up to the top, leaving orders to the rest to march on slowly, so as to allow the hindmost companies to unite with them; they were to advance by the road, and when they reached the level to ground arms. Meanwhile the Argive Archagoras arrived, in full flight, with the announcement that they had been dislodged from the first ridge, and that Cephisodorus and Amphicrates were slain, with a number of others besides, all in fact who had not jumped down the crags and so reached the rearguard. After this achievement the barbarians came to a crest facing the mamelon, and Xenophon held a colloquy with them by means of an interpreter, to negotiate a truce, and demanded back the dead bodies. These they agreed to restore if he would not burn their houses, and to these terms Xenophon agreed. Meanwhile, as the rest of the army filed past, and the colloquy was proceeding, all the people of the place had time to gather gradually, and the enemy formed; and as soon as the Hellenes began to descend from the mamelon to join the others where the troops were halted, on rushed the foe, in full force, with hue and cry. They 20 reached the summit of the mamelon from which Xenophon was descending, and began rolling down crags. One man's leg was crushed to pieces. Xenophon was left by his shield-bearer, who carried off his shield, but Eurylochus of Lusia, an Arcadian hoplite, ran up to him, and threw his shield in front to protect both of them; so the two together beat a retreat, and so too the rest, and joined the serried ranks of the main body.\n\n To take up position.\n\n I.e. of Lusi (or Lusia), a town (or district) in Northern Arcadia.\n\nAfter this the whole Hellenic force united, and took up their quarters there in numerous beautiful dwellings, with an ample store of provisions, for there was wine so plentiful that they had it in cemented cisterns. Xenophon and Cheirisophus arranged to recover the dead, and in return restored the guide; afterwards they did everything for the dead, according to the means at their disposal, with the customary honours paid to good men.\n\nNext day they set off without a guide; and the enemy, by keeping up a continuous battle and occupying in advance every narrow place, obstructed passage after passage. Accordingly, whenever the van was obstructed, Xenophon, from behind, made a dash up the hills and broke the barricade, and freed the vanguard by endeavouring to get above the obstructing enemy. Whenever the rear was the point attacked, Cheirisophus, in the same way, made a detour, and by endeavouring to mount higher than the barricaders, freed the passage for the rear rank; and in this way, turn and turn about, they rescued each other, and paid unflinching attention to their mutual needs. At times it happened that, the relief party having mounted, encountered considerable annoyance in their descent from the barbarians, who were so agile that they allowed them to come up quite close, before they turned back, and still escaped, partly no doubt because the only weapons they had to carry were bows and slings.\n\nThey were, moreover, excellent archers, using bows nearly three cubits long and arrows more than two cubits. When discharging the arrow, they draw the string by getting a purchase with the left foot planted 28 forward on the lower end of the bow. The arrows pierced through shield and cuirass, and the Hellenes, when they got hold of them, used them as javelins, fitting them to their thongs. In these districts the Cretans were highly serviceable. They were under the command of Stratocles, a Cretan.\n\nIII\n\nDuring this day they bivouacked in the villages which lie above the 1 plain of the river Centrites, which is about two hundred feet broad. It is the frontier river between Armenia and the country of the Carduchians. Here the Hellenes recruited themselves, and the sight of the plain filled them with joy, for the river was but six or seven furlongs distant from the mountains of the Carduchians. For the moment then they bivouacked right happily; they had their provisions, they had also many memories of the labours that were now passed; seeing that the last seven days spent in traversing the country of the Carduchians had been one long continuous battle, which had cost them more suffering than the whole of their troubles at the hands of the king and Tissaphernes put together. As though they were truly quit of them for ever, they laid their heads to rest in sweet content.\n\n I.e. the Eastern Tigris.\n\nBut with the morrow's dawn they espied horsemen at a certain point across the river, armed cap-a-pie, as if they meant to dispute the passage. Infantry, too, drawn up in line upon the banks above the cavalry, threatened to prevent them debouchng into Armenia. These troops were Armenian and Mardian and Chaldaean mercenaries belonging to Orontas and Artuchas. The last of the three, the Chaldaeans, were said to be a free and brave set of people. They were armed with long wicker shields and lances. The banks before named on which they were drawn up were a hundred yards or more distant from the river, and the single road which was visible was one leading upwards and looking like a regular artificially constructed highway. At this point the Hellenes endeavoured to cross, but on their making the attempt the water proved 6 to be more than breast-deep, and the river bed was rough with great slippery stones, and as to holding their arms in the water, it was out of the question--the stream swept them away--or if they tried to carry them over the head, the body was left exposed to the arrows and other missiles; accordingly they turned back and encamped there by the bank of the river.\n\nAt the point where they had themselves been last night, up on the mountains, they could see the Carduchians collected in large numbers and under arms. A shadow of deep despair again descended on their souls, whichever way they turned their eyes--in front lay the river so difficult to ford; over, on the other side, a new enemy threatening to bar the passage; on the hills behind, the Carduchians ready to fall upon their rear should they once again attempt to cross. Thus for this day and night they halted, sunk in perplexity. But Xenophon had a dream. In his sleep he thought that he was bound in fetters, but these, of their own accord, fell from off him, so that he was loosed, and could stretch his legs as freely as he wished. So at the first glimpse of daylight he came to Cheirisophus and told him that he had hopes that all things would go well, and related to him his dream.\n\n It is impossible to give the true sense and humour of the passage in English, depending, as it does, on the double meaning of {diabainein} (1) to cross (a river), (2) to stride or straddle (of the legs). The army is unable to cross the Centrites; Xenophon dreams that he is fettered, but the chains drop off his legs and he is able to stride as freely as ever; next morning the two young men come to him with the story how they have found themselves able to walk cross the river instead of having to swim it. It is obvious to Xenophon that the dream is sent from Heaven.\n\nThe other was well pleased, and with the first faint gleam of dawn the generals all were present and did sacrifice; and the victims were favourable in the first essay. Retiring from the sacrifice, the generals and officers issued an order to the troops to take their breakfasts; and while Xenophon was taking his, two young men came running up to him, for every one knew that, breakfasting or supping, he was always accessible, or that even if asleep any one was welcome to awaken him who had anything to say bearing on the business of war. 10 What the two young men had at this time to say was that they had been collecting brushwood for fire, and had presently espied on the opposite side, in among some rocks which came down to the river's brink, an old man and some women and little girls depositing, as it would appear, bags of clothes in a cavernous rock. When they saw them, it struck them that it was safe to cross; in any case the enemy's cavalry could not approach at this point. So they stripped naked, expecting to have to swim for it, and with their long knives in their hands began crossing, but going forward crossed without being wet up to the fork. Once across they captured the clothes, and came back again.\n\nAccordingly Xenophon at once poured out a libation himself, and bade the two young fellows fill the cup and pray to the gods, who showed to him this vision and to them a passage, to bring all other blessings for them to accomplishment. When he had poured out the libation, he at once led the two young men to Cheirisophus, and they repeated to him their story. Cheirisophus, on hearing it, offered libations also, and when they had performed them, they sent a general order to the troops to pack up ready for starting, while they themselves called a meeting of the generals and took counsel how they might best effect a passage, so as to overpower the enemy in front without suffering any loss from the men behind. And they resolved that Cheirisophus should lead the van and cross with half the army, the other half still remaining behind under Xenophon, while the baggage animals and the mob of sutlers were to cross between the two divisions.\n\nWhen all was duly ordered the move began, the young men pioneering them, and keeping the river on their left. It was about four furlongs' march to the crossing, and as they moved along the bank, the squadrons of cavalry kept pace with them on the opposite side.\n\nBut when they had reached a point in a line with the ford, and the cliff-like banks of the river, they grounded arms, and first Cheirisophus himself placed a wreath upon his brows, and throwing off 17 his cloak, resumed his arms, passing the order to all the rest to do the same, and bade the captains form their companies in open order in deep columns, some to left and some to right of himself. Meanwhile the soothsayers were slaying a victim over the river, and the enemy were letting fly their arrows and slingstones; but as yet they were out of range. As soon as the victims were favourable, all the soldiers began singing the battle hymn, and with the notes of the paean mingled the shouting of the men accompanied by the shriller chant of the women, for there were many women in the camp.\n\n Or, \"having doffed it,\" i.e. the wreath, an action which the soldiers would perform symbolically, if Grote is right in his interpretation of the passage, \"Hist. of Greece,\" vol. ix. p. 137.\n\n Lit. \"comrade-women.\"\n\nSo Cheirisophus with his detachment stepped in. But Xenophon, taking the most active-bodied of the rearguard, began running back at full speed to the passage facing the egress into the hills of Armenia, making a feint of crossing at that point to intercept their cavalry on the river bank. The enemy, seeing Cheirisophus's detachment easily crossing the stream, and Xenophon's men racing back, were seized with the fear of being intercepted, and fled at full speed in the direction of the road which emerges from the stream. But when they were come opposite to it they raced up hill towards their mountains. Then Lycius, who commanded the cavalry, and Aeschines, who was in command of the division of light infantry attached to Cheirisophus, no sooner saw them fleeing so lustily than they were after them, and the soldiers shouted not to fall behind, but to follow them right up to the mountains. Cheirisophus, on getting across, forbore to pursue the cavalry, but advanced by the bluffs which reached to the river to attack the enemy overhead. And these, seeing their own cavalry fleeing, seeing also the heavy infantry advancing upon them, abandoned the heights above the river.\n\n Or, \"to stick tight to them and not to be outdone\"; or, as others understand, \"the (infantry) soldiers clamoured not to be left behind, but to follow them up into the mountains.\"\n\nXenophon, as soon as he saw that things were going well on the other 24 side, fell back with all speed to join the troops engaged in crossing, for by this time the Carduchians were well in sight, descending into the plain to attack their rear.\n\nCheirisophus was in possession of the higher ground, and Lycius, with his little squadron, in an attempt to follow up the pursuit, had captured some stragglers of their baggage-bearers, and with them some handsome apparel and drinking-cups. The baggage animals of the Hellenes and the mob of non-combatants were just about to cross, when Xenonphon turned his troops right about to face the Carduchians. Vis-a-vis he formed his line, passing the order to the captains each to form his company into sections, and to deploy them into line by the left, the captains of companies and lieutenants in command of sections to advance to meet the Carduchians, while the rear leaders would keep their position facing the river. But when the Carduchians saw the rearguard so stript of the mass, and looking now like a mere handful of men, they advanced all the more quickly, singing certain songs the while. Then, as matters were safe with him, Cheirisophus sent back the peltasts and slingers and archers to join Xenophon, with orders to carry out his instructions. They were in the act of recrossing, when Xenophon, who saw their intention, sent a messenger across, bidding them wait there at the river's brink without crossing; but as soon as he and his detachment began to cross they were to step in facing him in two flanking divisions right and left of them, as if in the act of crossing; the javelin men with their javelins on the thong, and the bowmen with their arrows on the string; but they were not to advance far into the stream. The order passed to his own men was: \"Wait till you are within sling-shot, and the shield rattles, then sound the paean and charge the enemy. As soon as he turns, and the bugle from the river sounds for 'the attack,' you will face about to the right, the rear rank leading, and the whole detachment falling back and crossing the river as quickly as possible, every one preserving his original rank, so as to avoid tramelling one another: the bravest man is he who gets to the other side first.\"\n\nThe Carduchians, seeing that the remnant left was the merest handful 30 (for many even of those whose duty it was to remain had gone off in their anxiety to protect their beasts of burden, or their personal kit, or their mistresses), bore down upon them valorously, and opened fire with slingstones and arrows. But the Hellenes, raising the battle hymn, dashed at them at a run, and they did not await them; armed well enough for mountain warfare, and with a view to sudden attack followed by speedy flight, they were not by any means sufficiently equipped for an engagement at close quarters. At this instant the signal of the bugle was heard. Its notes added wings to the flight of the barbarians, but the Hellenes turned right about in the opposite direction, and betook themselves to the river with what speed they might. Some of the enemy, here a man and there another, perceived, and running back to the river, let fly their arrows and wounded a few; but the majority, even when the Hellenes were well across, were still to be seen pursuing their flight. The detachment which came to meet Xenophon's men, carried away by their valour, advanced further than they had need to, and had to cross back again in the rear of Xenophon's men, and of these too a few were wounded.\n\nIV\n\nThe passage effected, they fell into line about mid-day, and marched 1 through Armenian territory, one long plain with smooth rolling hillocks, not less than five parasangs in distance; for owing to the wars of this people with the Carduchians there were no villages near the river. The village eventually reached was large, and possessed a palace belonging to the satrap, and most of the houses were crowned with turrets; provisions were plentiful.\n\nFrom this village they marched two stages--ten parasangs--until they had surmounted the sources of the river Tigris; and from this point they marched three stages--fifteen parasangs--to the river Teleboas. This was a fine stream, though not large, and there were many villages about it. The district was named Western Armenia. The lieutenant-governor of it was Tiribazus, the king's friend, and whenever the latter paid a visit, he alone had the privilege of mounting the king upon his horse. This officer rode up to the Hellenes with a body of cavalry, and sending forward an interpreter, stated that he desired a colloquy with the leaders. The generals resolved to 5 hear what he had to say; and advancing on their side to within speaking distance, they demanded what he wanted. He replied that he wished to make a treaty with them, in accordance with which he on his side would abstain from injuring the Hellenes, if they would not burn his houses, but merely take such provisions as they needed. This proposal satisfied the generals, and a treaty was made on the terms suggested.\n\nFrom this place they marched three stages--fifteen parasangs--through plain country, Tiribazus the while keeping close behind with his own forces more than a mile off. Presently they reached a palace with villages clustered round about it, which were full of supplies in great variety. But while they were encamping in the night, there was a heavy fall of snow, and in the morning it was resolved to billet out the different regiments, with their generals, throughout the villages. There was no enemy in sight, and the proceeding seemed prudent, owing to the quantity of snow. In these quarters they had for provisions all the good things there are--sacrificial beasts, corn, old wines with an exquisite bouqet, dried grapes, and vegetables of all sorts. But some of the stragglers from the camp reported having seen an army, and the blaze of many watchfires in the night. Accordingly the generals concluded that it was not prudent to separate their quarters in this way, and a resolution was passed to bring the troops together again. After that they reunited, the more so that the weather promised to be fine with a clear sky; but while they lay there in open quarters, during the night down came so thick a fall of snow that it completely covered up the stacks of arms and the men themselves lying down. It cramped and crippled the baggage animals; and there was great unreadiness to get up, so gently fell the snow as they lay there warm and comfortable, and formed a blanket, except where it slipped off the sleepers' shoulders; and it was not until Xenophon roused himself to get up, and, without his cloak on, began to split wood, that quickly first one and then another got up, and taking the log away 12 from him, fell to splitting. Thereat the rest followed suit, got up, and began kindling fire and oiling their bodies, for there was a scented unguent to be found there in abundance, which they used instead of oil. It was made from pig's fat, sesame, bitter almonds, and turpentine. There was a sweet oil also to be found, made of the same ingredients.\n\n Or, as we should say, \"in his shirt sleeves.\" Doubtless he lay with his {imation} or cloak loosely wrapped round him; as he sprang to his feet he would throw it off, or it would fall off, and with the simple inner covering of the {khiton} to protect him, and arms free, he fell to chopping the wood, only half clad.\n\nAfter this it was resolved that they must again separate their quarters and get under cover in the villages. At this news the soldiers, with much joy and shouting, rushed upon the covered houses and the provisions; but all who in their blind folly had set fire to the houses when they left them before, now paid the penalty in the poor quarters they got. From this place one night they sent off a party under Democrates, a Temenite, up into the mountains, where the stragglers reported having seen watchfires. The leader selected was a man whose judgement might be depended upon to verify the truth of the matter. With a happy gift to distinguish between fact and fiction, he had often been successfully appealed to. He went and reported that he had seen no watchfires, but he had got a man, whom he brought back with him, carrying a Persian bow and quiver, and a sagaris or battleaxe like those worn by the Amazons. When asked \"from what country he came,\" the prisoner answered that he was \"a Persian, and was going from the army of Tiribazus to get provisions.\" They next asked him \"how large the army was, and for what object it had been collected.\" His answer was that \"it consisted of Tiribazus at the head of his own forces, and aided by some Chalybian and Taochian mercenaries. Tiribazus had got it together,\" he added, \"meaning to attack the Hellenes on the high mountain pass, in a defile which was the sole passage.\"\n\n Reading {Temeniten}, i.e. a native of Temenus, a district of Syracuse; al. {Temniten}, i.e. from Temnus in the Aeolid; al. {Temeniten}, i.e. from Temenum in the Argolid.\n\nWhen the generals heard this news, they resolved to collect the troops, and they set off at once, taking the prisoner to act as guide, and leaving a garrison behind with Sophaenetus the Stymphalian in 19 command of those who remained in the camp. As soon as they had begun to cross the hills, the light infantry, advancing in front and catching sight of the camp, did not wait for the heavy infantry, but with a loud shout rushed upon the enemy's entrenchment. The natives, hearing the din and clatter, did not care to stop, but took rapidly to their heels. But, for all their expedition, some of them were killed, and as many as twenty horses were captured, with the tent of Tiribazus, and its contents, silver-footed couches and goblets, besides certain persons styling themselves the butlers and bakers. As soon as the generals of the heavy infantry division had learnt the news, they resolved to return to the camp with all speed, for fear of an attack being made on the remnant left behind. The recall was sounded and the retreat commenced; the camp was reached the same day.\n\nV\n\nThe next day it was resolved that they should set off with all 1 possible speed, before the enemy had time to collect and occupy the defile. Having got their kit and baggage together, they at once began their march through deep snow with several guides, and, crossing the high pass the same day on which Tiribazus was to have attacked them, got safely into cantonments. From this point they marched three desert stages--fifteen parassangs--to the river Euphrates, and crossed it in water up to the waist. The sources of the river were reported to be at no great distance. From this place they marched through deep snow over a flat country three stages--fifteen parasangs. The last of these marches was trying, with the north wind blowing in their teeth, drying up everything and benumbing the men. Here one of the seers suggested to them to do sacrifice to Boreas, and sacrifice was done. The effect was obvious to all in the diminished fierceness of the blast. But there was six feet of snow, so that many of the baggage animals and slaves were lost, and about thirty of the men themselves.\n\n Al. \"ten,\" al. \"five.\"\n\nThey spent the whole night in kindling fire; for there was fortunately no dearth of wood at the halting-place; only those who came late into camp had no wood. Accordingly those who had arrived a good while and 5 had kindled fires were not for allowing these late-comers near the fires, unless they would in return give a share of their corn or of any other victuals they might have. Here then a general exchange of goods was set up. Where the fire was kindled the snow melted, and great trenches formed themselves down to the bare earth, and here it was possible to measure the depth of the snow.\n\nLeaving these quarters, they marched the whole of the next day over snow, and many of the men were afflicted with \"boulimia\" (or hunger-faintness). Xenophon, who was guarding the rear, came upon some men who had dropt down, and he did not know what ailed them; but some one who was experienced in such matters suggested to him that they had evidently got boulimia; and if they got something to eat, they would revive. Then he went the round of the baggage train, and laying an embargo on any eatables he could see, doled out with his own hands, or sent off other able-bodied agents to distribute to the sufferers, who as soon as they had taken a mouthful got on their legs again and continued the march.\n\nOn and on they marched, and about dusk Cheirisophus reached a village, and surprised some women and girls who had come from the village to fetch water at the fountain outside the stockade. These asked them who they were. The interpreters answered for them in Persian: \"They were on their way from the king to the satrap;\" in reply to which the women gave them to understand that the satrap was not at home, but was away a parasang farther on. As it was late they entered with the water-carriers within the stockade to visit the headman of the village. Accordingly Cheirisophus and as many of the troops as were able got into cantonments there, while the rest of the soldiers--those namely who were unable to complete the march--had to spend the night out, without food and without fire; under the circumstances some of the men perished.\n\nOn the heels of the army hung perpetually bands of the enemy, snatching away disabled baggage animals and fighting with each other over the carcases. And in its track not seldom were left to their fate disabled soldiers, struck down with snow-blindness or with toes 12 moritified by frostbite. As to the eyes, it was some alleviation against the snow to march with something black before them; for the feet, the only remedy was to keep in motion without stopping for an instant, and to loose the sandal at night. If they went to sleep with the sandals on, the thong worked into the feet, and the sandals were frozen fast to them. This was partly due to the fact that, since their old sandals had failed, they wore untanned brogues made of newly-flayed ox-hides. It was owing to some such dire necessity that a party of men fell out and were left behind, and seeing a black-looking patch of ground where the snow had evidently disappeared, they conjectured it must have been melted; and this was actually so, owing to a spring of some sort which was to be seen steaming up in a dell close by. To this they had turned aside and sat down, and were loth to go a step further. But Xenophon, with his rearguard, perceived them, and begged and implored them by all manner of means not to be left behind, telling them that the enemy were after them in large packs pursuing; and he ended by growing angry. They merely bade him put a knife to their throats; not one step farther would they stir. Then it seemed best to frighten the pursuing enemy if possible, and prevent their falling upon the invalids. It was already dusk, and the pursuers were advancing with much noise and hubbub, wrangling and disputing over their spoils. Then all of a sudden the rearguard, in the plenitude of health and strength, sprang up out of their lair and run upon the enemy, whilst those weary wights bawled out as loud as their sick throats could sound, and clashed their spears against their shields; and the enemy in terror hurled themselves through the snow into the dell, and not one of them ever uttered a sound again.\n\n Hug, after Rehdantz, would omit the words \"in the plenitude of health and strength.\"\n\n Or, \"the invalids.\"\n\nXenophon and his party, telling the sick folk that next day people would come for them, set off, and before they had gone half a mile they fell in with some soldiers who had laid down to rest on the snow with their cloaks wrapped round them, but never a guard was established, and they made them get up. Their explanation was that 19 those in front would not move on. Passing by this group he sent forward the strongest of his light infantry in advance, with orders to find out what the stoppage was. They reported that the whole army lay reposing in such fashion. That being so, Xenophon's men had nothing for it but to bivouac in the open air also, without fire and supperless, merely posting what pickets they could under the circumstances. But as soon as it drew towards day, Xenophon despatched the youngest of his men to the sick folk behind, with orders to make them get up and force them to proceed. Meanwhile Cheirisophus had sent some of his men quartered in the village to enquire how they fared in the rear; they were overjoyed to see them, and handed over the sick folk to them to carry into camp, while they themselves continued their march forward, and ere twenty furlongs were past reached the village in which Cheirisophus was quartered. As soon as the two divisions were met, the resolution was come to that it would be safe to billet the regiments throughout the villages; Cheirisophus remained where he was, while the rest drew lots for the villages in sight, and then, with their several detachments, marched off to their respective destinations.\n\nIt was here that Polycrates, an Athenian and captain of a company, asked for leave of absence--he wished to be off on a quest of his own; and putting himself at the head of the active men of the division, he ran to the village which had been allotted to Xenophon. He surprised within it the villagers with their headman, and seventeen young horses which were being reared as a tribute for the king, and, last of all, the headman's own daughter, a young bride only eight days wed. Her husband had gone off to chase hares, and so he escaped being taken with the other villagers. The houses were underground structures with an aperture like the mouth of a well by which to enter, but they were broad and spacious below. The entrance for the beasts of burden was dug out, but the human occupants descended by a ladder. In these dwellings were to be found goats and sheep and cattle, and cocks and hens, with their various progeny. The flocks and herds were all reared under cover upon green food. There were stores within of wheat and barley and vegetables, and wine made from barley in great big bowls; 26 the grains of barley malt lay floating in the beverage up to the lip of the vessel, and reeds lay in them, some longer, some shorter, without joints; when you were thirsty you must take one of these into your mouth, and suck. The beverage without admixture of water was very strong, and of a delicious flavour to certain palates, but the taste must be acquired.\n\nXenophon made the headman of the village his guest at supper, and bade him keep a good heart; so far from robbing him of his children, they would fill his house full of good things in return for what they took before they went away; only he must set them an example, and discover some blessing or other for the army, until they found themselves with another tribe. To this he readily assented, and with the utmost cordiality showed them the cellar where the wine was buried. For this night then, having taken up their several quarters as described, they slumbered in the midst of plenty, one and all, with the headman under watch and ward, and his children with him safe in sight.\n\nBut on the following day Xenophon took the headman and set off to Cheirisophus, making a round of the villages, and at each place turning in to visit the different parties. Everywhere alike he found them faring sumptuously and merry-making. There was not a single village where they did not insist on setting a breakfast before them, and on the same table were spread half a dozen dishes at least, lamb, kid, pork, veal, fowls, with various sorts of bread, some of wheat and some of barley. When, as an act of courtesy, any one wished to drink his neighbour's health, he would drag him to the big bowl, and when there, he must duck his head and take a long pull, drinking like an ox. The headman, they insisted everywere, must accept as a present whatever he liked to have. But he would accept nothing, except where he espied any of his relations, when he made a point of taking them off, him or her, with himself.\n\nWhen they reached Cheirisophus they found a similar scene. There too 33 the men were feasting in their quarters, garlanded with whisps of hay and dry grass, and Armenian boys were playing the part of waiters in barbaric costumes, only they had to point out by gesture to the boys what they were to do, like deaf and dumb. After the first formalities, when Cheirisophus and Xenophon had greeted one another like bosom friends, they interrogated the headman in common by means of the Persian-speaking interpreter. \"What was the country?\" they asked: he replied, \"Armenia.\" And again, \"For whom are the horses being bred?\" \"They are tribute for the king,\" he replied. \"And the neighbouring country?\" \"Is the land of the Chalybes,\" he said; and he described the road which led to it. So for the present Xenophon went off, taking the headman back with him to his household and friends. He also made him a present of an oldish horse which he had got; he had heard that the headman was a priest of the sun, and so he could fatten up the beast and sacrifice him; otherwise he was afraid it might die outright, for it had been injured by the long marching. For himself he took his pick of the colts, and gave a colt apiece to each of his fellow-generals and officers. The horses here were smaller than the Persian horses, but much more spirited. It was here too that their friend the headman explained to them, how they should wrap small bags or sacks around the feet of the horses and other cattle when marching through the snow, for without such precautions the creatures sank up to their bellies.\n\nVI\n\nWhen a week had passed, on the eighth day Xenophon delivered over the 1 guide (that is to say, the village headman) to Cheirisophus. He left the headman's household safe behind in the village, with the exception of his son, a lad in the bloom of youth. This boy was entrusted to Episthenes of Amphipolis to guard; if the headman proved himself a good guide, he was to take away his son also at his departure. They finally made his house the repository of all the good things they could contrive to get together; then they broke up their camp and commenced to march, the headman guiding them through the snow unfettered. When they had reached the third stage Cheirisophus flew 2 into a rage with him, because he had not brought them to any villages. The headman pleaded that there were none in this part. Cheirisophus struck him, but forgot to bind him, and the end of it was that the headman ran away in the night and was gone, leaving his son behind him. This was the sole ground of difference between Cheirisophus and Xenophon during the march, this combination of ill-treatment and neglect in the case of the guide. As to the boy, Episthenes conceived a passion for him, and took him home with him, and found in him the most faithful of friends.\n\nAfter this they marched seven stages at the rate of five parasangs a day, to the banks of the river Phasis, which is a hundred feet broad: and thence they marched another couple of stages, ten parasangs; but at the pass leading down into the plain there appeared in front of them a mixed body of Chalybes and Taochians and Phasianians. When Cheirisophus caught sight of the enemy on the pass at a distance of about three or four miles, he ceased marching, not caring to approach the enemy with his troops in column, and he passed down the order to the others: to deploy their companies to the front, that the troops might form into line. As soon as the rearguard had come up, he assembled the generals and officers, and addressed them: \"The enemy, as you see, are in occupation of the mountain pass, it is time we should consider how we are to make the best fight to win it. My opinion is, that we should give orders to the troops to take their morning meal, whilst we deliberate whether we should cross the mountains to-day or to-morrow.\" \"My opinion,\" said Cleanor, \"is, that as soon as we have breakfasted, we should arm for the fight and attack the enemy, without loss of time, for if we fritter away to-day, the enemy who are now content to look at us, will grow bolder, and with their growing courage, depend upon it, others more numerous will join them.\"\n\n Probably a tributary of the Araxes = modern Pasin-Su.\n\nAfter him Xenophon spoke: \"This,\" he said, \"is how I see the matter; if fight we must, let us make preparation to sell our lives dearly, but if we desire to cross with the greatest ease, the point to consider is, how we may get the fewest wounds and throw away the smallest number of good men. Well then, that part of the mountain 11 which is visible stretches nearly seven miles. Where are the men posted to intercept us? except at the road itself, they are nowhere to be seen. It is much better to try if possible to steal a point of this desert mountain unobserved, and before they know where we are, secure the prize, than to fly at a strong position and an enemy thoroughly prepared. Since it is much easier to march up a mountain without fighting than to tramp along a level when assailants are at either hand; and provided he has not to fight, a man will see what lies at his feet much more plainly even at night than in broad daylight in the midst of battle; and a rough road to feet that roam in peace may be pleasanter than a smooth surface with the bullets whistling about your ears. Nor is it so impossible, I take it, to steal a march, since it is open to us to go by night, when we cannot be seen, and to fall back so far that they will never notice us. In my opinion, however, if we make a feint of attacking here, we shall find the mountain chain all the more deserted elsewhere, since the enemy will be waiting for us here in thicker swarm.\n\n Or, more lit., \"with the head a mark for missiles.\"\n\n\"But what right have I to be drawing conclusions about stealing in your presence, Cheirisophus? for you Lacedaemonians, as I have often been told, you who belong to the 'peers,' practise stealing from your boyhood up; and it is no disgrace but honourable rather to steal, except such things as the law forbids; and in order, I presume, to stimulate your sense of secretiveness, and to make you master thieves, it is lawful for you further to get a whipping if you are caught. Now then you have a fine opportunity of displaying your training. But take care we are not caught stealing over the mountain, or we shall catch it ourselves.\" \"For all that,\" retorted Cheirisophus, \"I have heard that you Athenians are clever hands at stealing the public moneys; and that too though there is a fearful risk for the person so employed; but, I am told, it is your best men who are addicted to it; if it is your best men who are thought worthy to rule. So it is a fine opportunity for yourself also, Xenophon, to exhibit your education.\" 17 \"And I,\" replied Xenophon, \"am ready to take the rear division, as soon as we have supped, and seize the mountain chain. I have already got guides, for the light troops laid an ambuscade, and seized some of the cut-purse vagabonds who hung on our rear. I am further informed by them that the mountain is not inaccessible, but is grazed by goats and cattle, so that if we can once get hold of any portion of it, there will be no difficulty as regards our animals--they can cross. As to the enemy, I expect they will not even wait for us any longer, when they once see us on a level with themselves on the heights, for they do not even at present care to come down and meet us on fair ground.\" Cheirisophus answered: \"But why should you go and leave your command in the rear? Send others rather, unless a band of volunteers will present themselves.\" Thereupon Aristonymus the Methydrian came forward with some heavy infantry, and Nicomachus the Oetean with another body of light troops, and they made an agreement to kindle several watch-fires as soon as they held the heights. The arrangements made, they breakfasted; and after breakfast Cheirisophus advanced the whole army ten furlongs closer towards the enemy, so as to strengthen the impression that he intended to attack them at that point.\n\nBut as soon as they had supped and night had fallen, the party under orders set off and occupied the mountain, while the main body rested where they were. Now as soon as the enemy perceived that the mountain was taken, they banished all thought of sleep, and kept many watch-fires blazing throughout the night. But at break of day Cheirisophus offered sacrifice, and began advancing along the road, while the detachment which held the mountain advanced pari passu by the high ground. The larger mass of the enemy, on his side, remained still on the mountain-pass, but a section of them turned to confront the detachment on the heights. Before the main bodies had time to draw together, the detachment on the height came to close quarters, and the Hellenes were victorious and gave chase. Meanwhile the light division of the Hellenes, issuing from the plain, were rapidly advancing against the serried lines of the enemy, whilst Cheirisophus followed up with his heavy infantry at quick march. But the enemy on the road 25 no sooner saw their higher division being worsted than they fled, and some few of them were slain, and a vast number of wicker shields were taken, which the Hellenes hacked to pieces with their short swords and rendered useless. So when they had reached the summit of the pass, they sacrificed and set up a trophy, and descending into the plain, reached villages abounding in good things of every kind.\n\nVII\n\nAfter this they marched into the country of the Taochians five 1 stages--thirty parasangs--and provisions failed; for the Taochians lived in strong places, into which they had carried up all their stores. Now when the army arrived before one of these strong places--a mere fortress, without city or houses, into which a motley crowd of men and women and numerous flocks and herds were gathered--Cheirisophus attacked at once. When the first regiment fell back tired, a second advanced, and again a third, for it was impossible to surround the place in full force, as it was encircled by a river. Presently Xenophon came up with the rearguard, consisting of both light and heavy infantry, whereupon Cheirisophus halted him with the words: \"In the nick of time you have come; we must take this place, for the troops have no provisions, unless we take it.\" Thereupon they consulted together, and to Xenophon's inquiry, \"What it was which hindered their simply walking in?\" Cheirisophus replied, \"There is just this one narrow approach which you see, but when we attempt to pass it by they roll down volleys of stones from yonder overhanging crag,\" pointing up, \"and this is the state in which you find yourself, if you chance to be caught;\" and he pointed to some poor fellows with their legs or ribs crushed to bits. \"But when they have expended their ammunition,\" said Xenophon, \"there is nothing else, is there, to hinder our passing? Certainly, except yonder handful of fellows, there is no one in front of us that we can see; and of them, only two or three apparently are armed, and the distance to be traversed under fire is, as your eyes will tell you, about one hundred and fifty feet as near as can be, and of this space the first hundred is thickly covered with great pines at intervals; under cover of these, what harm can come to our men from a pelt of stones, flying 6 or rolling? So then, there is only fifty feet left to cross, during a lull of stones.\" \"Ay,\" said Cheirisophus, \"but with our first attempt to approach the bush a galling fire of stones commences.\" \"The very thing we want,\" said the other, \"for they will use up their ammunition all the quicker; but let us select a point from which we shall have only a brief space to run across, if we can, and from which it will be easier to get back, if we wish.\"\n\nThereupon Cheirisophus and Xenophon set out with Callimachus the Parrhasian, the captain in command of the officers of the rearguard that day; the rest of the captains remained out of danger. That done, the next step was for a party of about seventy men to get away under the trees, not in a body, but one by one, every one using his best precaution; and Agasis the Stymphalian, and Aristonymous the Methydrian, who were also officers of the rearguard, were posted as supports outside the trees; for it was not possible for more than a single company to stand safely within the trees. Here Callimachus hit upon a pretty contrivance--he ran forward from the tree under which he was posted two or three paces, and as soon as the stones came whizzing, he retired easily, but at each excursion more than ten wagon-loads of rocks were expended. Agasias, seeing how Callimachus was amusing himself, and the whole army looking on as spectators, was seized with the fear that he might miss his chance of being first to run the gauntlet of the enemy's fire and get into the place. So, without a word of summons to his neighbour, Aristonymous, or to Eurylochus of Lusia, both comrades of his, or to any one else, off he set on his own account, and passed the whole detachment. But Callimachus, seeing him tearing past, caught hold of his shield by the rim, and in the meantime Aristonymous the Methydrian ran past both, and after him Eurylochus of Lusia; for they were one and all aspirants to valour, and in that high pursuit, each was the eager rival of the rest. So in this strife of honour, the three of them took the fortress, and when they had once rushed in, not a stone more was hurled from overhead.\n\nAnd here a terrible spectacle displayed itself: the women first cast their infants down the cliff, and then they cast themselves after 13 their fallen little ones, and the men likewise. In such a scene, Aeneas the Stymphalian, an officer, caught sight of a man with a fine dress about to throw himself over, and seized hold of him to stop him; but the other caught him to his arms, and both were gone in an instant headlong down the crags, and were killed. Out of this place the merest handful of human beings were taken prisoners, but cattle and asses in abundance and flocks of sheep.\n\nFrom this place they marched through the Chalybes seven stages, fifty parasangs. These were the bravest men whom they encountered on the whole march, coming cheerily to close quarters with them. They wore linen cuirasses reaching to the groin, and instead of the ordinary \"wings\" or basques, a thickly-plaited fringe of cords. They were also provided with greaves and helmets, and at the girdle a short sabre, about as long as the Laconian dagger, with which they cut the throats of those they mastered, and after severing the head from the trunk they would march along carrying it, singing and dancing, when they drew within their enemy's field of view. They carried also a spear fifteen cubits long, lanced at one end. This folk stayed in regular townships, and whenever the Hellenes passed by they invariably hung close on their heels fighting. They had dwelling-places in their fortresses, and into them they had carried up their supplies, sot hat the Hellenes could get nothing from this district, but supported themselves on the flocks and herds they had taken from the Taochians. After this the Hellenes reached the river Harpasus, which was four hundred feet broad. Hence they marched through the Scythenians four stages--twenty parasangs--through a long level country to more villages, among which they halted three days, and got in supplies.\n\n These are the Armeno-Chalybes, so called by Pliny in contradistinction to another mountain tribe in Pontus so named, who were famous for their forging, and from whom steel received its Greek name {khalups}. With these latter we shall make acquaintance later on.\n\n I.e. with a single point or spike only, the Hellenic spear having a spike at the butt end also.\n\nPassing on from thence in four stages of twenty parasangs, they 19 reached a large and prosperous well-populated city, which went by the name of Gymnias, from which the governor of the country sent them a guide to lead them through a district hostile to his own. This guide told them that within five days he would lead them to a place from which they would see the sea, \"and,\" he added, \"if I fail of my word, you are free to take my life.\" Accordingly he put himself at their head; but he no sooner set foot in the country hostile to himself than he fell to encouraging them to burn and harry the land; indeed his exhortations were so earnest, it was plain that it was for this he had come, and not out of the good-will he bore the Hellenes.\n\n Gymnias is supposed (by Grote, \"Hist. of Greece,\" vol. ix. p. 161) to be the same as that which is now called Gumisch-Kana--perhaps \"at no great distance from Baibut,\" Tozer, \"Turkish Armenia,\" p. 432. Others have identified it with Erzeroum, others with Ispir.\n\nOn the fifth day they reached the mountain, the name of which was Theches. No sooner had the men in front ascended it and caught sight of the sea than a great cry arose, and Xenophon, in the rearguard, catching the sound of it, conjectured that another set of enemies must surely be attacking in front; for they were followed by the inhabitants of the country, which was all aflame; indeed the rearguard had killed some and captured others alive by laying an ambuscade; they had taken also about twenty wicker shields, covered with the raw hides of shaggy oxen.\n\n Some MSS. give \"the sacred mountain.\" The height in question has been identified with \"the ridge called Tekieh-Dagh to the east of Gumisch-Kana, nearer to the sea than that place\" (Grote, ib. p. 162), but the exact place from which they caught sight of the sea has not been identified as yet, and other mountain ranges have been suggested.\n\nBut as the shout became louder and nearer, and those who from time to time came up, began racing at the top of their speed towards the shouters, and the shouting continually recommenced with yet greater volume as the numbers increased, Xenophon settled in his mind that something extraordinary must have happened, so he mounted his horse, and taking with him Lycius and the cavalry, he galloped to the rescue. Presently they could hear the soldiers shouting and passing on the joyful word, \"The sea! the sea!\"\n\nThereupon they began running, rearguard and all, and the baggage 24 animals and horses came galloping up. But when they had reached the summit, then indeed they fell to embracing one another--generals and officers and all--and the tears trickled down their cheeks. And on a sudden, some one, whoever it was, having passed down the order, the soldiers began bringing stones and erecting a great cairn, whereon they dedicated a host of untanned skins, and staves, and captured wicker shields, and with his own hand the guide hacked the shields to pieces, inviting the rest to follow his example. After this the Hellenes dismissed the guide with a present raised from the common store, to wit, a horse, a silver bowl, a Persian dress, and ten darics; but what he most begged to have were their rings, and of these he got several from the soldiers. So, after pointing out to them a village where they would find quarters, and the road by which they would proceed towards the land of the Macrones, as evening fell, he turned his back upon them in the night and was gone.\n\nVIII\n\nFrom this point the Hellenes marched through the country of the 1 Macrones three stages--ten parasangs, and on the first day they reached the river, which formed the boundary between the land of the Macrones and the land of the Scythenians. Above them, on their right, they had a country of the sternest and ruggedest character, and on their left another river, into which the frontier river discharges itself, and which they must cross. This was thickly fringed with trees which, though not of any great bulk, were closely packed. As soon as they came up to them, the Hellenes proceeded to cut them down in their haste to get out of the place as soon as possible. But the Macrones, armed with wicker shields and lances and hair tunics, were already drawn up to receive them opposite the crossing. They were cheering one another on, and kept up a steady pelt of stones into the river, though they failed to reach the other side or do any harm.\n\nAt this juncture one of the light infantry came up to Xenophon; he had been, he said, a slave at Athens, and he wished to tell him that he recognised the speech of these people. \"I think,\" said he, \"that this must be my native country, and if there is no objection I will have a talk with them.\" \"No objection at all,\" replied Xenophon, \"pray talk 5 to them, and ask them first, who they are.\" In answer to this question they said, \"they were Macrones.\" \"Well, then,\" said he, \"ask them why they are drawn up in battle and want to fight with us.\" They answered, \"Because you are invading our country.\" The generals bade him say: \"If so, it is with not intention certainly of doing it or you any harm: but we have been at war with the king, and are now returning to Hellas, and all we want is to reach the sea.\" The others asked, \"Were they willing to give them pledges to that effect?\" They replied: \"Yes, they were ready to give and receive pledges to that effect.\" Then the Macrones gave a barbaric lance to the Hellenes, and the Hellenes a Hellenic lance to them: \"for these,\" they said, \"would serve as pledges,\" and both sides called upon the gods to witness.\n\nAfter the pledges were exchanged, the Macrones fell to vigorously hewing down trees and constructing a road to help them across, mingling freely with the Hellenes and fraternising in their midst, and they afforded them as good as market as they could, and for three days conducted them on their march, until they had brought them safely to the confines of the Colchians. At this point they were confronted by a great mountain chain, which however was accessible, and on it the Colchians were drawn up for battle. In the first instance, the Hellenes drew up opposite in line of battle, as though they were minded to assault the hill in that order; but afterwards the generals determined to hold a council of war, and consider how to make the fairest fight.\n\nAccordingly Xenophon said: \"I am not for advancing in line, but advise to form companies by columns. To begin with, the line,\" he urged, \"would be scattered and thrown into disorder at once; for we shall find the mountain full of inequalities, it will be pathless here and easy to traverse there. The mere fact of first having formed in line, and then seeing the line thrown into disorder, must exercise a disheartening effect. Again, if we advance several deep, the enemy will none the less overlap us, and turn their superfluous numbers to account as best they like; while, if we march in shallow order, we may fully expect our line to be cut through and through by the thick rain 11 of missiles and rush of men, and if this happen anywhere along the line, the whole line will equally suffer. No; my notion is to form columns by companies, covering ground sufficient with spaces between the companies to allow the last companies of each flank to be outside the enemy's flanks. Thus we shall with our extreme companies be outside the enemy's line, and the best men at the head of their columns will lead the attack, and every company will pick its way where the ground is easy; also it will be difficult for the enemy to force his way into the intervening spaces, when there are companies on both sides; nor will it be easy for him to cut in twain any individual company marching in column. If, too, any particular company should be pressed, the neighbouring company will come to the rescue, or if at any point any single company succeed in reaching the height, from that moment not one man of the enemy will stand his ground.\"\n\nThis proposal was carried, and they formed into columns by companies. Then Xenophon, returning from the right wing to the left, addressed the soldiers. \"Men,\" he said, \"these men whom you see in front of you are the sole obstacles still interposed between us and the haven of our hopes so long deferred. We will swallow them up whole, without cooking, if we can.\"\n\n For this formation, see \"The Retreat of the Ten Thousand; a military study for all time,\" by Lieut.-General J. L. Vaughan, C.B.\n\n Or, \"we will gobble them up raw.\" He is thinking of the Homeric line (\"Iliad\", iv. 35) \"Perchance wert thou to enter within the gates and long walls and devour Priam raw, and Priam's sons and all the Trojans, then mightest thou assuage thine anger.\"--Leaf.\n\nThe several divisions fell into position, the companies were formed into columns, and the result was a total of something like eighty companies of heavy infantry, each company consisting on an average of a hundred men. The light infantry and bowmen were arranged in three divisions--two outside to support the left and the right respectively, and the third in the centre--each division consisting of about six hundred men.\n\n This suggests 1800 as the total of the peltasts, 8000 as the total of the hoplites, but the companies were probably not limited to 100, and under \"peltasts\" were probably included other light troops.\n\nBefore starting, the generals passed the order to offer prayer; and 16 with the prayer and battle hymn rising from their lips they commenced their advance. Cheirisophus and Xenophon, and the light infantry with them, advanced outside the enemy's line to right and left, and the enemy, seeing their advance, made an effort to keep parallel and confront them, but in order to do so, as he extended partly to right and partly to left, he was pulled to pieces, and there was a large space or hollow left in the centre of his line. Seeing them separate thus, the light infantry attached to the Arcadian battalion, under command of Aeschines, an Arcarnanian, mistook the movement for flight, and with a loud shout rushed on, and these were the first to scale the mountain summit; but they were closely followed up by the Arcadian heavy infantry, under command of Cleanor of Orchomenus.\n\nWhen they began running in that way, the enemy stood their ground no longer, but betook themselves to flight, one in one direction, one in another, and the Hellenes scaled the hill and found quarters in numerous villages which contained supplies in abundance. Here, generally speaking, there was nothing to excite their wonderment, but the numbers of bee-hives were indeed astonishing, and so were certain properties of the honey. The effect upon the soldiers who tasted the combs was, that they all went for the nonce quite off their heads, and suffered from vomiting and diarrhoea, with a total inability to stand steady on their legs. A small dose produced a condition not unlike violent drunkenness, a large one an attack very like a fit of madness, and some dropped down, apparently at death's door. So they lay, hundreds of them, as if there had been a great defeat, a prey to the cruellest despondency. But the next day, none had died; and almost at the same hour of the day at which they had eaten they recovered their senses, and on the third or fourth day got on their legs again like convalescents after a severe course of medical treatment.\n\n \"Modern travellers attest the existence, in these regions, of honey intoxicating and poisonous. . . . They point out the Azalea Pontica as the flower from which the bees imbibe this peculiar quality.\"--Grote, \"Hist. of Greece,\" vol. ix. p. 155.\n\nFrom this place they marched on two stages--seven parasangs--and 22 reached the sea at Trapezus, a populous Hellenic city on the Euxine Sea, a colony of the Sinopeans, in the territory of the Colchians. Here they halted about thirty days in the villages of the Colchians, which they used as a base of operations to ravage the whole territory of Colchis. The men of Trapezus supplied the army with a market, entertained them, and gave them, as gifts of hospitality, oxen and wheat and wine. Further, they negotiated with them in behalf of their neighbours the Colchians, who dwelt in the plain for the most part, and from this folk also came gifts of hospitality in the shape of cattle. And now the Hellenes made preparation for the sacrifice which they had vowed, and a sufficient number of cattle came in for them to offer thank-offerings for safe guidance to Zeus the Saviour, and to Heracles, and to the other gods, according to their vows. They instituted also a gymnastic contest on the mountain side, just where they were quartered, and chose Dracontius, a Spartan (who had been banished from home when a lad, having unintentionally slain another boy with a blow of his dagger), to superintend the course, and be president of the games\n\n Trebizond.\n\n Or, \"to sacrifice to Zeus the Preserver, and to Heracles thank-offerings for safe guidance,\" Heracles \"the conductor\" having special sympathy with wanderers.\n\nAs soon as the sacrifices were over, they handed over the hides of the beasts to Dracontius, and bade him lead the way to his racecourse. He merely waved his hand and pointed to where they were standing, and said, \"There, this ridge is just the place for running, anywhere, everywhere.\" \"But how,\" it was asked, \"will they manage to wrestle on the hard scrubby ground?\" \"Oh! worse knocks for those who are thrown,\" the president replied. There was a mile race for boys, the majority being captive lads; and for the long race more than sixty Cretans competed; there was wrestling, boxing, and the pankration. Altogether it was a beautiful spectacle. There was a large number of entries, and the emulation, with their companions, male and female, 27 standing as spectators, was immense. There was horse-racing also; the riders had to gallop down a steep incline to the sea, and then turn and come up again to the altar, and on the descent more than half rolled head over heels, and then back they came toiling up the tremendous steep, scarcely out of a walking pace. Loud were the shouts, the laughter, and the cheers.\n\n The pankration combined both wrestling and boxing.\n\n\nBOOK V\n\n\n\nI\n\nAfter this they met and took counsel concerning the remainder of the 1 march. The first speaker was Antileon of Thurii. He rose and said: \"For my part, sirs, I am weary by this time of getting kit together and packing up for a start, of walking and running and carrying heavy arms, and of tramping along in line, or mounting guard, and doing battle. The sole desire I now have is to cease from all these pains, and for the future, since here we have the sea before us, to sail on and on, 'stretched out in sleep,' like Odysseus, and so to find myself in Hellas.\" When they heard these remarks, the soldiers showed their approval with loud cries of \"well said,\" and then another spoke to the same effect, and then another, and indeed all present. Then Cheirisophus got up and said: \"I have a friend, sirs, who, as good hap will have it, is now high admiral, Anaxibius. If you like to send me to him, I think I can safely promise to return with some men-of-war and other vessels which will carry us. All you have to do, if you are really minded to go home by sea, is to wait here till I come. I will be back ere long.\" The soldiers were delighted at these words, and 4 voted that Cheirisophus should set sail on his mission without delay.\n\nAfter him, Xenophon got up, and spoke as follows: \"Cheirisophus, it is agreed, sets out in search of vessels, and we are going to await him. Let me tell you what, in my opinion, it is reasonable to do while we are waiting. First of all, we must provide ourselves with necessaries from hostile territory, for there is not a sufficient market, nor, if there were, have we, with a few solitary exceptions, the means of purchase. Now, the district is hostile, so that if you set off in search of provisions without care and precaution, the chances are that many of us will be lost. To meet this risk, I propose that we should organise foraging parties to capture provisions, and, for the rest, not roam about the country at random. The organisation of the matter should be left to us.\" (The resolution was passed.) \"Please listen to another proposal;\" he continued: \"Some of you, no doubt, will be going out to pillage. It will be best, I think, that whoever does so should in each case before starting inform us of his intent, and in what direction he means to go, so that we may know the exact number of those who are out and of those who stop behind. Thus we shall be able to help in preparing and starting the expedition where necessary; and in case of aid or reinforcements being called for, we shall know in what direction to proceed; or, again, if the attempt is to be undertaken by raw or less expert hands, we may throw in the weight of our experience and advice by endeavouring to discover the strength of those whom they design to attack.\" This proposal was also carried. \"Here is another point,\" he continued, \"to which I would draw your attention. Our enemies will not lack leisure to make raids upon us: nor is it unnatural, that they should lay plots for us; for we have appropriated what is theirs; they are seated over us ever on the watch. I propose then that we should have regular outposts round the camp. If we take it in succession to do picket and outlook duty, the enemy will be less able to harry us. And here is another point for your observation; supposing we knew for certain that Cheirisophus must return with a sufficient number of vessels, there would be no need of 10 the remark, but as that is still problematical, I propose that we should try to get together vessels on the spot also. If he comes and finds us already provided for here, we shall have more ships than we need, that is all; while, if he fails to bring them, we shall have the local supply to fall back upon. I see ships sailing past perpetually, so we have only to ask the loan of some war-ships from the men of Trapezus, and we can bring them into port, and safeguard them with their rudders unshipped, until we have enough to carry us. By this course I think we shall not fail of finding the means of transport requisite.\" That resolution was also passed. He proceeded: \"Consider whether you think it equitable to support by means of a general fund the ships' companies which we so impress, while they wait here for our benefit, and to agree upon a fare, on the principle of repaying kindnesses in kind.\" That too was passed. \"Well then,\" said he, \"in case, after all, our endeavours should not be crowned with success, and we find that we have not vessels enough, I propose that we should enjoin on the cities along the seaboard the duty of constructing and putting in order the roads, which we hear are impassable. They will be only too glad to obey, no doubt, out of mere terror and their desire to be rid of us.\"\n\nThis last proposal was met by loud cries and protestations against the idea of going by land at all. So, perceiving their infatuation, he did not put the question to the vote, but eventually persuaded the cities voluntarily to construct roads by the suggestion, \"If you get your roads in good order, we shall all the sooner be gone.\" They further got a fifty-oared galley from the Trapezuntines, and gave the command of it to Dexippus, a Laconian, one of the perioeci. This man altogether neglected to collect vessels on the offing, but slunk off himself, and vanished, ship and all, out of Pontus. Later on, however, he paid the penalty of his misdeeds. He became involved in some meddling and making in Thrace at the court of Seuthes, and was put to death by the Laconian Nicander. They also got a thirty-oared galley, the command of which was entrusted to Polycrates, an Athenian, and 16 that officer brought into harbour to the camp all the vessels he could lay his hands on. If these were laden, they took out the freights and appointed guards to keep an eye on their preservation, whilst they used the ships themselves for transport service on the coast. While matters stood at this point, the Hellenes used to make forays with varying success; sometimes they captured prey and sometimes they failed. On one occasion Cleanetus led his own and another company against a strong position, and was killed himself, with many others of his party.\n\n A native of the country parts of Laconia.\n\nII\n\nThe time came when it was no longer possible to capture provisions, 1 going and returning to the camp in one day. In consequence of this, Xenophon took some guides from the Trapezuntines and led half the army out against the Drilae, leaving the other half to guard the camp. That was necessary, since the Colchians, who had been ousted from their houses, were assembled thickly, and sat eyeing them from the heights above; on the other hand the Trapezuntines, being friendly to the native inhabitants, were not for leading the Hellenes to places where it was easy to capture provisions. But against the Drilae, from whom they personally suffered, they would lead them with enthusiasm, up into mountainous and scarcely accessible fortresses, and against the most warlike people of any in the Pontus.\n\nBut when the Hellenes had reached the uplands, the Drilae set fire to all their fastnesses which they thought could be taken easily, and beat a retreat; and except here and there a stray pig or bullock or other animal which had escaped the fire there was nothing to capture; but there was one fastness which served as their metropolis: into this the different streams of people collected; round it ran a tremendously deep ravine, and the approaches to the place were difficult. So the light infantry ran forward five or six furlongs in advance of the heavy infantry, and crossed the ravine; and seeing quantities of sheep and other things, proceeded to attack the place. Close at their heels followed a number of those who had set out on the foray armed with spears, so that the storming party across the ravine amounted to more than two thousand. But, finding that they could not take the place by 5 a coup-de-main, as there was a trench running round it, mounded up some breadth, with a stockade on the top of the earthwork and a close-packed row of wooden bastions, they made an attempt to run back, but the enemy fell upon them from the rear. To get away by a sudden rush was out of the question, since the descent from the fortress into the ravine only admitted of moving in single file. Under the circumstances they sent to Xenophon, who was in command of the heavy infantry. The messenger came and delivered his message: \"There is a fastness choke full of all sorts of stores, but we cannot take it, it is too strong; nor can we easily get away; the enemy rush out and deliver battle, and the return is difficult.\"\n\nOn hearing this, Xenophon pushed forward his heavy infantry to the edge of the ravine, and there ordered them to take up a position, while he himself with the officers crossed over to determine whether it were better to withdraw the party already across, or to bring over the heavy infantry also, on the supposition that the fortress might be taken. In favour of the latter opinion it was agreed that the retreat must cost many lives, and the officers were further disposed to think, they could take the place. Xenophon consented, relying on the victims, for the seers had announced, that there would be a battle, but that the result of the expedition would be good. So he sent the officers to bring the heavy troops across, while he himself remained, having drawn off all the light infantry and forbidden all sharp-shooting at long range. As soon as the heavy infantry had arrived, he ordered each captain to form his company, in whatever way he hoped to make it most effective in the coming struggle. Side by side together they stood, these captains, not for the first time to-day competitors for the award of manly virtue. While they were thus employed, he--the general--was engaged in passing down his order along the ranks of the light infantry and archers respectively to march with the javelin on its thong and the arrow to the string, ready at the word \"shoot\" to discharge their missiles, while the light troops were to have their wallets well stocked with slingstones; lastly, he despatched his 12 adjutants to see to the proper carrying out of these orders.\n\nAnd now the preparations were complete: the officers and lieutenants and all others claiming to be peers of these, were drawn up in their several places. With a glance each was able to command the rest in the crescent-like disposition which the ground invited. Presently the notes of the battle hymn arose, the clarion spoke, and with a thrilling cry in honour of the warrior-god, commenced a rush of the heavy infantry at full speed under cover of a storm of missiles, lances, arrows, bullets, but most of all stones hurled from the hand with ceaseless pelt, while there were some who brought firebrands to bear. Overwhelmed by this crowd of missiles, the enemy left their stockades and their bastion towers, which gave Agasias the Stymphalian and Philoxenus of Pellene a chance not to be missed; laying aside their heavy arms, up they went in bare tunics only, and one hauled another up, and meantime another had mounted, and the place was taken, as they thought. Then the peltasts and light troops rushed in and began snatching what each man could. Xenophon the while, posted at the gates, kept back as many of the hoplites as he could, for there were other enemies now visible on certain strong citadel heights; and after a lapse of no long time a shout arose within, and the men came running back, some still clutching what they had seized; and presently here and there a wounded man; and mighty was the jostling about the portals. To the questions which were put to them the outpouring fugitives repeated the same story: there was a citadel within and enemies in crowds were making savage sallies and beating the fellows inside.\n\nAt that Xenophon ordered Tolmides the herald to proclaim: \"Enter all who are minded to capture aught.\" In poured the surging multitude, and the counter-current of persons elbowing their passage in prevailed over the stream of those who issued forth, until they beat back and cooped up the enemy within the citadel again. So outside the citadel everything was sacked and pillaged by the Hellenes, and the heavy infantry took up their position, some about the stockades, others 19 along the road leading up to the citadel. Xenophon and the officers meantime considered the possibility of taking the citadel, for if so, their safety was assured; but if otherwise, it would be very difficult to get away. As the result of their deliberations they agreed that the place was impregnable. Then they began making preparations for the retreat. Each set of men proceeded to pull down the palisading which faced themselves; further, they sent away all who were useless or who had enough to do to carry their burdens, with the mass of the heavy infantry accompanying them; the officers in each case leaving behind men whom they could severally depend on.\n\nBut as soon as they began to retreat, out rushed upon them from within a host of fellows, armed with wicker shields and lances, greaves and Paphlagonian helmets. Others might be seen scaling the houses on this side and that of the road leading into the citadel. Even pursuit in the direction of the citadel was dangerous, since the enemy kept hurling down on them great beams from above, so that to stop and to make off were alike dangerous, and night approaching was full of terrors. But in the midst of their fighting and their despair some god gave them a means of safety. All of a sudden, by whatsoever hand ignited, a flame shot up; it came from a house on the right hand, and as this gradually fell in, the people from the other houses on the right took to their heels and fled.\n\nXenophon, laying this lesson of fortune to heart, gave orders to set fire to the left-hand houses also, which being of wood burned quickly, with the result that the occupants of these also took to flight. The men immediately at their front were the sole annoyance now, and these were safe to fall upon them as they made their exit and in their descent. Here then the word was passed for all who were out of range to bring up logs of wood and pile them between themselves and the enemy, and when there was enough of these they set them on fire; they also fired the houses along the trench-work itself, so as to occupy the attention of the enemy. Thus they got off, though with difficulty, and escaped from the place by putting a fire between them and the 27 enemy; and the whole city was burnt down, houses, turrets, stockading, and everything belonging to it except the citadel.\n\nNext day the Hellenes were bent on getting back with the provisions; but as they dreaded the descent to Trapezus, which was precipitous and narrow, they laid a false ambuscade, and a Mysian, called after the name of his nation (Mysus), took ten of the Cretans and halted in some thick brushy ground, where he made a feint of endeavouring to escape the notice of the enemy. The glint of their light shields, which were of brass, now and again gleamed through the brushwood. The enemy, seeing it all through the thicket, were confirmed in their fears of an ambuscade. But the army meanwhile was quietly making its descent; and when it appeared that they had crept down far enough, the signal was given to the Mysian to flee as fast as he could, and he, springing up, fled with his men. The rest of the party, that is the Cretans, saying, \"We are caught if we race,\" left the road and plunged into a wood, and tumbling and rolling down the gullies were saved. The Mysian, fleeing along the road, kept crying for assistance, which they sent him, and picked him up wounded. The party of rescue now beat a retreat themselves with their face to the foe, exposed to a shower of missiles, to which some of the Cretan bowmen responded with their arrows. In this way they all reached the camp in safety.\n\n Lit. \"{Musos} (Mysus), a Mysian by birth, and {Musos} (Mysus) by name.\"\n\nIII\n\nNow when Cheirisophus did not arrive, and the supply of ships was 1 insufficient, and to get provisions longer was impossible, they resolved to depart. On board the vessels they embarked the sick, and those above forty years of age, with the boys and women, and all the baggage which the solders were not absolutely forced to take for their own use. The two eldest generals, Philesius and Sophaenetus, were put in charge, and so the party embarked, while the rest resumed their march, for the road was now completely constructed. Continuing their march that day and the next, on the third they reached Cerasus, a Hellenic city on the sea, and a colony of Sinope, in the country of the Colchians. Here they halted ten days, and there was a review and numbering of the troops under arms, when there were found to be eight 3 thousand six hundred men. So many had escaped; the rest had perished at the hands of the enemy, or by reason of the snow, or else disease.\n\nAt this time and place they divided the money accruing from the captives sold, and a tithe selected for Apollo and Artemis of the Ephesians was divided between the generals, each of whom took a portion to guard for the gods, Neon the Asinaean taking on behalf of Cheirisophus.\n\n I.e. of Asine, perhaps the place named in Thuc. iv. 13, 54; vi. 93 situated on the western side of the Messenian bay. Strabo, however, speaks of another Asine near Gytheum, but possibly means Las. See Arnold's note to Thuc. iv. 13, and Smith's \"Dict. Geog. (s.v.)\"\n\nOut of the portion which fell to Xenophon he caused a dedicatory ofering to Apollo to be made and dedicated among the treasures of the Athenians at Delphi. It was inscribed with his own name and that of Proxenus, his friend, who was killed with Clearchus. The gift for Artemis of the Ephesians was, in the first instance, left behind by him in Asia at the time when he left that part of the world himself with Agesilaus on the march into Boeotia. He left it behind in charge of Megabyzus, the sacristan of the goddess, thinking that the voyage on which he was starting was fraught with danger. In the event of his coming out of it alive, he charged Megabyzus to restore to him the deposit; but should any evil happen to him, then he was to cause to be made and to dedicate on his behalf to Artemis, whatsoever thing he thought would be pleasing to the goddess.\n\n Cf. Herod. i. 14; Strabo. ix. 420 for such private treasuries at Delphi.\n\n I.e. in the year B.C. 394. The circumstances under which Agesilaus was recalled from Asia, with the details of his march and the battle of Coronea, are described by Xenophon in the fourth book of the \"Hellenica.\"\n\nIn the days of his banishment, when Xenophon was now established by the Lacedaemonians as a colonist in Scillus, a place which lies on 7 the main road to Olympia, Megabyzus arrived on his way to Olympia as a spectator to attend the games, and restored to him the deposit. Xenophon took the money and bought for the goddess a plot of ground at a point indicated to him by the oracle. The plot, it so happened, had its own Selinus river flowing through it, just as at Ephesus the river Selinus flows past the temple of Artemis, and in both streams fish and mussels are to be found. On the estate at Scillus there is hunting and shooting of all the beasts of the chase that are.\n\n Scillus, a town of Triphylia, a district of Elis. In B.C. 572 the Eleians had razed Pisa and Scillus to the ground. But between B.C. 392 and 387 the Lacedaemonians, having previously (B.C. 400, \"Hell.\" III. ii. 30) compelled the Eleians to renounce their supremacy over their dependent cities, colonised Scillus and eventually gave it to Xenophon, then an exile from Athens. Xenophon resided here from fifteen to twenty years, but was, it is said, expelled from it by the Eleians soon after the battle of Leuctra, in B.C. 371.--\"Dict. Geog. (s.v.)\" The site of the place, and of Xenophon's temple, is supposed to be in the neighbourhood of the modern village of Chrestena, or possibly nearer Mazi. To reach Olympia, about 2 1/2 miles distant, one must cross the Alpheus.\n\nHere with the sacred money he built an altar and a temple, and ever after, year by year, tithed the fruits of the land in their season and did sacrifice to the goddess, while all the citizens and neighbours, men and women, shared in the festival. The goddess herself provided for the banqueters meat and loaves and wine and sweetmeats, with portions of the victims sacrificed from the sacred pasture, as also of those which were slain in the chase; for Xenophon's own lads, with the lads of the other citizens, always made a hunting excursion against the festival day, in which any grown men who liked might join. The game was captured partly from the sacred district itself, partly from Pholoe, pigs and gazelles and stags. The place lies on the direct road from Lacedaemon to Olympia, about twenty furlongs from the temple of Zeus in Olympia, and within the sacred enclosure there is meadow-land and wood-covered hills, suited to the breeding of pigs and goats and cattle and horses, so that even the sumpter animals of the pilgrims passing to the feast fare sumptuously. The shrine is girdled by a grove of cultivated trees, yielding dessert fruits in their season. The temple itself is a facsimile on a small scale of the great temple at Ephesus, and the image of the goddess is like the golden statue at Ephesus, save only that it is made, not of gold, but of cypress wood. Beside the temple stands a column bearing this inscription:-- THE PLACE IS SACRED TO ARTEMIS. HE WHO HOLDS IT AND ENJOYS THE FRUITS OF IT IS BOUND TO SACRIFICE YEARLY A TITHE OF THE 13 PRODUCE. AND FROM THE RESIDUE THEREOF TO KEEP IN REPAIR THE SHRINE. IF ANY MAN FAIL IN AUGHT OF THIS THE GODDESS HERSELF WILL LOOK TO IT THAT THE MATTER SHALL NOT SLEEP.\n\n Pholoe. This mountain (north of the Alpheus) is an offshoot of Erymanthus, crossing the Pisatis from east to west, and separating the waters of the Peneus and the Ladon from those of the Alpheus --\"Dict. Geog.\" (Elis).\n\nIV\n\nFrom Cerasus they continued the march, the same portion of the troops 1 being conveyed by sea as before, and the rest marching by land. When they had reached the frontiers of the Mossynoecians they sent to him Timesitheus the Trapezuntine, who was the proxenos of the Mossynoecians, to inquire whether they were to pass through their territory as friends or foes. They, trusting in their strongholds, replied that they would not give them passage. It was then that Timesitheus informed them that the Mossynoecians on the farther side of the country were hostile to these members of the tribe; and it was resolved to invite the former to make an alliance, if they wished it. So Timesitheus was sent, and came back with their chiefs. On their arrival there was a conference of the Mossynoecian chiefs and the generals of the Hellenes, and Xenophon made a speech which Timesitheus interpreted. He said: \"Men of the Mossynoecians, our desire is to reach Hellas in safety; and since we have no vessels we must needs go by foot, but these people who, as we hear, are your enemies, prevent us. Will you take us for your allies? Now is your chance to exact vengeance for any wrong, which they at any time may have put upon you, and for the future they will be your subjects; but if you send us about our business, consider and ask yourselves from what quarter will you ever again obtain so strong a force to help you?\" To this the chief of the Mossynoecians made answer:--that the proposal was in accordance with their wishes and they welcomed the alliance. \"Good,\" said Xenophon, \"but to what use do you propose to put us, if we become your allies? And what will you in turn be able to do to assist our passage?\" They replied: \"We can make an incursion into this country hostile to yourselves and us, from the opposite side, and also send 10 you ships and men to this place, who will aid you in fighting and conduct you on the road.\"\n\n I.e. dwellers in mossyns, or wooden towers. See Herod. iii. 94; vii. 78. Cf. also Strabo, xi. 41.\n\n Or, \"consul.\"\n\nOn this understanding, they exchanged pledges and were gone. The next day they returned, bringing three hundred canoes, each hollowed out of a single trunk. There were three men in each, two of whom disembarked and fell into rank, whilst the third remained. Then the one set took the boats and sailed back again, whilst the other two-thirds who remained marshalled themselves in the following way. They stood in rows of about a hundred each, like the rows of dancers in a chorus, standing vis-a-vis to one another, and all bearing wicker shields, made of white oxhide, shaggy, and shaped like an ivy leaf; in the right hand they brandished a javelin about six cubits long, with a lance in front, and rounded like a ball at the butt end of the shaft.\n\nTheir bodies were clad in short frocks, scarcely reaching to the knees and in texture closely resembling that of a linen bedclothes' bag; on their heads they wore leathern helmets just like the Paphlagonian helmet, with a tuft of hair in the middle, as like a tiara in shape as possible. They carried moreover iron battle-axes. Then one of them gave, as it were, the key-note and started, while the rest, taking up the strain and the step, followed singing and marking time. Passing through the various corps and heavy armed battalions of the Hellenes, they marched straight against the enemy, to what appeared the most assailable of his fortresses. It was situated in front of the city, or mother city, as it is called, which latter contains the high citadel of the Mossynoecians. This citadel was the real bone of contention, the occupants at any time being acknowledged as the masters of all the other Mossynoecians. The present holders (so it was explained) had no right to its possession; for the sake of self-aggrandisement they had seized what was really common property.\n\nSome of the Hellenes followed the attacking party, not under the orders of the generals, but for the sake of plunder. As they advanced, the enemy for a while kept quiet; but as they got near the place, they 16 made a sortie and routed them, killing several of the barbarians as well as some of the Hellenes who had gone up with them; and so pursued them until they saw the Hellenes advancing to the rescue. Then they turned round and made off, first cutting off the heads of the dead men and flaunting them in the face of the Hellenes and of their own private foes, dancing the while and singing in a measured strain. But the Hellenes were much vexed to think that their foes had only been rendered bolder, while the Hellenes who had formed part of the expedition had turned tail and fled, in spite of their numbers; a thing which had not happened previously during the whole expedition. So Xenophon called a meeting of the Hellenes and spoke as follows: \"Soldiers, do not in any wise be cast down by what has happened, be sure that good no less than evil will be the result; for to begin with, you now know certainly that those who are going to guide us are in very deed hostile to those with whom necessity drives us to quarrel; and, in the next place, some of our own body, these Hellenes who have made so light of orderly array and conjoint action with ourselves, as though they must needs achieve in the company of barbarians all they could with ourselves, have paid the penalty and been taught a lesson, so that another time they will be less prone to leave our ranks. But you must be prepared to show these friendly barbarians that you are of a better sort, and prove to the enemy that battle with the undisciplined is one thing, but with men like yourselves another.\"\n\nAccordingly they halted, as they were, that day. Next day they sacrificed and finding the victims favourable, they breakfasted, formed the companies into columns, and with their barbarians arranged in similar order on their left, began their march. Between the companies were the archers only slightly retired behind the front of the heavy infantry, on account of the enemy's active light troops, who ran down and kept up volleys of stones. These were held in check by the archers and peltasts; and steadily step by step the mass marched on, first to the position from which the barbarians and those with them had been driven two days back, and where the enemy were now drawn 23 up to meet them. Thus it came to pass that the barbarians first grappled with the peltasts and maintained the battle until the heavy infantry were close, when they turned and fled. The peltasts followed without delay, and pursued them right up to their city, while the heavy troops in unbroken order followed. As soon as they were up at the houses of the capital, there and then the enemy, collecting all together in one strong body, fought valiantly, and hurled their javelins, or else clenched their long stout spears, almost too heavy for a man to wield, and did their best to ward off the attack at close quarters.\n\nBut when the Hellenes, instead of giving way, kept massing together more thickly, the barbarians fled from this place also, and in a body deserted the fortress. Their king, who sat in his wooden tower or mossyn, built on the citadel (there he sits and there they maintain him, all at the common cost, and guard him narrowly), refused to come forth, as did also those in the fortress first taken, and so were burnt to a cinder where they were, their mossyns, themseves, and all. The Hellenes, pillaging and ransacking these places, discovered in the different houses treasures and magazines of loaves, pile upon pile, \"the ancestral stores,\" as the Mossynoecians told them; but the new corn was laid up apart with the straw-stalk and ear together, and this was for the most part spelt. Slices of dolphin were another discovery, in narrow-necked jars, all properly salted and pickled; and there was blubber of dolphin in vessels, which the Mossynoecians used precisely as the Hellenes use oil. Then there were large stores of nuts on the upper floor, the broad kind without a division. This was also a chief article of food with them--boiled nuts and baked loaves. Wine was also discovered. This, from its rough, dry quality, tasted sharp when drunk pure, but mixed with water was sweet and fragrant.\n\n I.e. \"chestnuts.\"\n\nThe Hellenes breakfasted and then started forward on their march, having first delivered the stronghold to their allies among the Mossynoecians. As for the other strongholds belonging to tribes allied with their foes, which they passed en route, the most accessible were either deserted by their inhabitants or gave in their adhesion 30 voluntarily. The following description will apply to the majority of them: the cities were on an average ten miles apart, some more, some less; but so elevated is the country and intersected by such deep clefts that if they chose to shout across to one another, their cries would be heard from one city to another. When, in the course of their march, they came upon a friendly population, these would entertain them with exhibitions of fatted children belonging to the wealthy classes, fed up on boiled chestnuts until they were as white as white can be, of skin plump and delicate, and very nearly as broad as they were long, with their backs variegated and their breasts tattooed with patterns of all sorts of flowers. They sought after the women in the Hellenic army, and would fain have laid with them openly in broad daylight, for that was their custom. The whole community, male and female alike, were fair-complexioned and white-skinned.\n\nIt was agreed that this was the most barbaric and outlandish people that they had passed through on the whole expedition, and the furthest removed from the Hellenic customs, doing in a crowd precisely what other people would prefer to do in solitude, and when alone behaving exactly as others would behave in company, talking to themselves and laughing at their own expense, standing still and then again capering about, wherever they might chance to be, without rhyme or reason, as if their sole business were to show off to the rest of the world.\n\nV\n\nThrough this country, friendly or hostile as the chance might be, the 1 Hellenes marched, eight stages in all, and reached the Chalybes. These were a people few in number, and subject to the Mossynoecians. Their livelihood was for the most part derived from mining and forging iron.\n\nThence they came to the Tibarenians. The country of the Tibarenians was far more level, and their fortresses lay on the seaboard and were less strong, whether by art or nature. The generals wanted to attack these places, so that the army might get some pickings, and they would not accept the gifts of hospitality which came in from the 2 Tibarenians, but bidding them wait till they had taken counsel, they proceeded to offer sacrifice. After several abortive attempts, the seers at last pronounced an opinion that the gods in no wise countenanced war. Then they accepted the gifts of hospitality, and marching through what was now recognised as a friendly country, in two days reached Cotyora, a Hellenic city, and a colony of Sinope, albeit situated in the territory of the Tibarenians.\n\n The MSS. here read, \"Up to this point the expedition was conducted on land, and the distance traversed on foot from the battle-field near Babylon down to Cotyora amounted to one hundred and twenty-two stages--that is to say, six hundred and twenty parasangs, or eighteen thousand stades, or if measured in time, an eight months' march.\" The words are probably the note of some editor or commentator, though it is quite likely that the author himself may have gone through such calculations and even have inserted them as a note to his text.\n\nHere they halted forty-five days, during which they first of all sacrificed to the gods, and instituted processions, each set of the Hellenes according to their several tribes, with gymnastic contests. Provisions they got in meanwhile, partly from Paphlagonia, partly from the estates of the Cotyorites, for the latter would neither provide them a market nor receive their sick within their walls.\n\nMeanwhile ambassadors arrived from Sinope, full of fears, not only for the Cotyorites and their city, which belonged to Sinope, and brought in tribute, but also for the territory which, as they had heard, was being pillaged. Accordingly they came to the camp and made a speech. Hecatonymus, who was reported to be a clever orator, acted as their spokesman: \"Soldiers,\" he said, \"the city of the Sinopeans has sent us to offer you, as Hellenes, our compliments and congratulations on your victories over the barbarians; and next, to express our joyful satisfaction that you have surmounted all those terrible sufferings of which we have heard, and have reached this place in safety. As Hellenes we claim to receive at your hands, as fellow-Hellenes, kindness and not harm. We have certainly not ourselves set you an example heretofore of evil treatment. Now the Cotyorites are our colonists. It was we who gave them this country to dwell in, having 10 taken it from the barbarians; for which reason also they, with the men of Cerasus and Trapezus, pay us an appointed tribute. So that, whatever mischief you inflict on the men of Cotyora, the city of Sinope takes as personal to herself. At the present time we hear that you have made forcible entry into their city, some of you, and are quartered in the houses, besides taking forcibly from the Cotyorite estates whatever you need, by hook and by crook. Now against these things we enter protest. If you mean to go on so doing, you will drive us to make friends with Corylas and the Paphlagonians, or any one else we can find.\"\n\nTo meet these charges Xenophon, on behalf of the soldiers, rose and said: \"As to ourselves, men of Sinope, having got so far, we are well content to have saved our bodies and our arms. Indeed it was impossible at one and the same moment to keep our enemies at bay and to despoil them of their goods and chattels. And now, since we have reached Hellenic cities, how has it fared with us? At Trapezus they gave us a market, and we paid for our provisions at a fair market price. In return for the honour they did us, and the gifts of hospitality they gave the army, we requited them with honour. Where the barbarian was friendly to them, we stayed our hands from injury; or under their escort, we did damage to their enemies to the utmost of our power. Ask them, what sort of people they found us. They are here, some of them, to answer for themselves. Their fellow-citizens and the state of Trapezus, for friendship's sake, have sent them with us to act as our guides.\n\n\"But wherever we come, be it foreign or Hellenic soil, and find no market for provisions, we are wont to help ourselves, not out of insolence but from necessity. There have been tribes like the Carduchians, the Taochians, the Chaldaeans, which, albeit they were not subject to the great king, yet were no less formidable than independent. These we had to bring over by our arms. The necessity of getting provisions forced us; since they refused to offer us a market. Whereas some other folk, like the Macrones, in spite of their being barbarians, we regarded as our friends, simply because they did provide us with the best market in their power, and we took no single 18 thing of theirs by force. But, to come to these Cotyorites, whom you claim to be your people, if we have taken aught from them, they have themselves to blame, for they did not deal with us as friends, but shut their gates in our faces. They would neither welcome us within nor furnish us with a market without. The only justification they alleged was that your governor had authorised this conduct.\n\n Lit. \"harmost\". The term, denoting properly a governor of the islands and foreign cities sent out by the Lacedaemonians during their supremacy, came, it would seem, to be adopted by other Greek communities under somewhat similar circumstances. Cotyora receives a harmost from her mother-city, Sinope. For the Greek colonies here mentioned, see Kiepert's \"Man. Anct. Geog.\" (Engl. tr., Mr. G. A. Macmillan), p. 63.\n\n\"As to your assertion,\" he continued, turning to Hecatonymus, \"that we have got in by force and have taken up quarters, this is what we did. We requested them to receive our sick and wounded under cover; and when they refused to open their gates, we walked in where the place itself invited us. All the violence we have committed amounts to this, that our sick folk are quartered under cover, paying for their expenses, and we keep a sentry at the gates, so that our sick and wounded may not lie at the mercy of your governor, but we may have it in our power to remove them whenever we like. The rest of us, you observe, are camping under the canopy of heaven, in regular rank and file, and we are ready to requite kindness with kindness, but to repel evil vigorously. And as for your threat,\" he said, once again turning to the spokesman, \"that you will, if it suits you, make alliance with Corylas and the Paphlagonians to attack us, for our part, we have no objection to fighting both sets of you, if so be we must; we have already fought others many times more numerous than you. Besides, 'if it suits us,' as you put it, to make the Paphlagonian our friend (report says that he has a hankering after your city and some other places on the seaboard), we can enhance the value of our friendship by helping to win for him what he covets.\"\n\nThereupon the ambassadors showed very plainly their annoyance with Hecatonymus, on account of the style of his remarks, and one of them stept forward to explain that their intention in coming was not at all to raise a war, but on the contrary to demonstrate their friendliness. 24 \"And if you come to Sinope itself,\" the speaker continued, \"we will welcome you there with gifts of hospitality. Meanwhile we will enjoin upon the citizens of this place to give you what they can; for we can see that every word of what you say is true.\" Thereupon the Cotyorites sent gifts of hospitality, and the generals of the Hellenes entertained the ambassadors of the Sinopeans. Many and friendly were the topics of conversation; freely flowed the talk on things in general; and, in particular, both parties were able to make inquiries and satisfy their curiosity concerning the remaining portion of the march.\n\nVI\n\nSuch was the conclusion of that day. On the following day the generals 1 summoned an assembly of the soldiers, when it was resolved to invite the men of Sinope, and to take advice with them touching the remainder of the journey. In the event of their having to continue it on foot, the Sinopeans through their acquaintance with Paphlagonia would be useful to them; while, if they had to go by sea, the services of the same people would be at a premium; for who but they could furnish ships sufficient for the army? Accordingly, they summoned their ambassadors, and took counsel with them, begging them, on the strength of the sacred ties which bind Hellenes to Hellenes, to inaugurate the good reception they had spoken of, by present kindliness and their best advice.\n\nHecatonymus rose and wished at once to offer an apology with regard to what he had said about the possibility of making friends with the Paphlagonians. \"The words were not intended,\" he said, \"to convey a threat, as though they were minded to go to war with the Hellenes, but as meaning rather: albeit we have it in our power to be friendly with the barbarians, we will choose the Hellenes.\" Then, being urged to aid them by some advice, with a pious ejaculation, he commenced: \"If I bestow upon you the best counsel I am able, God grant that blessings in abundance may descend on me; but if the contrary, may evil betide 4 me! 'Sacred counsel,' as the saying goes--well, sirs, if ever the saying held, it should hold I think to-day; when, if I be proved to have given you good counsel, I shall not lack panegyrists, or if evil, your imprecations will be many-tongued.\n\n Cf. Plato, \"Theages,\" 122.\n\n\"As to trouble, I am quite aware, we shall have much more trouble if you are conveyed by sea, for we must provide the vessels; whereas, if you go by land, all the fighting will evolve on you. Still, let come what may, it behoves me to state my views. I have an intimate acquaintance with the country of the Paphlagonians and their power. The country possesses the two features of hill and vale, that is to say, the fairest plains and the highest mountains. To begin with the mountains, I know the exact point at which you must make your entry. It is precisely where the horns of a mountain tower over both sides of the road. Let the merest handful of men occupy these and they can hold the pass with ease; for when that is done not all the enemies in the world could effect a passage. I could point out the whole with my finger, if you like to send any one with me to the scene.\n\n\"So much for the mountain barrier. But the next thing I know is that there are plains and a cavalry which the barbarians themselves hold to be superior to the entire cavalry of the great king. Why, only the other day these people refused to present themselves to the summons of the king; their chief is too proud for that.\n\n\"But now, supposing you were able to seize the mountain barrier, by stealth, or expedition, before the enemy could stop you; supposing further, you were able to win an engagement in the plain against not only their cavalry but their more than one hundred and twenty thousand infantry--you will only find yourself face to face with rivers, a series of them. First the Thermodon, three hundred feet broad, which I take it will be difficult to pass, especially with a host of foes in front and another following behind. Next comes the Iris river, three hundred feet broad; and thirdly, the Halys, at least two furlongs broad, which you could not possibly cross without vessels, and who is going to supply you with vessels? In the same way too the Parthenius 9 is impassable, which you will reach if you cross the Halys. For my part, then, I consider the land-journey, I will not say difficult, but absolutely impossible for you. Whereas if you go by sea, you can coast along from here to Sinope, and from Sinope to Heraclea. From Heraclea onwards there is no difficulty, whether by land or by sea; for there are plenty of vessels at Heraclea.\"\n\nAfter he had finished his remarks, some of his hearers thought they detected a certain bias in them. He would not have spoken so, but for his friendship with Corylas, whose official representative he was. Others guessed he had an itching palm, and that he was hoping to receive a present for his \"sacred advice.\" Others again suspected that his object was to prevent their going by foot and doing some mischief to the country of the Sinopeans. However that might be, the Hellenes voted in favour of continuing the journey by sea. After this Xenophon said: \"Sinopeans, the army has chosen that method of procedure which you advise, and thus the matter stands. If there are sure to be vessels enough to make it impossible for a single man to be left behind, go by sea we will; but if part of us are to be left while part go by sea, we will not set foot on board the vessels. One fact we plainly recognise, strength is everything to us. So long as we have the mastery, we shall be able to protect ourselves and get provisions; but if we are once caught at the mercy of our foes, it is plain, we shall be reduced to slavery.\" On hearing this the ambassadors bade them send an embassy, which they did, to wit, Callimachus the Arcadian, and Ariston the Athenian, and Samolas the Achaean.\n\nSo these set off, but meanwhile a thought shaped itself in the mind of Xenophon, as there before his eyes lay that vast army of Hellene hoplites, and that other array of peltasts, archers, and slingers, with cavalry to boot, and all in a state of thorough efficiency from long practice, hardened veterans, and all collected in Pontus, where to raise so large a force would cost a mint of money. Then the idea dawned upon him: how noble an opportunity to acquire new territory and 15 power for Hellas, by the founding of a colony--a city of no mean size, moreover, said he to himself, as he reckoned up their own numbers--and besides themselves a population planted on the shores of Pontus. Threupon he summoned Silanus the Ambraciot, the soothsayer of Cyrus above mentioned, and before breathing a syllable to any of the soldiers, he consulted the victims by sacrifice.\n\nBut Silanus, in apprehension lest these ideas might embody themselves, and the army be permanently halted at some point or other, set a tale going among the men, to the effect that Xenophon was minded to detain the army and found a city in order to win himself a name and acquire power, Silanus himself being minded to reach Hellas with all possible speed, for the simple reason that he had still got the three thousand darics presented to him by Cyrus on the occasion of the sacrifice when he hit the truth so happily about the ten days. Silanus's story was variously received, some few of the soldiers thinking it would be an excellent thing to stay in that country; but the majority were strongly averse. The next incident was that Timasion the Dardanian, with Thorax the Boeotian, addressed themselves to some Heracleot and Sinopean traders who had come to Cotyora, and told them that if they did not find means to furnish the army with pay sufficient to keep them in provisions on the homeward voyage, all that great force would most likely settle down permanently in Pontus. \"Xenophon has a pet idea,\" they continued, \"which he urges upon us. We are to wait until the ships come, and then we are suddenly to turn round to the army and say: 'Soldiers, we now see the straits we are in, unable to keep ourselves in provisions on the return voyage, or to make our friends at home a little present at the end of our journey. But if you like to select some place on the inhabited seaboard of the Black Sea which may take your fancy and there put in, this is open to you to do. Those who like to go home, go; those who care to stay here, stay. You have got 20 vessels now, so that you can make a sudden pounce upon any point you choose.'\"\n\nThe merchants went off with this tale and reported it to every city they came to in turn, nor did they go alone, but Timasion the Dardanian sent a fellow-citizen of his own, Eurymachus, with the Boeotian Thorax, to repeat the same story. So when it reached the ears of the men of Sinope and the Heracleots, they sent to Timasion and pressed him to accept of a gratuity, in return for which he was to arrange for the departure of the troops. Timasion was only too glad to hear this, and he took the opportunity when the soldiers were convened in meeting to make the following remarks: \"Soldiers,\" he said, \"do not set your thoughts on staying here; let Hellas, and Hellas only, be the object of your affection, for I am told that certain persons have been sacrificing on this very question, without saying a word to you. Now I can promise you, if you once leave these waters, to furnish you with regular monthly pay, dating from the first of the month, at the rate of one cyzicene a head per month. I will bring you to the Troad, from which part I am an exile, and my own state is at your service. They will receive me with open arms. I will be your guide personally, and I will take you to plces where you will get plenty of money. I know every corner of the Aeolid, and Phrygia, and the Troad, and indeed the whole satrapy of Pharnabazus, partly because it is my birthplace, partly from campaigns in that region with Clearchus and Dercylidas.\"\n\n A cyzicene stater = twenty-eight silver drachmae of Attic money B.C. 335, in the time of Demosthenes; but, like the daric, this gold coin would fluctuate in value relatively to silver. It contained more grains of gold than the daric.\n\n Of Dercylidas we hear more in the \"Hellenica.\" In B.C. 411 he was harmost at Abydos; in B.C. 399 he superseded Thimbron in Asia Minor; and was himself superseded by Agesilaus in B.C. 396.\n\nNo sooner had he ceased than up got Thorax the Boeotian. This was a man who had a standing battle with Xenophon about the generalship of the army. What he said was that, if they once got fairly out of the Euxine, there was the Chersonese, a beautiful and prosperous country, where they could settle or not, as they chose. Those who liked could stay; and those who liked could return to their homes; how ridiculous 25 then, when there was so much territory in Hellas and to spare, to be poking about in the land of the barbarian. \"But until you find yourselves there,\" he added, \"I, no less than Timasion, can guarantee you regular pay.\" This he said, knowing what promises had been made Timasion by the men of Heraclea and Sinope to induce them to set sail.\n\n The word {masteuein} occurs above, and again below, and in other writings of our author. It is probably Ionic or old Attic, and occurs in poetry.\n\nMeanwhile Xenophon held his peace. Then up got Philesius and Lycon, two Achaeans: \"It was monstrous,\" they said, \"that Xenophon should be privately persuading people to stop there, and consulting the victims for that end, without letting the army into the secret, or breathing a syllable in public about the matter.\" When it came to this, Xenophon was forced to get up, and speak as follows: \"Sirs, you are well aware that my habit is to sacrifice at all times; whether in your own behalf or my own, I strive in every thought, word, and deed to be directed as is best for yourselves and for me. And in the present instance my sole object was to learn whether it were better even so much as to broach the subject, and so take action, or to have absolutely nothing to do with the project. Now Silanus the soothsayer assured me by his answer of what was the main point: 'the victims were favourable.' No doubt Silanus knew that I was not unversed myself in his lore, as I have so often assisted at the sacrifice; but he added that there were symptoms in the victims of some guile or conspiracy against me. That was a happy discovery on his part, seeing that he was himself conspiring at the moment to traduce me before you; since it was he who set the tale going that I had actually made up my mind to carry out these projects without procuring your consent. Now, for my part, if I saw that you 30 were in any difficulties, I should set myself to discover how you might capture a city, on the understanding of course that all who wished might sail away at once, leaving those who did not wish, to follow at a later date, with something perhaps in their pockets to benefit their friends at home. Now, however, as I see that the men of Heraclea and Sinope are to send you ships to assist you to sail away, and more than one person guarantees to give you regular monthly pay, it is, I admit, a rare chance to be safely piloted to the haven of our hopes, and at the same time to receive pay for our preservation. For myself I have done with that dream, and to those, who came to me to urge these projects, my advice is to have done with them. In fact, this is my view. As long as you stay together united as to-day, you will command respect and procure provisions; for might certainly exercises a right over what belongs to the weaker. But once broken up, with your force split into bits, you will neither be able to get subsistence, nor indeed will you get off without paying dearly for it. In fact, my resolution coincides precisely with yours. It is that we should set off for Hellas, and if any one stops behind, or is caught deserting before the whole army is in safety, let him be judged as an evil-doer. Pray let all who are in favour of this proposition hold up their hands.\"\n\nThey all held them up; only Silanus began shouting and vainly striving to maintain the right of departure for all who liked to depart. But the soldiers would not suffer him, threatening him that if he were himself caught attempting to run away they would inflict the aforesaid penalty. After this, when the Heracleots learned that the departure by sea was resolved upon, and that the measure itself emanated from Xenophon, they sent the vessels indeed; but as to the money which they had promised to Timasion and Thorax as pay for the soldiers, they were not as good as their word, in fact they cheated them both. Thus the two who had guaranteed regular monthly pay were utterly confounded, and stood in terror of the soldiers. What they did then, was to take to them the other generals to whom they had communicated their former transactions (that is to say, all except Neon the Asniaean, who, as lieutenant-general, was acting for Cheirisophus during his continued absence). This done they came in a body to Xenophon and said that 36 their views were changed. As they had now got the ships, they thought it best to sail to the Phasis, and seize the territory of the Phasians (whose present king was a descendant of Aeetes). Xenophon's reply was curt:--Not one syllable would he have to say himself to the army in this matter, \"But,\" he added, \"if you like, you can summon an assembly and have your say.\" Thereupon Timasion the Dardanian set forth as his opinion:--It were best to hold no parliament at present, but first to go and conciliate, each of them, his own officers. Thus they went away and proceeded to execute their plans.\n\n Aeetes is the patronym of the kings of Colchis from mythical times onwards; e.g. Medea was the daughter of Aeetes.\n\nVII\n\nPresently the soldiers came to learn what was in course of agitation, 1 and Neon gave out that Xenophon had persuaded the other generals to adopt his views, and had a plan to cheat the soldiers and take them back to the Phasis. The soldiers were highly indignant; meetings were held; little groups gathered ominously; and there seemed an alarming probability that they would repeat the violence with which they had lately treated the heralds of the Colchians and the clerks of the market; when all who did not save themselves by jumping into the sea were stoned to death. So Xenophon, seeing what a storm was brewing, resolved to anticipate matters so far as to summon a meeting of the men without delay, and thus prevent their collecting of their own accord, and he ordered the herald to announce an assembly. The voice of the herald was no sooner heard than they rushed with great readiness to the place of meeting. Then Xenophon, without accusing the generals of having come to him, made the following speech: \"I hear that a charge is brought against me. It is I apparently who am going to cheat you and carry you off to Phasis. I beg you by all that is holy to listen to me; and if there be found any guilt in me, let me not leave this place till I have paid the penalty of my misdoing; but if my accusers are found guilty, treat them as they deserve. I presume, sirs, you know where the sun rises and where he sets, and that he who would go to Hellas must needs journey towards the sunset; whereas he who seeks the land of the barbarian must contrariwise fix 6 his face towards the dawn. Now is that a point in which a man might hope to cheat you? Could any one make you believe that the sun rises here and sets there, or that he sets here and rises there? And doubtless you know this too, that it is Boreas, the north wind, who bears the mariner out of Pontus towards Hellas, and the south wind inwards towards the Phasis, whence the saying--\n\n\"'When the North wind doth blow Home to Hellas we will go.'\n\n Whether this was a local saying or a proverb I cannot say. The words have a poetical ring about them: \"When Borrhas blows, fair voyages to Hellas.\"\n\n\"He would be a clever fellow who could befool you into embarking with a south wind blowing. That sounds all very well, you think, only I may get you on board during a calm. Granted, but I shall be on board my one ship, and you on board another hundred at least, and how am I to constrain you to voyage with me against your will, or by what cajolery shall I carry you off? But I will imagine you so far befooled and bewitched by me, that I have got you to the Phasis; we proceed to disembark on dry land. At last it will come out, that wherever you are, you are not in Hellas, and the inventor of the trick will be one sole man, and you who have been caught by it will number something like ten thousand with swords in your hands. I do not know how a man could better ensure his own punishment than by embarking on such a policy with regards to himself and you.\n\n\"Nay, these tales are the invention of silly fellows who are jealous of the honour you bestow on me. A most uncalled-for jealousy! Do I hinder any of them from speaking any word of import in his power? of striking a blow in your behalf and his own, if that is his choice? or, finally, of keeping his eyes and ears open to secure your safety? What is it? In your choice of leaders do I stand in the way of any one, is that it? Let him step forward, I yield him place; he shall be your general; only he must prove that he has your good at heart.\n\n\"For myself, I have done; but for yourselves, if any of you conceive 11 either that he himself could be the victim of a fraud, or that he could victimise any one else in such a thing as this, let him open his lips and explain to us how. Take your time, but when you have sifted the matter to your hearts' content, do not go away without suffering me to tell you of something which I see looming. If it should burst upon us and prove in fact anything like what it gives signs of being now, it is time for us to take counsel for ourselves and see that we do not prove ourselves to be the worst and basest of men in the sight of gods and men, be they friends or be they foes.\" The words moved the curiosity of the soldiers. They marvelled what this matter might be, and bade him explain. Thereupon he began again: \"You will not have forgotten certain places in the hills--barbaric fastnesses, but friendly to the Cerasuntines--from which people used to come down and sell us large cattle and other things which they possessed, and if I mistake not, some of you went to the nearest of these places and made purchases in the market and came back again. Clearetus the captain learnt of this place, that it was but a little one and unguarded. Why should it be guarded since it was friendly? so the folk thought. Thus he stole upon it in the dead of night, and meant to sack it without saying a word to any of us. His design was, if he took the place, not to return again to the army, but to mount a vessel which, with his messmates on board her, was sailing past at the time, and stowing away what he had seized, to set sail and begone beyond the Euxine. All this had been agreed upon and arranged with his comrades on board the vessel, as I now discover. Accordingly, he summoned to his side all whom he could persuade, and set off at their head against the little place. But dawn overtook him on his march. The men collected out of their strongholds, and whether from a distance or close quarters, made such a fight that they killed Clearetus and a good many of the rest, and only a few of them got safe back to Cerasus.\n\n\"These things took place on the day on which we started to come hither on foot; while some of those who were to go by sea were still at Cerasus, not having as yet weighed anchor. After this, according to 17 what the Cerasuntines state, there arrived three inhabitants of the place which had been attacked; three elderly men, seeking an interview with our public assembly. Not finding us, they addressed themselves to the men of Cerasus, and told them, they were astonished that we should have thought it right to attack them; however, when, as the Cerasuntines assert, they had assured them that the occurrence was not authorised by public consent, they were pleased, and proposed to sail here, not only to state to us what had occurred, but to offer that those who were interested should take up and bury the bodies of the slain.\n\n\"But among the Hellenes still at Cerasus were some of those who had escaped. They found out in which direction the barbarians were minded to go, and not only had the face themselves to pelt them with stones, but vociferously encouraged their neighbours to do the same. The three men--ambassadors, mark you--were slain, stoned to death. After this occurrence, the men of Cerasus came to us and reported the affair, and we generals, on being informed, were annoyed at what had taken place, and took counsel with the Cerasuntines how the dead bodies of the Hellenes might be buried. While seated in conclave outside the camp, we suddenly were aware of a great hubbub. We heard cries: 'Cut them down!' 'Shoot them!' 'Stone them!' and presently we caught sight of a mass of people racing towards us with stones in their hands, and others picking them up. The Cerasuntines, naturally enough, considering the incident they had lately witnessed, retired in terror to their vessels, and, upon my word, some of us did not feel too comfortable. All I could do was to go to them and inquire what it all meant. Some of them had not the slightest notion, although they had stones in their hands, but chancing on some one who was better informed, I was told by him that 'the clerks of the market were treating the army most scandalously.' Just then some one got sight of the market clerk, Zelarchus, making his way off towards the sea, and lifted up his voice aloud, and the rest responding to the cry as if a 24 wild boar or a stag had been started, they rushed upon him.\n\n\"The Cerasuntines, seeing a rush in their direction, thought that, without a doubt, it was directed against themselves, and fled with all speed and threw themselves into the sea, in which proceeding they were imitated by some few of our own men, and all who did not know how to swim were drowned. But now, what do you think of their case, these men of Cerasus? They had done no wrong. They were simply afraid that some madness had seized us, like that to which dogs are liable.\n\n\"I say then, if proceedings like this are to be the order of the day, you had better consider what the ultimate condition of the army is like to be. As a body you will not have it in your power to undertake war against whom you like, or to conclude peace. But in private any one who chooses will conduct the army on any quest which takes his fancy. And when ambassadors come to you to demand peace, or whatever it may be, officious people will put them to death and prevent your hearing the proposals which brought them to you. The next step will be that those whom you as a body may choose as generals will be of no account; but any one who likes to elect himself general, and will adopt the formula 'Shoot him! shoot him!' will be competent to cut down whomsoever he pleases untried, be it general or private soldier, if only he have sufficient followers, as was the case just now. But just consider what these self-appointed generals have achieved for you. Zelarchus, the clerk of the market, may possibly have done you a wrong; if so, he has sailed off and is gone without paying you any penalty; or he may be guiltless, in which case we have driven him from the army in terror of perishing unjustly without a trial. While those who stoned the ambassadors have contrived so cleverly that we alone of all Hellenes cannot approach Cerasus safely without a strong force, and the corpses which the very men who slew them themselves invited us to bury, we cannot now pick up with safety even under a flag of truce. Who indeed would care to carry a flag of truce, or go as a herald with 30 the blood of heralds upon his hands? All we could do was to implore the Cerasuntines to bury them.\n\n\"If then you approve of such doings, have a resolution passed to that effect, so that, with a prospect of like occurrences in the future, a man may privately set up a guard and do his best to fix his tent where he can find a strong position with a commanding site. If, however, these seem to you to be the deeds rather of wild beasts than of human beings, bethink you of some means by which to stay them; or else, in heaven's name, how shall we do sacrifice to the gods gladly, with impious deeds to answer for? or how shall we, who lay the knife to each other's throats, give battle to our enemies? What friendly city will receive us when they see rampant lawlessness in our midst? Who will have the courage to afford us a market, when we prove our worthlessness in these weightiest concerns? and what becomes of the praise we expect to win from the mouths of men? who will vouchsafe it to us, if this is our behaviour? Should we not ourselves bestow the worst of names on the perpetrators of like deeds?\"\n\nAfter this they rose, and, as one man, proposed that the ringleaders in these matters should be punished; and that for the future, to set an example of lawlessness should be forbidden. Every such ringleader was to be prosecuted on the capital charge; the generals were to bring all offenders to the bar of justice; prosecutions for all other misdemeanours committed since the death of Cyrus were to be instituted; and they ended by constituting the officers into a board of dicasts; and upon the strong representation of Xenophon, with the concurrence of the soothsayers, it was resolved to purify the army, and this purification was made.\n\n I.e. a board of judges or jurors.\n\nVIII\n\nIt was further resolved that the generals themselves should undergo a 1 judicial examination in reference to their conduct in past time. In course of investigation, Philesius and Xanthicles respectively were condemned to pay a sum of twenty minae, to meet a deficiency to that amount incurred during the guardianship of the cargoes of the merchantmen. Sophaenetus was fined ten minae for inadeqate performance of his duty as one of the chief officers selected. Against Xenophon a charge was brought by certain people, who asserted that they had been beaten by him, and framed the indictment as one of personal outrage with violence. Xenophon got up and demanded that the first speaker should state \"where and when it was he had received these blows.\" The other, so challenged, answered, \"When we were perishing of cold and there was a great depth of snow.\" Xenophon said: \"Upon my word, with weather such as you describe, when our provisions had run out, when the wine could not even be smelt, when numbers were dropping down dead beat, so acute was the suffering, with the enemy close on our heels; certainly, if at such a season as that I was guilty of outrage, I plead guilty to being a more outrageous brute than the ass, which is too wanton, they say, to feel fatigue. Still, I wish you would tell us,\" said he, \"what led to my striking you. Did I ask you for something and, on your refusing it to me, did I proceed to beat you? Was it a debt, for which I demanded payment? or a quarrel about some boy or other? Was I the worse for liquor, and behaving like a drunkard?\" When the man met each of these questions with a negative, he questioned him further: \"Are you a heavy infantry soldier?\" \"No,\" said he. \"A peltast, then?\" \"No, nor yet a peltast\"; but he had been ordered by his messmates to drive a mule, although he was a free man. 5 Then at last he recognised him, and inquired: \"Are you the fellow who carried home the sick man?\" \"Yes, I am,\" said he, \"thanks to your driving; and you made havoc of my messmates' kit.\" \"Havoc!\" said Xenophon: \"Nay, I distributed it; some to one man, some to another to carry, and bade them bring the things safely to me; and when I got them back I delivered them all safely to you, and you, on your side, had rendered an account to me of the man. Let me tell you,\" he continued, turning to the court, \"what the circumstances were; it is worth hearing:--\n\n See the \"Dict. of Antiq.\" 622 a. HYBREOS GRAPHE. In the case of common assaults as opposed to indecent assault, the prosecution seems to have been allowable only when the object of a wanton attack was a free person. Cf. Arist. \"Rhet.\" ii. 24.\n\n\"A man was left behind from inability to proceed farther; I recognised the poor fellow sufficiently to see that he was one of ours, and I forced you, sir, to carry him to save his life. For if I am not much mistaken, the enemy were close at our heels?\" The fellow assented to this. \"Well then,\" said Xenophon, \"after I had sent you forward, I overtook you again, as I came up with the rearguard; you were digging a trench with intent to bury the man; I pulled up and said something in commendation; as we stood by the poor fellow twitched his leg, and the bystanders all cried out, 'Why, the man's alive!' Your remark was: 'Alive or not as he likes, I am not going to carry him' Then I struck you. Yes! you are right, for it looked very much as if you knew him to be alive.\" \"Well,\" said he, \"was he any the less dead when I reported him to you?\" \"Nay,\" retorted Xenophon, \"by the same token we shall all one day be dead, but that is no reason why meantime we should all be buried alive?\" Then there was a general shout: \"If Xenophon had given the fellow a few more blows, it might have been better.\" The others were now called upon to state the grounds on which they had been beaten in each case; but when they refused to get up, he proceeded to state them himself.\n\n\"I confess, sirs, to having struck certain men for failure in discipline. These were men who were quite content to owe their safety to us. Whilst the rest of the world marched on in rank and did whatever fighting had to be done, they preferred to leave the ranks, and rush forward to loot and enrich themselves at our expense. Now, if 13 this conduct were to be the rule, general ruin would be the result. I do not deny that I have given blows to this man or the other who played the poltroon and refused to get up, helplessly abandoning himself to the enemy; and so I forced them to march on. For once in the severe wintry weather I myself happened to sit down for a long time, whilst waiting for a party who were getting their kit together, and I discovered how difficult it was to get up again and stretch one's legs. After this personal experience, whenever I saw any one else seated in slack and lazy mood, I tried to spur him on. The mere movement and effort to play the man caused warmth and moisture, whereas it was plain that sitting down and keeping quiet helped the blood to freeze and the toes to mortify, calamities which really befell several of the men, as you yourselves are aware.\n\n\"I can imagine a third case, that of some straggler stopping behind, merely to rest for rest's sake, and hindering you in front and us behind alike from pressing on the march. If he got a blow with the fist from me it saved him a thrust with the lance from the enemy. In fact, the opportunity they enjoy to-day of taking vengeance on me for any treatment which I put upon them wrongfully, is derived from their salvation then; whereas, if they had fallen into the enemy's hands, let them ask themselves for what outrage, however great, they could expect to get satisfaction now. My defence,\" he continued, \"is simple: if I chastised any one for his own good, I claim to suffer the same penalties as parents pay their children or masters their boys. Does not the surgeon also cauterise and cut us for our good? But if you really believe that these acts are the outcome of wanton insolence, I beg you to observe that although to-day, thank God! I am heartier than formerly, I wear a bolder front now than then, and I drink more wine, yet I never strike a soul; no, for I see that you have reached smooth water. When storm arises, and a great sea strikes the vessel amidships, a mere shake of the head will make the look-out man furious with the crew in the forecastle, or the helmsman with the men in the stern sheets, for at such a crisis even a slight slip may ruin everything. But I appeal to your own verdict, already recorded, in 21 proof that I was justified in striking these men. You stood by, sirs, with swords, not voting tablets, in your hands, and it was in your power to aid the fellows if you liked; but, to speak the honest truth, you neither aided them nor did you join me in striking the disorderly. In other words, you enabled any evilly-disposed person among them to give rein to his wantonness by your passivity. For if you will be at pains to investigate, you will find that those who were then most cowardly are the ringleaders to-day in brutality and outrage.\n\n\"There is Boiscus the boxer, a Thessalian, what a battle he fought then to escape carrying his shield! so tired was he, and to-day I am told he has stripped several citizens of Cotyora of the clothes on their backs. If then you are wise, you will treat this personage in a way the contrary to that in which men treat dogs. A savage dog is tied up on the day and loosed at night, but if you are wise you will tie this fellow up at night and only let him loose in the day.\n\n\"But really,\" he added, \"it does surprise me with what keenness you remember and recount the times when I incurred the hatred of some one; but some other occasions when I eased the burden of winter and storm for any of you, or beat off an enemy, or helped to minister to you in sickness and want, not a soul of you remembers these. Or when for any noble deed done by any of you I praised the doer, and according to my ability did honour to this brave man or that; these things have slipped from your memories, and are clean forgotten. Yet it were surely more noble, just, and holy, sweeter and kindlier to treasure the memory of good rather than of evil.\"\n\nHe ended, and then one after another of the assembly got up and began recalling incidents of the kind suggested, and things ended not so unpleasantly after all.\n\n\nBOOK VI\n\nI\n\nAfter this, whilst waiting, they lived partly on supplies from the 1 market, partly on the fruit of raids into Paphlagonia. The Paphlagonians, on their side, showed much skill in kidnapping stragglers, wherever they could lay hands on them, and in the night time tried to do mischief to those whose quarters were at a distance from the camp. The result was that their relations to one another were exceedingly hostile, so much so that Corylas, who was the chief of Paphlagonia at that date, sent ambassadors to the Hellenes, bearing horses and fine apparel, and charged with a proposal on the part of Corylas to make terms with the Hellenes on the principle of mutual forbearance from injuries. The generals replied that they would consult with the army about the matter. Meanwhile they gave them a hospitable reception, to which they invited certain members of the army whose claims were obvious. They sacrificed some of the captive cattle and other sacrificial beasts, and with these they furnished forth a sufficiently festal entertainment, and reclining on their truckle beds, fell to eating and drinking out of beakers made of horn which they happened to find in the country.\n\nBut as soon as the libation was ended and they had sung the hymn, up got first some Thracians, who performed a dance under arms to the sound of a pipe, leaping high into the air with much nimbleness, and brandishing their swords, till at last one man struck his fellow, and every one thought he was really wounded, so skilfully and artistically 6 did he fall, and the Paphlagonians screamed out. Then he that gave the blow stripped the other of his arms, and marched off chanting the \"Sitalcas,\" whilst others of the Thracians bore off the other, who lay as if dead, though he had not received even a scratch.\n\n I.e. the national Thracian hymn; for Sitalcas the king, a national hero, see Thuc. ii. 29.\n\nAfter this some Aenianians and Magnesians got up and fell to dancing the Carpaea, as it is called, under arms. This was the manner of the dance: one man lays aside his arms and proceeds to drive a yoke of oxen, and while he drives he sows, turning him about frequently, as though he were afraid of something; up comes a cattle-lifter, and no sooner does the ploughman catch sight of him afar, than he snatches up his arms and confronts him. They fight in front of his team, and all in rhythm to the sound of the pipe. At last the robber binds the countryman and drives off the team. Or sometimes the cattle-driver binds the robber, and then he puts him under the yoke beside the oxen, with his two hands tied behind his back, and off he drives.\n\n The Aenianians, an Aeolian people inhabiting the upper valley of the Sperchius (the ancient Phthia); their capital was Hypata. These men belonged to the army collected by Menon, the Thessalian. So, doubtless, did the Magnesians, another Aeolian tribe occupying the mountainous coast district on the east of Thessaly. See Kiepert's \"Man. Anct. Geog.\" (Macmillan's tr.), chap. vi.. 161, 170.\n\nAfter this a Mysian came in with a light shield in either hand and danced, at one time going through a pantomime, as if he were dealing with two assailants at once; at another plying his shields as if to face a single foe, and then again he would whirl about and throw somersaults, keeping the shields in his hands, so that it was a beautiful spectacle. Last of all he danced the Persian dance, clashing the shields together, crouching down on one knee and springing up again from earth; and all this he did in measured time to the sound of the flute. After him the Mantineans stepped upon the stage, and some other Arcadians also stood up; they had accoutred themselves in all their warlike finery. They marched with measured tread, pipes playing, to the tune of the 'warrior's march'; the notes of the paean rose, 11 lightly their limbs moved in dance, as in solemn procession to the holy gods. The Paphlagonians looked upon it as something truly strange that all these dances should be under arms; and the Mysians, seeing their astonishment persuaded one of the Arcadians who had got a dancing girl to let him introduce her, which he did after dressing her up magnificently and giving her a light shield. When, lithe of limb, she danced the Pyrrhic, loud clapping followed; and the Paphlagonians asked, \"If these women fought by their side in battle?\" to which they answered, \"To be sure, it was the women who routed the great King, and drove him out of camp.\" So ended the night.\n\n See Plato, \"Rep.\" 400 B, for this \"war measure\"; also Aristoph. \"Clouds,\" 653.\n\n For this famous dance, supposed to be of Doric (Cretan or Spartan) origin, see Smith's \"Dict. of Antiquities,\" \"Saltatio\"; also Guhl and Koner, \"The Life of the Greeks and Romans,\" Eng. tr.\n\nBut next day the generals introduced the embassy to the army, and the soldiers passed a resolution in the sense proposed: between themselves and the Paphlagonians there was to be a mutual abstinence from injuries. After this the ambassadors went on their way, and the Hellenes, as soon as it was thought that sufficient vessels had arrived, went on board ship, and voyaged a day and a night with a fair breeze, keeping Paphlagonia on their left. And on the following day, arriving at Sinope, they came to moorings in the harbour of Harmene, near Sinope. The Sinopeans, though inhabitants of Paphlagonia, are really colonists of the Milesians. They sent gifts of hospitality to the Hellenes, three thousand measures of barley with fifteen hundred jars of wine. At this place Cheirisophus rejoined them with a man-of-war. The soldiers certainly expected that, having come, he would have brought them something, but he brought them nothing, except complimentary phrases, on the part of Anaxibius, the high admiral, and the rest, who sent them their congratulations, coupled with a promise on the part of Anaxibius that, as soon as they were outside the Euxine, pay would be forthcoming.\n\n Harmene, a port of Sinope, between four and five miles (fifty stades) west of that important city, itself a port town. See Smith, \"Dict. Geog.,\" \"Sinope\"; and Kiepert, op. cit. chap. iv. 60.\n\nAt Harmene the army halted five days; and now that they seemed to be 17 so close to Hellas, the question how they were to reach home not empty-handed presented itself more forcibly to their minds than heretofore. The conclusion they came to was to appoint a single general, since one man would be better able to handle the troops, by night or by day, than was possible while the generalship was divided. If secrecy were desirable, it would be easier to keep matters dark, or if again expedition were an object, there would be less risk of arriving a day too late, since mutual explanations would be avoided, and whatever approved itself to the single judgement would at once be carried into effect, whereas previously the generals had done everything in obedience to the opinion of the majority.\n\nWith these ideas working in their minds, they turned to Xenophon, and the officers came to him and told him that this was how the soldiers viewed matters; and each of them, displaying a warmth of kindly feeling, pressed him to accept the office. Xenophon partly would have liked to do so, in the belief that by so doing he would win to himself a higher repute in the esteem of his friends, and that his name would be reported to the city written large; and by some stroke of fortune he might even be the discoverer of some blessing to the army collectively.\n\nThese and the like considerations elated him; he had a strong desire to hold the supreme command. But then again, as he turned the matter over, the conviction deepened in his mind that the issue of the future is to every man uncertain; and hence there was the risk of perhaps losing such reputation has he had already acquired. He was in sore straights, and, not knowing how to decide, it seemed best to him to lay the matter before heaven. Accordingly, he led two victims to the altar and made sacrifice to Zeus the King, for it was he and no other who had been named by the oracle at Delphi, and his belief was that the vision which he had beheld when he first essayed to undertake the joint administration of the army was sent to him by that god. He also recalled to mind a circumstance which befell him still earlier, when 23 setting out from Ephesus to associate himself with Cyrus;--how an eagle screamed on his right hand from the east, and still remained perched, and the soothsayer who was escorting him said that it was a great and royal omen; indicating glory and yet suffering; for the punier race of birds only attack the eagle when seated. \"Yet,\" added he, \"it bodes not gain in money; for the eagle seizes his food, not when seated, but on the wing.\"\n\n Cf. \"Cyrop.\" II. i. 1; an eagle appears to Cyrus on the frontiers of Persia, when about to join his uncle Cyaxares, king of Media, on his expedition against the Assyrian.\n\n It is important to note that the Greek word {oionos}, a solitary or lone-flying bird, also means an omen. \"It was a mighty bird and a mighty omen.\"\n\nThus Xenophon sacrificed, and the god as plainly as might be gave him a sign, neither to demand the generalship, nor, if chosen, to accept the office. And that was how the matter stood when the army met, and the proposal to elect a single leader was unanimous. After this resolution was passed, they proposed Xenophon for election, and when it seemed quite evident that they would elect him, if he put the question to the vote, he got up and spoke as follows:--\n\n\"Sirs, I am but mortal, and must needs be happy to be honoured by you. I thank you, and am grateful, and my prayer is that the gods may grant me to be an instrument of blessing to you. Still, when I consider it closer, thus, in the presence of a Lacedaemonian, to be preferred by you as general, seems to me but ill conducive either to your interests or to mine, since you will the less readily obtain from them hereafter anything you may need, while for myself I look upon acceptance as even somewhat dangerous. Do I not see and know with what persistence these Lacedaemonians prosecuted the war till finally they forced our State to acknowledge the leadership of Lacedaemon? This confession once extorted from their antagonists, they ceased warring at once, and the seige of the city was at an end. If, with these facts before my eyes, I seem to be doing all I can to neutralise their high self-esteem, I cannot escape the reflection that personally I may be taught wisdom by a painful process. But with your own idea that under a single general there will be less factiousness than when there were many, be assured 29 that in choosing some other than me you will not find me factious. I hold that whosoever sets up factious opposition to his leader factiously opposes his own safety. While if you determine to choose me, I should not be surprised were that choice to entail upon you and me the resentment of other people.\"\n\nAfter those remarks on Xenophon's part, many more got up, one after another, insisting on the propriety of his undertaking the command. One of them, Agasias the Stymphalian, said: It was really ridiculous, if things had come to this pass that the Lacedeamonians are to fly into a rage because a number of friends have met together to dinner, and omitted to choose a Lacedaemonian to sit at the head of the table. \"Really, if that is how matters stand,\" said he, \"I do not see what right we have to be officers even, we who are only Arcadians.\" That sally brought down the plaudits of the assembly; and Xenophon, seeing that something more was needed, stepped forward again and spoke, \"Pardon, sirs,\" he said, \"let me make a clean breast of it. I swear to you by all the gods and goddesses; verily and indeed, I no sooner perceived your purpose, than I consulted the victims, whether it was better for you to entrust this leadership to me, and for me to undertake it, or the reverse. And the gods vouchsafed a sign to me so plain that even a common man might understand it, and perceive that from such sovereignty I must needs hold myself aloof.\"\n\nUnder these circumstances they chose Cheirisophus, who, after his election, stepped forward and said: \"Nay, sirs, be well assured of this, that had you chosen some one else, I for my part should not have set up factious opposition. As to Xenophon, I believe you have done him a good turn by not appointing him; for even now Dexippus has gone some way in traducing him to Anaxibius, as far as it lay in his power to do so, and that, in spite of my attempts to silence him. What he said was that he believed Xenophon would rather share the command of Clearchus's army with Timasion, a Dardanian, than with himself, a Laconian. But,\" continued Cheirisophus, \"since your choice has fallen 33 upon me, I will make it my endeavour to do you all the good in my power; so make your preparations to weigh anchor to-morrow; wind and weather permitting, we will voyage to Heraclea; every one must endeavour, therefore, to put in at that port; and for the rest we will consult, when we are come thither.\"\n\nII\n\nThe next day they weighed anchor and set sail from Harmene with a fair 1 breeze, two days' voyage along the coast. , where, as the story says, the ship Argo came to moorings; and then the mouths of the rivers, first the Thermodon, then the Iris, then the Halys, and next to it the Parthenius.] Coasting past , they reached Heraclea, a Hellenic city and a colony of the Megarians, situated in the territory of the Mariandynians. So they came to achorage off the Acherusian Chersonese, where Heracles is said to have descended to bring up the dog Cerberus, at a point where they still show the marks of his descent, a deep cleft more than two furlongs down. Here the Heracleots sent the Hellenes, as gifts of hospitality, three thousand measures of barley and two thousand jars of wine, twenty beeves and one hundred sheep. Through the flat country here flows the Lycus river, as it is called, about two hundred feet in breadth.\n\n I have left this passage in the text, although it involves, at first sight, a topographical error on the part of whoever wrote it, and Hug and other commentators regard it as spurious. Jason's beach (the modern Yasoun Bouroun) and the three first-named rivers lie between Cotyora and Sinope. Possibly the author, or one of his editors, somewhat loosely inserted a recapitulatory note concerning the scenery of this coasting voyage at this point. \"By the way, I ought to have told you that as they coasted along,\" etc.\n\n One of the most powerful of commercial cities, distinguished as Pontica (whence, in the middle ages, Penteraklia), now Eregli. It was one of the older Greek settlements, and, like Kalchedon (to give that town its proper name), a Megaro-Doric colony. See Kiepert, op. cit. chap. iv. 62.\n\n According to another version of the legend Heracles went down to bring up Cerberus, not here, but at Taenarum.\n\nThe soldiers held a meeting, and took counsel about the remainder of the journey: should they make their exit from the Pontus by sea or by land? and Lycon the Achaean got up and said: \"I am astonished, sirs, that the generals do not endeavour to provide us more efficiently with provisions. These gifts of hospitality will not afford three days' 4 victuals for the army; nor do I see from what region we are to provide ourselves as we march. My proposal, therefore, is to demand of the Heracleots at least three thousand cyzicenes.\" Another speaker suggested, \"not less than ten thousand. Let us at once, before we break up this meeting, send ambassadors to the city and ascertain their answer to the demand and take counsel accordingly.\" Thereupon they proceeded to put up as ambassadors, first and foremost Cheirisophus, as he had been chosen general-in-chief; others also named Xenophon.\n\nBut both Cheirisophus and Xenophon stoutly declined, maintaining both alike that they could not compel a Hellenic city, actually friendly, to give anything which they did not spontaneously offer. So, since these two appeared to be backward, the soldiers sent Lycon the Achaean, Callimachus the Parrhasian, and Agasias the Stymphalian. These three went and announced the resolutions passed by the army. Lycon, it was said, even went so far as to threaten certain consequences in case they refused to comply. The Heracleots said they would deliberate; and, without more ado, they got together their goods and chattels from their farms and fields outside, and dismantled the market outside and transferred it within, after which the gates were closed, and arms appeared at the battlements of the walls.\n\nAt that check, the authors of these tumultuary measures fell to accusing the generals, as if they had marred the proceeding; and the Arcadians and Archaeans banded together, chiefly under the auspiecs of the two ringleaders, Callimachus the Parrhasian and Lycon the Achaean. The language they held was to this effect: It was outrageous that a single Athenian and a Lacedaemonian, who had not contributed a soldier to the expedition, should rule Peloponnesians; scandalous that they themselves should bear the toils whilst others pocketed the spoils, and that too though the preservation of the army was due to themselves; for, as every one must admit, to the Arcadians and 10 Achaeans the credit of that achievement was due, and the rest of the army went for nothing (which was indeed so far true that the Arcadians and Achaeans did form numerically the larger half of the whole army). What then did common sense suggest? Why, that they, the Arcadians and Achaeans, should make common cause, choose generals for themselves independently, continue the march, and try somewhat to better their condition. This proposal was carried. All the Arcadians and Achaeans who chanced to be with Cheirisophus left him and Xenophon, setting up for themselves and choosing ten generals of their own. These ten, it was decreed, were to put into effect such measures as approved themselves to the majority. Thus the absolute authority vested in Cheirisophus was terminated there and then, within less than a week of his appointment.\n\nXenophon, however was minded to prosecute the journey in their campany, thinking that this would be a safer plan than for each to start on his own account. But Neon threw in his weight in favour of separate action. \"Every one for himself,\" he said, for he had heard from Cheirisophus that Cleander, the Spartan governor-general at Byzantium, talked of coming to Calpe Haven with some war vessels. Neon's advice was due to his desire to secure a passage home in these war vessels for themselves and their soldiers, without allowing any one else to share in their good-fortune. As for Cheirisophus, he was at once so out of heart at the turn things had taken, and soured with the whole army, that he left it to his subordinate, Neon, to do just what he liked. Xenophon, on his side, would still have been glad to be quit of the expedition and sail home; but on offering sacrifice to Heracles the Leader, and seeking advice, whether it were better and more desirable to continue the march in charge of the soldiers who had remained faithful, or to take his departure, the god indicated to him by the victims that he should adopt the former course.\n\nIn this way the army was now split up into three divisions. First, the Arcadians and Achaeans, over four thousand five hundred men, all heavy infantry. Secondly, Cheirisophus and his men, viz. one thousand 16 four hundred heavy infantry and the seven hundred peltasts, or Clearchus's Thracians. Thirdly, Xenophon's division of one thousand seven hundred heavy infantry, and three hundred peltasts; but then he alone had the cavalry--about forty troopers.\n\n The total now amounted to 8640 and over.\n\nThe Arcadians, who had bargained with the Heracleots and got some vessels from them, were the first to set sail; they hoped, by pouncing suddenly on the Bithynians, to make as large a haul as possible. With that object they disembarked at Calpe Haven, pretty nearly at the middle point in Thrace. Cheirisophus setting off straight from Heraclea, commenced a land march through the country; but having entered into Thrace, he preferred to cling to the seaboard, health and strength failing him. Xenophon, lastly, took vessels, and disembarking on the confines of Thrace and the Heracleotid, pushed forward through the heart of the country.\n\n The Haven of Calpe = Kirpe Liman or Karpe in the modern maps. The name is interesting as being also the ancient name of the rock fortress of Gibraltar.\n\n Some MSS. here read, \"In the prior chapter will be found a description of the manner in which the absolute command of Cheirisophus was abruptly terminated and the army of the Hellenes broken up. The sequel will show how each of these divisions fared.\" The passage is probably one of those commentators' notes, with which we are now familiar.\n\nIII\n\nThe Arcadians, disembarking under cover of night at Calpe Haven, 1 marched against the nearest villages about thirty furlongs from the sea; and as soon as it was light, each of the ten generals led his company to attack one village, or if the village were large, a couple of companies advanced under their combined generals. They further agreed upon a certain knoll, where they were all eventually to assemble. So sudden was their attack that they seized a number of captives and enclosed a multitude of small cattle. But the Thracians who escaped began to collect again; for being light-armed troops they had slipped in large numbers through the hands of the heavy infantry; and now that they were got together they first attacked the company of the Arcadian general, Smicres, who had done his work and was retiring to the appointed meeting-place, driving along a large train of captives and cattle. For a good while the Hellenes maintained a running fight; but at the passage of a gorge the enemy routed them, 5 slaying Smicres himself and those with him to a man. The fate of another company under command of Hegesander, another of the ten, was nearly as bad; only eight men escaped, Hegesander being one of them. The remaining captains eventually met, some with somewhat to show for their pains, others empty-handed.\n\n Lit. \"marched and fought,\" as did the forlorn hope under Sir C. Wilson making its way from Abu Klea to the Nile in Jan. 1885.\n\nThe Thracians, having achieved this success, kept up a continual shouting and clatter of conversation to one another during the night; but with day-dawn they marshalled themselves right round the knoll on which the Hellenes were encamped--both cavalry in large numbers and light-armed troops--while every minute the stream of new-comers grew greater. Then they commenced an attack on the heavy infantry in all security, for the Hellenes had not a single bowman, javelin-man, or mounted trooper amongst them; while the enemy rushed forward on foot or galloped up on horseback and let fly their javelins. It was vain to attempt to retaliate, so lightly did they spring back and escape; and ever the attack renewed itself from every point, so that on one side man after man was wounded, on the other not a soul was touched; the result being that they could not stir from their position, and the Thracians ended by cutting them off even from their water. In their despair they began to parley about a truce, and finally various concessions were made and terms agreed to between them; but the Thracians would not hear of giving hostages in answer to the demand of the Hellenes; at that point the matter rested. So fared it with the Arcadians.\n\nAs to Cheirisophus, that general prosecuted his march along the 10 seaboard, and without check reached Calpe Haven. Xenophon advanced through the heart of the country; and his cavalry pushing on in front, came upon some old men pursuing their road somewither, who were brought to him, and in answer to his question, whether they had caught sight of another Hellenic army anywhere, told him all that had already taken place, adding that at present they were being besieged upon a knoll with all the Thracians in close circle round them. Thereupon he kept the old men under strict guard to serve as guides in case of need; next, having appointed outposts, he called a meeting of the soldiers, and addressed them: \"Soldiers, some of the Arcadians are dead and the rest are being besieged upon a certain knoll. Now my own belief is, that if they are to perish, with their deaths the seal is set to our own fate: since we must reckon with an enemy at once numerous and emboldened. Clearly our best course is to hasten to their rescue, if haply we may find them still alive, and do battle by their side rather than suffer isolation, confronting danger single-handed.\n\n\"Let us then at once push forward as far as may seem opportune till supper-time, and then encamp. As long as we are marching, let Timasion, with the cavalry, gallop on in front, but without losing sight of us; and let him examine all closely in front, so that nothing may escape our observation.\" (At the same time too, he sent out some nimble fellows of the light-armed troops to the flanks and to the high tops, who were to give a signal if they espied anything anywhere; ordering them to burn everything inflammable which lay in their path.) \"As for ourselves,\" he continued, \"we need not look to find cover in any direction; for it is a long step back to Heraclea and a long leap across to Chrysopolis, and the enemy is at the door. The shortest road is to Calpe Haven, where we suppose Cheirisophus, if safe, to be; but then, when we get there, at Calpe Haven there are no vessels for us to sail away in; and if we stop here, we have not provisions for a single day. Suppose the beleaguered Arcadians left to their fate, we shall find it but a sorry alternative to run the gauntlet with Cheirisophus's detachment alone; better to save them if we can, and 17 with united forces work out our deliverance in common. But if so, we must set out with minds prepared, since to-day either a glorious death awaits us or the achievement of a deed of noblest emprise in the rescue of so many Hellene lives. Maybe it is God who leads us thus, God who chooses to humble the proud boaster, boasting as though he were exceedingly wise, but for us, the beginning of whose every act is by heaven's grace, that same God reserves a higher grade of honour. One duty I would recall to you, to apply your minds to the execution of the orders with promptitude.\"\n\nWith these words he led the way. The cavalry, scattering as far in advance as was prudent, wherever they set foot, set fire. The peltasts moving parallel on the high ground were similarly employed, burning everything combustible they could discover. While the main army, wherever they came upon anything which had accidentally escaped, completed the work, so that the whole country looked as if it were ablaze; and the army might easily pass for a larger one. When the hour had come, they turned aside to a knoll and took up quarters; and there they espied the enemy's watch-fires. He was about forty furlongs distant. On their side also they kindled as many watch-fires as possible; but as soon as they had dined the order was passed to quench all the fires. So during the night they posted guards and slept. But at daybreak they offered prayers to the gods, and drawing up in order of battle, began marching with what speed they might. Timasion and the cavalry, who had the guides with them, and were moving on briskly in front, found themselves without knowing it at the very knoll upon which the Hellenes had been beleaguered. But no army could they discover, whether of friend or foe; only some starveling old women and men, with a few sheep and oxen which had been left behind. This news they reproted to Xenophon and the main body. At first the marvel was what had happened; but ere long they found out by inquiries from the folk who had been left behind, that the Thracians had set off immediately after sundown, and were gone; the Hellenes had waited till morning before they made off, but in what direction, they could not 23 say.\n\nOn hearing this, Xenophon's troops first breakfasted, and then getting their kit together began their march, desiring to unite with the rest at Calpe's Haven without loss of time. As they continued their march, they came across the track of the Arcadians and Achaeans along the road to Calpe, and both divisions arriving eventually at the same place, were overjoyed to see one another again, and they embraced each other like brothers. Then the Arcadians inquired of Xenophon's officers--why they had quenched the watch-fires? \"At first,\" said they, \"when we lost sight of your watch-fires, we expected you to attack the enemy in the night; and the enemy, so at least we imagined, must have been afraid of that and so set off. The time at any rate at which they set off would correspond. But when the requisite time had elapsed and you did not come, we concluded that you must have learnt what was happening to us, and in terror had made a bolt for it to the seaboard. We resolved not to be left behind by you; and that is how we also came to march hither.\"\n\nIV\n\nDuring this day they contented themselves with bivouacking there on 1 the beach at the harbour. The place which goes by the name of Calpe Haven is in Asiatic Thrace, the name given to a region extending from the mouth of the Euxine all the way to Heraclea, which lies on the right hand as you sail into the Euxine. It is a long day's voyage for a war-ship, using her three banks of oars, from Byzantium to Heraclea, and between these two there is not a single Hellenic or friendly city, but only these Bithynian Thracians, who have a bad reputation for the savagery with which they treat any Hellenes cast ashore by shipwreck or otherwise thrown into their power.\n\nNow the haven of Calpe lies exactly midway, halving the voyage between Byzantium and Heraclea. It is a long promontory running out into the sea; the seaward portion being a rocky precipice, at no point less than twenty fathons high; but on the landward side there is a neck 3 about four hundred feet wide; and the space inside the neck is capable of accommodating ten thousand inhabitants, and there is a haven immediately under the crag with a beach facing the west. Then there is a copious spring of fresh water flowing on the very marge of the sea commanded by the stronghold. Again, there is plenty of wood of various sorts; but most plentiful of all, fine shipbuilding timber down to the very edge of the sea. The upland stretches into the heart of the country for twenty furlongs at least. It is good loamy soil, free from stones. For a still greater distance the seaboard is thickly grown with large timber trees of every description. The surrounding country is beautiful and spacious, containing numerous well populated villages. The soil produces barley and wheat, and pulse of all sorts, millet and sesame, figs in ample supply, with numerous vines producing sweet wines, and indeed everything else except olives. Such is the character of the country.\n\nThe tents were pitched on the seaward-facing beach, the soldiers being altogether averse to camping on ground which might so easily be converted into a city. Indeed, their arrival at the place at all seemed very like the crafty design of some persons who were minded to form a city. The aversion was not unnatural, since the majority of the soldiers had not left their homes on so long a voyage from scantiness or subsistence, but attracted by the fame of Cyrus's virtues; some of them bringing followers, while others had expended money on the expedition. And amongst them was a third set who had run away from fathers and mothers; while a different class had left children behind, hoping to return to them with money or other gains. Other people with Cyrus won great success, they were told; why should it not be so with them? Being persons then of this description, the one longing of their hearts was to reach Hellas safely.\n\n I.e. \"his society was itself a passport to good fortune.\"\n\nIt was on the day after their meeting that Xenophon sacrificed as a preliminary to a military expedition; for it was needful to march out in search of provisions, besides which he designed burying the dead. 9 As soon as the victims proved favourable they all setout, the Arcadians following with the rest. The majority of the dead, who had lain already five days, they buried just where they had fallen, in groups; to remove their bodies now would have been impossible. Some few, who lay off the roads, they got together and buried with what splendour they could, considering the means in their power. Others they could not find, and for these they erected a great cenotaph, and covered it with wreaths. When it was all done, they returned home to camp. At that time they supped, and went to rest.\n\n \"Cenotaph\", i.e. \"an empty tomb.\" The word is interesting as occuring only in Xenophon, until we come to the writers of the common dialect. Compare \"hyuscyamus,\" hogbean, our henbane, which we also owe to Xenophon. \"Oecon.\" i. 13, see Sauppe, \"Lexil. Xen.\" s.vv.\n\nNext day there was a general meeting of the soldiers, collected chiefly by Agasias the Stymphalian, a captain, and Hieronymus, an Eleian, also a captain, and other seniors of the Arcadians; and they passed a resolution that, for the future, whoever revived the idea of breaking up the army should be punished by death. And the army, it was decided, would now resume its old position under the command of its former generals. Though Cheirisophus, indeed, had already died under medical treatment for fever; and Neon the Asinaean had taken his place.\n\n This I take to be the meaning of the words, which are necessarily ambiguous, since {pharmakon}, \"a drug,\" also means \"poison.\" Did Cheirisophus conceivably die of fever brought on by some poisonous draught? or did he take poison whilst suffering from fever? or did he die under treatment?\n\nAfter these resolutions Xenophon got up and said: \"Soldiers, the journey must now, I presume, be conducted on foot; indeed, this is clear, since we have no vessels; and we are driven to commence it at once, for we have no provisions if we stop. We then,\" he continued, \"will sacrifice, and you must prepare yourselves to fight now, if ever, for the spirit of the enemy has revived.\"\n\nThereupon the generals sacrificed, in the presence of the Arcadian seer, Arexion; for Silanus the Ambraciot had chartered a vessel at Heraclea and made his escape ere this. Sacrificing with a view to 13 departure, the victims proved unfavourable to them. Accordingly they waited that day. Certain people were bold enough to say that Xenophon, out of his desire to colonise the place, had persuaded the seer to say that the victims were unfavourable to departure. Consequently he proclaimed by herald next morning that any one who liked should be present at the sacrifice; or if he were a seer he was bidden to be present and help to inspect the victims. Then he sacrificed, and there were numbers present; but though the sacrifice on the question of departure was repeated as many as three times, the victims were persistently unfavourable. Thereat the soldiers were in high dudgeon, for the provisions they had brought with them had reached the lowest ebb, and there was no market to be had.\n\nConsequently there was another meeting, and Xenophon spoke again: \"Men,\" said he, \"the victims are, as you may see for yourselves, not yet favourable to the march; but meanwhile, I can see for myself that you are in need of provisions; accordingly we must narrow the sacrifice to the particular point.\" Some one got up and said: \"Naturally enough the victims are unfavourable, for, as I learnt from some one on a vessel which arrived here yesterday by accident, Cleander, the governor at Byzantium, intends coming here with ships and men-of-war.\" Thereat they were all in favour of stopping; but they must needs go out for provisions, and with this object he again sacrificed three times, and the victims remained adverse. Things had now reached such a pass that the men actually came to Xenophon's tent to proclaim that they had no provisions. His sole answer was that he would not lead them out till the victims were favourable.\n\nSo again the next day he sacrificed; and nearly the whole army, so strong was the general anxiety, flocked round the victims; and now the very victims themselves failed. So the generals, instead of leading out the army, called the men together. Xenophon, as was incumbent on him, spoke: \"It is quite possible that the enemy are collected in a body, and we shall have to fight. If we were to leave our baggage in the strong place\" (pointing overhead) \"and sally forth prepared for battle, the victims might favour us.\" But the soldiers, on hearing 22 this proposal, cried out, \"No need to take us inside that place; better sacrifice with all speed.\" Now sheep there were none any longer. So they purchased oxen from under a wagon and sacrificed; and Xenophon begged Cleanor the Arcadian to superintend the sacrifice on his behalf, in case there might be some change now. But even so there was no improvement.\n\nNow Neon was general in place of Cheirisophus, and seeing the men suffering so cruelly from want, he was willing to do them a good turn. So he got hold of some Heracleot or other who said he knew of villages close by from which they could get provisions, and proclaimed by herald: \"If any one liked to come out and get provisions, be it known that he, Neon, would be their leader.\" So out came the men with spears, and wine skins and sacks and other vessels--two thousand strong in all. But when they had reached the villages and began to scatter for the purpose of foraging, Pharnabazus's cavalry were the first to fall upon them. They had come to the aid of the Bithynians, wishing, if possible, in conjunction with the latter, to hinder the Hellenes from entering Phrygia. These troopers killed no less than five hundred of the men; the rest fled for the lives up into the hill country.\n\nNews of the catastrophe was presently brought into camp by one of those who had escaped, and Xenophon, seeing that the victims had not been favourable on that day, took a wagon bullock, in the absence of other sacrificial beasts, offered it up, and started for the rescue, he and the rest under thirty years of age to the last man. Thus they picked up the remnant of Neon's party and returned to camp. It was now about sunset; and the Hellenes in deep despondency were making their evening meal, when all of a sudden, through bush and brake, a party of Bithynians fell upon the pickets, cutting down some and chasing the rest into camp. In the midst of screams and shouts the Hellenes ran to their arms, one and all; yet to pursue or move the camp in the night seemed hardly safe, for the ground was thickly grown with bush; all they could do was to strengthen the outposts and keep watch under arms the livelong night.\n\nV\n\nAnd so they spent the night, but with day-dawn the generals led the 1 way into the natural fastness, and the others picked up their arms and baggage and followed the lead. Before the breakfast-hour arrived, they had fenced off with a ditch the only side on which lay ingress into the place, and had palisaded off the whole, leaving only three gates. Anon a ship from Heraclea arrived bringing barleymeal, victim animals, and wine.\n\nXenophon was up betimes, and made the usual offering before starting on an expedition, and at the first victim the sacrifice was favourable. Just as the sacrifice ended, the seer, Arexion the Parrhasian, caught sight of an eagle, which boded well, and bade Xenophon lead on. So they crossed the trench and grounded arms. Then proclamation was made by herald for the soldiers to breakfast and start on an expedition under arms; the mob of sutlers and the captured slaves would be left in camp. Accordingly the mass of the troops set out. Neon alone remained; for it seemed best to leave that general and his men to guard the contents of the camp. But when the officers and soldiers had left them in the lurch, they were so ashamed to stop in camp while the rest marched out, that they too set out, leaving only those above five-and-forty years of age.\n\nThese then stayed, while the rest set out on the march. Before they had gone two miles, they stumbled upon dead bodies, and when they had brought up the rear of the column in a line with the first bodies to be seen, they began digging graves and burying all included in the column from end to end. After burying the first batch, they advanced, and again bringing the rear even with the first unburied bodies which appeared, they buried in the same way all which the line of troops included. Finally, reaching the road that led out of the villages where the bodies lay thick together, they collected them and laid them in a common grave.\n\nIt was now about midday, when pushing forward the troops up to the villages without entering them, they proceeded to seize prvoisions, laying hands on everything they could set eyes on under cover of their 7 lines; when suddenly they caught sight of the enemy cresting certain hillocks in front of them, duly marshalled in line--a large body of cavalry and infantry. It was Spithridates and Rhathines, sent by Pharnabazus with their forec at their backs. As soon as the enemy caught sight of the Hellenes, they stood still, about two miles distant. Then Arexion the seer sacrificed, and at the first essay the victims were favourable. Whereupon Xenophon addressed the other generals: \"I would advise, sirs, that we should detach one or more flying columns to support our main attack, so that in case of need at any point we may have reserves in readiness to assist our main body, and the enemy, in the confusion of battle, may find himself attacking the unbroken lines of troops not hitherto engaged.\" These views approved themselves to all. \"Do you then,\" said he, \"lead on the vanguard straight at the enemy. Do not let us stand parleying here, now that we have caught sight of him and he of us. I will detach the hindmost companies in the way we have decided upon and follow you.\" After that they quietly advanced, and he, withdrawing the rear-rank companies in three brigades consisting of a couple of hundred men apiece, commissioned the first on the right to follow the main body at the distance of a hundred feet. Samolas the Achaean was in command of this brigade. The duty of the second, under the command of Pyrrhias the Arcadian, was to follow in the centre. The last was posted on the left, with Phrasias, an Athenian, in command. As they advanced, the vanguard reached a large and difficult woody glen, and halted, not knowing whether the obstacle needed to be crossed or not. They passed down the word for the generals and officers to come forward to the front. Xenophon, wondering what it was that stopped the march, and presently hearing the above order passed along the ranks, rode up with all speed. As soon as they were met, Sophaenetus, as the eldest general, stated his opinion that the question, whether a gully of that kind ought to be crossed or not, was not worth discussing. Xenophon, with some ardour, retorted: \"You know, sirs, I have not been in the habit hitherto of introducing you to danger which you might avoid. It is not your reputation for courage surely that is at stake, but your 14 safe return home. But now the matter stands thus: It is impossible to retire from this point without a battle; if we do not advance against the enemy ourselves, he will follow us as soon as we have turned our backs and attack us. Consider, then; is it better to go and meet the foe with arms advanced, or with arms reversed to watch him as he assails us on our rear? You know this at any rate, that to retire before an enemy has nothing glorious about it, whereas attack engenders courage even in a coward. For my part, I would rather at any time attack with half my men than retreat with twice the number. As to these fellows, if we attack them, I am sure you do not really expect them to await us; though, if we retreat, we know for certain they will be emboldened to pursue us. Nay, if the result of crossing is to place a difficult gully behind us when we are on the point of engaging, surely that is an advantage worth seizing. At least, if it were left to me, I would choose that everything should appear smooth and passable to the enemy, which may invite retreat; but for ourselves we may bless the ground which teaches us that except in victory we have no deliverance. It astonishes me that any one should deem this particular gully a whit more terrible than any of the other barriers which we have successfully passed. How impassable was the plain, had we failed to conquer their cavalry! how insurmountable the mountains already traversed by us, with all their peltasts in hot pursuit at our heels! Nay, when we have safely reached the sea, the Pontus will present a somewhat formidable gully, when we have neither vessels to convey us away nor corn to keep us alive whilst we stop. But we shall no sooner be there than we must be off again to get provisions. Surely it is better to fight to-day after a good breakfast than to-morrow on an empty stomach. Sirs, the offerings are favourable to us, the omens are propitious, the victims more than promising; let us attack the enemy! Now that they have had a good look at us, these fellows must not be allowed to enjoy their dinners or choose a camp at their own sweet will.\"\n\nAfter that the officers bade him lead on. None gainsaid, and he led the way. His orders were to cross the gully, where each man chanced to 22 find himself. By this method, as it seemed to him, the troops would more quickly mass themselves on the far side than was possible, if they defiled along the bridge which spanned the gully. But once across he passed along the line and addressed the troops: \"Sirs, call to mind what by help of the gods you have already done. Bethink you of the battles you have won at close quarters with the foe; of the fate which awaits those who flee before their foes. Forget not that we stand at the very doors of Hellas. Follow in the steps of Heracles, our guide, and cheer each the other onwards by name. Sweet were it surely by some brave and noble word or deed, spoken or done this day, to leave the memory of oneself in the hearts of those one loves.\"\n\n Lit. \"had they wound off thread by thread\"; the metaphor is from unwinding a ball of wool.\n\nThese words were spoken as he rode past, and simultaneously he began leading on the troops in battle line; and, placing the peltasts on either flank of the main body, they moved against the enemy. Along the line the order had sped \"to keep their spears at rest on the right shoulder until the bugle signal; then lower them for the charge, slow march, and even pace, no one to quicken into a run.\" Lastly, the watchword was passed, \"Zeus the Saviour, Heracles our Guide.\" The enemy waited their approach, confident in the excellence of his position; but as they drew closer the Hellene light troops, with a loud alala! without waiting for the order, dashed against the foe. The latter, on their side, came forward eagerly to meet the charge, both the cavalry and the mass of the Bithynians; and these turned the peltasts. But when with counter-wave the phalanx of the heavy infantry rapidly advancing, faced them, and at the same time the bugle sounded, and the battle hymn rose from all lips, and after this a loud cheer rose, and at the same instant they couched their spears;--at this conjuncture the enemy no longer welcomed them, but fled. Timasion with his cavalry followed close, and, considering their scant numbers, they did great execution. It was the left wing of the enemy, in a line with which the Hellene cavalry were posted, that was so speedily scattered. But the right, which was not so hotly pursued, collected upon a knoll; 28 and when the Hellenes saw them standing firm, it seemed the easiest and least dangerous course to go against them at once. Raising the battle hymn, they straightway fell upon them, but the others did not await their coming. Thereupon the peltasts gave chase until the right of the enemy was in its turn scattered, though with slight loss in killed; for the enemy's cavalry was numerous and threatening.\n\nBut when the Hellenes saw the cavalry of Pharnabazus still standing in compact order, and the Bithynian horsemen massing together as if to join it, and like spectators gazing down from a knoll at the occurrences below; though weary, they determined to attack the enemy as best they could, and not suffer him to recover breath with reviving courage. So they formed in compact line and advanced. Thereupon the hostile cavalry turned and fled down the steep as swiftly as if they had been pursued by cavalry. In fact they sought the shelter of a gully, the existence of which was unknown to the Hellenes. The latter accordingly turned aside too soon and gave up the chase, for it was too late. Returning to the point where the first encounter took place they erected a trophy, and went back to the sea about sunset. It was something like seven miles to camp.\n\nVI\n\nAfter this the enemy confined themselves to their own concerns, and 1 removed their households and property as far away as possible. The Hellenes, on their side, were still awaiting the arrival of Cleander with the ships of war and transports, which ought to be there soon. So each day they went out with the baggage animals and slaves and fearlessly brought in wheat and barley, wine and vegetables, millet and figs; since the district produced all good things, the olive alone excepted. When the army stayed in camp to rest, pillaging parties were allowed to go out, and those who went out appropriated the spoils; but when the whole army went out, if any one went off apart and seized 2 anything, it was voted to be public property. Ere long there was an ample abundance of supplies of all sorts, for marketables arrived from Hellenic cities on all sides, and marts were established. Mariners coasting by, and hearing that a city was being founded and that there was a harbour, were glad to put in. Even the hostile tribes dwelling in the neighbourhood presently began to send envoys to Xenophon. It was he who was forming the place into a city, as they understood, and they would be glad to learn on what terms they might secure his friendship. He made a point of introducing these visitors to the soldiers.\n\nMeanwhile Cleander arrived with two ships of war, but not a single transport. At the moment of his arrival, as it happened, the army had taken the field, and a separate party had gone off on a pillaging expedition into the hills and had captured a number of small cattle. In thir apprehension of being deprived of them, these same people spoke to Dexippus (this was the same man who had made off from Trapezus with the fifty-oared galley), and urged him to save their sheep for them. \"Take some for yourself,\" said they, \"and give the rest back to us.\" So, without more ado, he drove off the soldiers standing near, who kept repeating that the spoil was public property. Then off he went to Cleander. \"Here is an attempt,\" said he, \"at robbery.\" Cleander bade him to bring up the culprit to him. Dexippus seized on some one, and was for haling him to the Spartan governor. Just then Agasias came across him and rescued the man, who was a member of his company; and the rest of the soldiers present set to work to stone Dexippus, calling him \"traitor.\" Things looked so ill that a number of the crew of the ships of war took fright and fled to the sea, and with the rest Cleander himself. Xenophon and the other generals tried to hold the men back, assuring Cleander that the affair signified nothing at all, and that the origin of it was a decree pased by the army. That was to blame, if anything. But Cleander, goaded by Dexippus, and personally annoyed at the fright which he had experienced, threatened to sail away and publish an interdict against them, forbidding any city to receive them, as being public enemies. 9 For at this date the Lacedaemonians held sway over the whole Hellenic world.\n\nThereat the affair began to wear an ugly look, and the Hellenes begged and implored Cleander to reconsider his intention. He replied that he would be as good as his word, and that nothing should stop him, unless the man who set the example of stoning, with the other who rescued the prisoner, were given up to him. Now, one of the two whose persons were thus demanded--Agasias--had been a friend to Xenophon throughout; and that was just why Dexippus was all the more anxious to accuse him. In their perplexity the generals summoned a full meeting of the soldiers, and some speakers were disposed to make very light of Cleander and set him at naught. But Xenophon took a more serious view of the matter; he rose and addressed the meeting thus: \"Soldiers, I cannot say that I feel disposed to make light of this business, if Cleander be allowed to go away, as he threatens to do, in his present temper towards us. There are Hellenic cities close by; but then the Lacedaemonians are the lords of Hellas, and they can, any one of them, carry out whatever they like in the cities. If then the first thing this Lacedaemonian does is to close the gates of Byzantium, and next to pass an order to the other governors, city by city, not to receive us because we are a set of lawless ruffians disloyal to the Lacedaemonians; and if, further, this report of us should reach the ears of their admiral, Anaxibius, to stay or to sail away will alike be difficult. Remember, the Lacedaemonians at the present time are lords alike on land and on sea. For the sake then of a single man, or for two men's sake, it is not right that the rest of us should be debarred from Hellas; but whatever they enjoin we must obey. Do not the cities which gave us birth yield them obedience also? For my own part, inasmuch as Dexippus, I believe, keeps telling Cleander that Agasias would never have done this had not I, Xenophon, bidden him, I absolve you of all complicity, and Agasias too, if Agasias himself states that I am in any way a prime mover in this matter. If I have set the fashion of stone-throwing or any other sort of violence I condemn myself--I say that I deserve the extreme penalty, and I will submit to undergo it. I 15 further say that if any one else is accused, that man is bound to surrender himself to Cleander for judgement, for by this means you will be absolved entirely from the accusation. But as the matter now stands, it is cruel that just when we were aspiring to win praise and honour throughout Hellas, we are destined to sink below the level of the rest of the world, banned from the Hellenic cities whose common name we boast.\"\n\nAfter him Agasias got up, and said, \"I swear to you, sirs, by the gods and goddesses, verily and indeed, neither Xenophon nor any one else among you bade me rescue the man. I saw an honest man--one of my own company--being taken up by Dexippus, the man who betrayed you, as you know full well. That I could not endure; I rescued him, I admit the fact. Do not you deliver me up. I will surrender myself, as Xenophon suggests, to Cleander to pass what verdict on me he thinks right. Do not, for the sake of such a matter, make foes of the Lacedaemonians; rather God grant that each of you may safely reach the goal of his desire. Only do you choose from among yourselves and send with me to Cleander those who, in case of any omission on my part, may by their words and acts supply what is lacking.\" Thereupon the army granted him to choose for himself whom he would have go with him and to go; and he at once chose the generals. After this they all set off to Cleander--Agasias and the generals and the man who had been rescued by Agasias--and the generals spoke as follows: \"The army has sent us to you, Cleander, and this is their bidding: 'If you have fault to find with all, they say, you ought to pass sentence on all, and do with them what seems best; or if the charge is against one man or two, or possibly several, what they expect of these people is to surrender themselves to you for judgement.' Accordingly, if you lay anything to the charge of us generals, here we stand at your bar. Or do you impute the fault to some one not here? tell us whom. Short of flying in the face of our authority, there is no one who will absent himself.\"\n\n Reading with the best MSS., {sozoisthe}. Agasias ends his sentence with a prayer. Al. {sozesthe}, \"act so that each,\" etc.\n\nAt this point Agasias stepped forward and said: \"It was I, Cleander, 21 who rescued the man before you yonder from Dexippus, when the latter was carrying him off, and it was I who gave the order to strike Dexippus. My plea is that I know the prisoner to be an honest man. As to Dexippus, I know that he was chosen by the army to command a fifty-oared galley, which we had obtained by request from the men of Trapezus for the express purpose of collecting vessels to carry us safely home. But this same Dexippus betrayed his fellow-soldiers, with whom he had been delivered from so many perils, and made off into hiding like a runaway slave, whereby we have robbed the Trapezuntines of their frigate, and must needs appear as knaves in their eyes for this man's sake. As to ourselves, as far as he could, he has ruined us; for, like the rest of us, he had heard how all but impossible it was for us to retreat by foot across the rivers and to reach Hellas in safety. That is the stamp of man whom I robbed of his prey. Now, had it been you yourself who carried him off, or one of your emissaries, or indeed any one short of a runaway from ourselves, be sure that I should have acted far otherwise. Be assured that if you put me to death at this time you are sacrificing a good, honest man for the sake of a coward and a scamp.\"\n\nWhen he had listened to these remarks, Cleander replied that if such had been the conduct of Dexippus, he could not congratulate him. \"But still,\" he added, turning to the generals, \"were Dexippus ever so great a scamp he ought not to suffer violence; but in the language of your own demand he was entitled to a fair trial, and so to obtain his deserts. What I have to say at present therefore is: leave your friend here and go your way, and when I give the order be present at the trial. I have no further charge against the army or any one, since the prisoner himself admits that he rescued the man.\" Then the man who had been rescued said: \"In behalf of myself, Cleander, if possibly you think that I was being taken up for some misdeed, it is not so; I neither struck nor shot; I merely said, 'The sheep are public property;' for it was a resolution of the soldiers that whenever the army went out as a body any booty privately obtained was to be public property. That was all I said, and thereupon yonder fellow seized me 28 and began dragging me off. He wanted to stop our mouths, so that he might have a share of the things himself, and keep the rest for these buccaneers, contrary to the ordinance.\" In answer to that Cleander said: \"Very well, if that is your disposition you can stay behind too, and we will take your case into consideration also.\"\n\nThereupon Cleander and his party proceeded to breakfast; but Xenophon collected the army in assembly, and advised their sending a deputation to Cleander to intercede in behalf of the men. Accordingly it was resolved to send some generals and officers with Dracontius the Spartan, and of the rest those who seemed best fitted to go. The deputation was to request Cleander by all means to release the two men. Accordingly Xenophon came and addressed him thus: \"Cleander, you have the men; the army has bowed to you and assented to do what you wished with respect to these two members of their body and themselves in general. But now they beg and pray you to give up these two men, and not to put them to death. Many a good service have these two wrought for our army in past days. Let them but obtain this from you, and in return the army promises that, if you will put yourself at their head and the gracious gods approve, they will show you how orderly they are, how apt to obey their general, and, with heaven's help, to face their foes unflinchingly. They make this further request to you, that you will present yourself and take command of them and make trial of them. 'Test us ourselves,' they say, 'and test Dexippus, what each of us is like, and afterwards assign to each his due.'\" When Cleander heard these things, he answered: \"Nay, by the twin gods, I will answer you quickly enough. Here I make you a present of the two men, and I will as you say present myself, and then, if the gods vouchsafe, I will put myself at your head and lead you into Hellas. Very different is your language from the tale I used to hear concerning you from certain people, that you wanted to withdraw the army from allegiance to the Lacedaemonians.\"\n\nAfter this the deputation thanked him and retired, taking with them the two men; then Cleander sacrificed as a preliminary to marching and consorted friendlily with Xenophon, and the two struck up an alliance. 35 When the Spartan saw with what good discipline the men carried out their orders, he was still more anxious to become their leader. However, in spite of sacrifices repeated on three successive days, the victims steadily remained unfavourable. So he summoned the generals and said to them: \"The victims smile not on me, they suffer me not to lead you home; but be not out of heart at that. To you it is given, as it would appear, to bring your men safe home. Forwards then, and for our part, whenever you come yonder, we will bestow on you as warm a welcome as we may.\"\n\nThen the soldiers resolved to make him a present of the public cattle, which he accepted, but again gave back to them. So he sailed away; but the soldiers made division of the corn which they had collected and of the other captured property, and commenced their homeward march through the territory of the Bithynians.\n\nAt first they confined themselves to the main road; but not chancing upon anything whereby they might reach a friendly territory with something in their pockets for themselves, they resolved to turn sharp round, and marched for one day and night in the opposite direction. By this proceeding they captured many slaves and much small cattle; and on the sixth day reached Chrysopolis in Chalcedonia. Here they halted seven days while they disposed of their booty by sale.\n\n The name should be written \"Calchedonia.\" The false form drove out the more correct, probably through a mispronunciation, based on a wrong derivation, at some date long ago. The sites of Chrysopolis and Calchedon correspond respectively to the modern Scutari and Kadikoi.\n\n\nBOOK VII\n\n\n\nI\n\nAt this point Pharnabazus, who was afraid that the army might 1 undertake a campaign against his satrapy, sent to Anaxibius, the Spartan high admiral, who chanced to be in Byzantium, and begged him to convey the army out of Asia, undertaking to comply with his wishes in every respect. Anaxibius accordingly sent to summon the generals and officers to Byzantium, and promised that the soldiers should not lack pay for service, if they crossed the strait. The officers said that they would deliberate and return an answer. Xenophon individually informed them that he was about to quit the army at once, and was only anxious to set sail. Anaxibius pressed him not to be in so great a hurry: \"Cross over with the rest,\" he said, \"and then it will be time enough to think about quitting the army.\" This the other undertook to do.\n\nNow Seuthes the Thracian sent Medosades and begged Xenophon to use his influence to get the army across. \"Tell Xenophon, if he will do his best for me in this matter, he will not regret it.\" Xenophon answered: \"The army is in any case going to cross; so that, as far as that is concerned, Seuthes is under no obligation to me or to any one else; 6 but as soon as it is once across, I personally shall be quit of it. Let Seuthes, therefore, as far as he may deem consistent with prudence, apply to those who are going to remain and will have a voice in affairs.\"\n\nAfter this the whole body of troops crossed to Byzantium. But Anaxibius, instead of proceeding to give pay, made proclamation that, \"The soldiers were to take up their arms and baggage and go forth,\" as if all he wished were to ascertain their numbers and bid them god-speed at the same moment. The soldiers were not well pleased at that, because they had no money to furnish themselves with provisions for the march; and they sluggishly set about getting their baggage together. Xenophon meanwhile, being on terms of intimacy with the governor, Cleander, came to pay his host a final visit, and bid him adieu, being on the point of setting sail. But the other protested; \"Do not do so, or else,\" said he, \"you will be blamed, for even now certain people are disposed to hold you to account because the army is so slow in getting under weigh.\" The other answered, \"Nay, I am not to blame for that. It is the men themselves, who are in want of provisions; that is why they are out of heart at their exodus.\" \"All the same,\" he replied, \"I advise you to go out, as if you intended to march with them, and when you are well outside, it will be time enough to take yourself off.\" \"Well then,\" said Xenophon, \"we will go and arrange all this with Anaxibius.\" They went and stated the case to the admiral, who insisted that they must do as he had said, and march out, bag and baggage, by the quickest road; and as an appendix to the former edict, he added, \"Any one absenting himself from the review and the muster will have himself to blame for the consequences.\" This was peremptory. So out marched, the generals first, and then the rest; and now, with the exception of here a man and there, they were all outside; it was a \"clean sweep\"; and Eteonicus stood posted near the gates, ready to close them, as soon as the men were fairly out, and to thrust in the bolt pin.\n\nThen Anaxibius summoned the generals and captains, and addressed them: \"Provisions you had better get from the Thracian villages; you will 13 find plenty of barley, wheat, and other necessaries in them; and when you have got them, off with you to the Chersonese, where Cyniscus will take you into his service.\" Some of the soldiers overheard what was said, or possibly one of the officers was the medium of communication; however it was, the news was handed on to the army. As to the generals, their immediate concern was to try and gain some information as to Seuthes: \"Was he hostile or friendly? also, would they have to march through the Sacred mountain, or round about through the middle of Thrace?\"\n\n So the mountain-range is named which runs parallel to the Propontis (Sea of Marmora) from lat. 41 degress N. circa to lat. 40 degrees 30'; from Bisanthe (Rhodosto) to the neck of the Chersonese (Gallipoli).\n\nWhile they were discussing these points, the soldiers snatched up their arms and made a rush full speed at the gates, with the intention of getting inside the fortification again. But Eteonicus and his men, seeing the heavy infantry coming up at a run promptly closed the gates and thrust in the bolt pin. Then the soldiers fell to battering the gates, exclaiming that it was iniquitous to thrust them forth in this fashion into the jaws of their enemies. \"If you do not of your own accord open the gates,\" they cried, \"we will split them in half\"; and another set rushed down to the sea, and so along the break-water and over the wall into the city; while a third set, consisting of those few who were still inside, having never left the city, seeing the affair at the gates, severed the bars with axes and flung the portals wide open; and the rest came pouring in.\n\nXenophon, seeing what was happening, was seized with alarm lest the army betake itself to pillage, and ills incurable be wrought to the city, to himself, and to the soldiers. Then he set off, and, plunging into the throng, was swept through the gates with the crowd. The Byzantines no sooner saw the soldiers forcibly rushing in than they left the open square, and fled, some to the shipping, others to their homes, while those already indoors came racing out, and some fell to dragging down their ships of war, hoping possibly to be safe on board these; while there was not a soul who doubted but that the city was 19 taken, and that they were all undone. Eteonicus made a swift retreat to the citadel. Anaxibius ran down to the sea, and, getting on board a fisherman's smack, sailed round to the acropolis, and at once sent off to fetch over the garrison troops from Chalcedon, since those already in the acropolis seemed hardly sufficient to keep the men in check.\n\nThe soldiers, catching sight of Xenophon, threw themselves upon him, crying: \"Now, Xenophon, is the time to prove yourself a man. You have got a city, you have got triremes, you have got money, you have got men; to-day, if you only chose, you can do us a good turn, and we will make you a great man.\" He replied: \"Nay, I like what you say, and I will do it all; but if that is what you have set your hearts on, fall into rank and take up position at once.\" This he said, wishing to quiet them, and so passed the order along the lines himself, while bidding the rest to do the same: \"Take up position; stand easy.\" But the men themselves, by a species of self-marshalling, fell into rank, and were soon formed, the heavy infantry eight deep, while the light infantry had run up to cover either wing. The Thracian Square, as it is called, is a fine site for manouvering, being bare of buildings and level. As soon as the arms were stacked and the men's tempers cooled, Xenophon called a general meeting of the soldiers, and made the following speech:--\n\n\"Soldiers, I am not surprised at your wrath, or that you deem it monstrous treatment so to be cheated; but consider what will be the consequences if we gratify our indignation, and in return for such deception, avenge ourselves on the Lacedaemonians here present, and plunder an innocent city. We shall be declared enemies of the Lacedaemonians and their allies; and what sort of war that will be, we need not go far to conjecture. I take it, you have not forgotten some quite recent occurrences. We Athenians entered into war against the Lacedaemonians and their allies with a fleet consisting of not less than three hundred line-of-battle ships, including those in dock as well as those afloat. We had vast treasures stored up in the city, and a yearly income which, derived from home or foreign sources, amounted to no less than a thousand talents. Our empire included all the 27 islands, and we were possessed of numerous cities both in Asia and in Europe. Amongst others, this very Byzantium, where we are now, was ours; and yet in the end we were vanquished, as you all very well know.\n\n\"What, must we anticipate, will now be our fate? The Lacedaemonians have not only their old allies, but the Athenians and those who were at that time allies of Athens are added to them. Tissaphernes and all the rest of the Asiatics on the seaboard are our foes, not to speak of our arch-enemy, the king himself, up yonder, whom we came to deprive of his empire, and to kill, if possible. I ask then, with all these banded together against us, is there any one so insensate as to imagine that we can survive the contest? For heaven's sake, let us not go mad or loosely throw away our lives in war with our own native cities--nay, our own friends, our kith and our kin; for in one or other of the cities they are all included. Every city will march against us, and not unjustly, if, after refusing to hold one single barbarian city by right of conquest, we seize the first Hellenic city that we come to and make it a ruinous heap. For my part, my prayer is that before I see such things wrought by you, I, at any rate, may lie ten thousand fathoms under ground! My counsel to you, as Hellenes, is to try and obtain your just rights, through obedience to those who stand at the head of Hellas; and if so be that you fail in those demands, why, being more sinned against than sinning, need we rob ourselves of Hellas too? At present, I propose that we should send to Anaxibius and tell him that we have made an entrance into the city, not meditating violence, but merely to discover if he and his will show us any good; for if so, it is well; but of otherwise, at least we will let him see that he does not shut the door upon us as dupes and fools. We know the meaning of discipline; we turn our backs and go.\"\n\nThis resolution was passed, and they sent Hieronymus an Eleian, with two others, Eurylochus an Arcadian and Philesius an Achaean, to deliver the message. So these set off on their errand. But while the soldiers were still seated in conclave, Coeratadas, of Thebes, 33 arrived. He was a Theban not in exile, but with a taste for generalship, who made it his business to see if any city or nation were in need of his services. Thus, on the present occasion, he presented himself, and begged to state that he was ready to put himself at their head, and lead them into the Delta of Thrace, as it is called, where they would find themselves in a land of plenty; but until they got there, he would provide them with meat and drink enough and to spare. While they were still listening to this tale, the return message from Anaxibius came. His answer was: \"The discipline, they had spoken of, was not a thing they would regret; indeed he would report their behaviour to the authorities at home; and for himself, he would take advice and do the best he could for them.\"\n\n The exact locality, so called, is not known; doubtless it lay somewhere between Byzantium and Salmydessus, possibly at Declus (mod. Derkos); or possibly the narrow portion of Thrace between the Euxine, Bosphorus, and Propontis went by this name. See note in Pretor ad. loc., and \"Dict. Geog.\" \"Thracia.\"\n\nThereupon the soldiers accepted Coeratadas as their general, and retired without the walls. Their new general undertook to present himself to the troops next day with sacrificial beasts and a soothsayer, with eatables also and drinkables for the army. Now, as soon as they were gone out, Anaxibius closed the gates and issued a proclamation to the effect that \"any of the soldiers caught inside should be knocked down to the hammer and sold at once.\" Next day, Coeratadas arrived with the victims and the soothsayer. A string of twenty bearers bearing barleymeal followed at his heels, succeeded by other twenty carrying wine, and three laden with a supply of olives, and two others carrying, the one about as much garlic as a single man could lift, and the other a similar load of onions. These various supplies he set down, apparently for distribution, and began to sacrifice.\n\nNow Xenophon sent to Cleander, begging him to arrange matters so that he might be allowed to enter the walls, with a view to starting from Byzantium on his homeward voyage. Cleander came, and this is what he 39 said: \"I have come; but I was barely able to arrange what you want. Anaxibius insisted: 'It was not convenient that Xenophon should be inside while the soldiers are close to the walls without; the Byzantines at sixes and sevens moreover; and no love lost between the one party of them and the other.' Still, he ended by bidding you to come inside, if you were really minded to leave the town by sea with himself.\" Accordingly Xenophon bade the soldiers good-bye, and returned with Cleander within the walls.\n\nTo return to Coeratadas. The first day he failed to get favourable signs at the sacrifice, and never a dole of rations did he make to the soldiers. On the second day the victims were standing ready near the altar, and so was Coeratadas, with chaplet crowned, all ready to sacrifice, when up comes Timasion the Dardanian, with Neon the Asinaean, and Cleanor of Orchomenus, forbidding Coeratadas to sacrifice: \"He must understand there was an end to his generalship, unless he gave them provisions.\" The other bade them measure out the supplies, \"Pray, dole them out.\" But when he found that he had a good deal short of a single day's provisions for each man, he picked up his paraphernalia of sacrifice and withdrew. As to being general, he would have nothing more to say to it.\n\nII\n\nNow these five were left--Neon the Asinaean, Phryniscus the Achaean, 1 Philesius the Achaean, Xanthicles the Achaean, Timasion the Dardanian--at the head of the army, and they pushed on to some villages of the Thracians facing Byzantium, and there encamped. Now the generals could not agree. Cleanor and Phryniscus wished to march to join Seuthes, who had worked upon their feelings by presenting one with a horse and the other with a woman to wife. But Neon's object was to come to the Chersonese: \"When we are under the wing of the Lacedaemonians,\" he thought, \"I shall step to the front and command the whole army.\"\n\nTimasion's one ambition was to cross back again into Asia, hoping to be reinstated at home and end his exile. The soldiers shared the wishes of the last general. But, as time dragged on, many of the men sold their arms at different places and set sail as best they could; others ] 3 became absorbed in the cities. One man rejoiced. This was Anaxibius, to whom the break-up of the army was a blessing. \"That is the way,\" he said to himself, \"I can best gratify Pharnabazus.\"\n\n The MSS. give the words so rendered--{oi de kai }, which some critics emend {diadidontes}, others bracket as suspected, others expunge.\n\nBut Anaxibius, while prosecuting his voyage from Byzantium, was met at Cyzicus by Aristarchus, the new governor, who was to succeed Cleander at Byzantium; and report said that a new admiral, Polus, if he had not actually arrived, would presently reach the Hellespont and relieve Anaxibius. The latter sent a parting injunction to Aristarchus to be sure and sell all the Cyreian soldiers he could lay hands on still lingering in Byzantium; for Cleander had not sold a single man of them; on the contrary, he had made it his business to tend the sick and wounded, pitying them, and insisting on their being received in the houses. Aristarchus changed all that, and was no sooner arrived in Byzantium than he sold no less than four hundred of them. Meanwhile Anaxibius, on his coasting voyage, reached Parium, and, according to the terms of their agreement, he sent to Pharnabazus. But the latter, learning that Aristarchus was the new governor at Byzantim, and that Anixibius had ceased to be admiral, turned upon him a cold shoulder, and set out concocting the same measures concerning the Cyreian army with Aristarchus, as he had lately been at work upon with Anaxibius.\n\nAnaxibius thereupon summoned Xenophon and bade him, by every manner of means, sail to the army with the utmost speed, and keep it together. \"He was to collect the scattered fragments and march them down to Perinthus, and thence convey them across to Asia without loss of time.\" And herewith he put a thirty-oared galley at his srrvice, and gave him a letter of authority and an officer to accompany him, with an order to the Perinthians \"to escort Xenophon without delay on horseback to the army.\" So it was that Xenophon sailed across and eventually reached the army. The soldiers gave him a joyous welcome, and would have been only too glad to cross from Thrace into Asia under his leadership.\n\nBut Seuthes, hearing that Xenophon had arrived, sent Medosades again, 10 by sea to meet him, and begged him to bring the army to him; and whatever he thought would make his speech persuasive, he was ready to promise him. But the other replied, that none of these things were open to him to do; and with this answer Medosades departed, and the Hellenes proceeded to Perinthus. Here on arrival Neon withdrew his troops and encamped apart, having about eight hundred men; while the remainder of the army lay in one place under the walls of Perinthus.\n\nAfter this, Xenophon set himself to find vessels, so as to lose no time in crossing. But in the interval Aristarchus, the governor from Byzantium, arrived with a couple of war-ships, being moved to do so by Pharnabazus. To make doubly sure, he first forbade the skippers and shipmasters to carry the troops across, and then he visited the camp and informed the soldiers that their passage into Asia was forbidden. Xenophon replied that he was acting under the orders of Anaxibius, who had sent him thither for this express purpose; to which Aristarchus retorted, \"For the matter of that, Anaxibius is no longer admiral, and I am governor in this quarter; if I catch any of you at sea, I will sink you.\" With these remarks he retired within the walls of Perinthus.\n\nNext day, he sent for the generals and officers of the army. They had already reached the fortification walls, when some one brought word to Xenophon that if he set foot inside, he would be seized, and either meet some ill fate there or more likely be delivered up to Pharnabazus. On hearing this Xenophon sent forward the rest of the party, but for himself pleaded that there was a sacrifice which he wished to offer. In this way he contrived to turn back and consult the victims, \"Would the gods allow him to try and bring the army over to Seuthes?\" On the one hand it was plain that the idea of crossing over to Asia in the face of this man with his ships of war, who meant to bar the passage, was too dangerous. Nor did he altogether like the notion of being blocked up in the Chersonese with an army in dire need of everything; where, besides being at the beck and call of the 15 governor of the place, they would be debarred from the necessities of life.\n\nWhile Xenophon was thus employed, the generals and officers came back with a message from Aristarchus, who had told them they might retire for the present, but in the afternoon he would expect them. The former suspicions of a plot had now ripened to a certainty. Xenophon meantime had ascertained that the victims were favourable to his project. He personally, and the army as a whole, might with safety proceed to Seuthes, they seemed to say. Accordingly, he took with him Polycrates, the Athenian captain, and from each of the generals, not including Neon, some one man whom they could in each case trust, and in the night they set off to visit the army of Seuthes, sixty furlongs distant.\n\nAs they approached, they came upon some deserted watch-fires, and their first impression was that Seuthes had shifted his position; but presently perceiving a confused sound (the voices of Seuthes' people signalling to one another), the explanation dawned on him: Seuthes kept his watch-fires kindled in front of, instead of behind, his night pickets, in order that the outposts, being in the dark, might escape notice, their numbers and position thus being a mystery; whilst any party approaching from the outside, so far from escaping notice, would, through the glare of the fire, stand out conspicuously. Perceiving how matters stood, Xenophon sent forward his interpreter, who was one of the party, and bade him inform Seuthes that Xenophon was there and craved conference with him. The others asked if he were an Athenian from the army yonder, and no sooner had the interpreter replied, \"Yes, the same,\" than up they leapt and galloped off; and in less time than it takes to tell a couple of hundred peltasts had come up who seized and carried off Xenophon and those with him and brought them to Seuthes. The latter was in a tower right well guarded, and there were horses round it in a circle, standing all ready bitted and bridled; for his alarm was so great that he gave his horses their provender during the day, and during the nights he kept watch and 21 ward with the brutes thus bitted and bridled. It was stated in explanation that in old days an ancestor of his, named Teres, had been in this very country with a large army, several of whom he had lost at the hands of the native inhabitants, besides being robbed of his baggage train. The inhabitants of the country are Thynians, and they are reputed to be far the most warlike set of fighters--especially at night.\n\n I.e. \"instead of letting them graze.\"\n\nWhen they drew near, Seuthes bade Xenophon enter, and bring with him any two he might choose. As soon as they were inside, they first greeted one another warmly, and then, according to the Thracian custom, pledged themselves in bowls of wine. There was further present at the elbow of Seuthes, Medosades, who on all occasions acted as his ambassador-in-chief. Xenophon took the initiative and spoke as follows: \"You have sent to me, Seuthes, once and again. On the first occasion you sent Medosades yonder, to Chalcedon, and you begged me to use my influence in favour of the army crossing over from Asia. You promised me, in return for this conduct on my part, various kindnesses; at least that is what Medosades stated\"; and before proceeding further he turned to Medosades and asked, \"Is not that so?\" The other assented. \"Again, on a second occasion, the same Medosades came when I had crossed over from Parium to rejoin the army; and he promised me that if I would bring you the army, you would in various respects treat me as a friend and brother. He said especially with regard to certain seaboard places of which you are the owner and lord, that you were minded to make me a present of them.\" At this point he again questioned Medosades, \"Whether the words attributed to him were exact?\" and Medosades once more fully assented. \"Come now,\" proceeded Xenophon, \"recount what answer I made you, and first at Chalcedon.\" \"You answered that the army was, in any case, about to cross over to Byzantium; and as far as that went, there was no need to pay you or any one else anything; and for yourself, you added, that once across you were minded to leave the army, which thing came to pass even as you said.\" \"Well! what did I say,\" he asked, \"at your next visit, when 28 you came to me in Selybria?\" \"You said that the proposal was impossible; you were all going to Perinthus to cross into Asia.\" \"Good,\" said Xenophon, \"and in spite of it all, at the present moment, here I am myself, and Phryniscus, one of my colleagues, and Polycrates yonder, a captain; and outside, to represent the other generals (all except Neon the Laconian), the trustiest men they could find to send. So that if you wish to give these transactions the seal of still greater security, you have nothing to do but to summon them also; and do you, Polycrates, go and say from me, that I bid them leave their arms outside, and you can leave your own sword outside before you enter with them on your return.\"\n\nWhen Seuthes had heard so far, he interposed: \"I should never mistrust an Athenian, for we are relatives already, I know; and the best of friends, I believe, we shall be.\" After that, as soon as the right men entered, Xenophon first questioned Seuthes as to what use he intended to make of the army, and he replied as follows: \"Maesades was my father; his sway extended over the Melanditae, the Thynians, and the Tranipsae. Then the affairs of the Odrysians took a bad turn, and my father was driven out of this country, and later on died himself of sickness, leaving me to be brought up as an orphan at the court of Medocus, the present king. But I, when I had grown to man's estate, could not endure to live with my eyes fixed on another's board. So I seated myself on the seat by him as a suppliant, and begged him to give me as many men as he could spare, that I might wreak what mischief I could on those who had driven us forth from our land; that thus I might cease to live in dependence upon another's board, like a dog watching his master's hand. In answer to my petition, he gave me 34 the men and the horses which you will see at break of day, and nowadays I live with these, pillaging my own ancestral land. But if you would join me, I think, with the help of heaven, we might easily recover my empire. That is what I want of you.\" \"Well then,\" said Xenophon, \"supposing we came, what should you be able to give us? the soldiers, the officers, and the generals? Tell us that these witnesses may report your answer.\" And he promised to give \"to the common soldiers a cyzicene, to a captain twice as much, and to a general four times as much, with as much land as ever they liked, some yoke of oxen, and a fortified place upon the seaboard.\" \"But now supposing,\" said Xenophon, \"we fail of success, in spite of our endeavours; suppose any intimidation on the part of the Lacedaemonians should arise; will you receive into your country any of us who may seek to find a refuge with you?\" He answered: \"Nay, not only so, but I shall look upon you as my brothers, entitled to share my seat, and the joint possessors of all the wealth which we may be able to acquire. And to you yourself, O Xenophon! I will give my daughter, and if you have a daughter, I will buy her in Thracian fashion; and I will give you Bisanthe as a dwelling-place, which is the fairest of all my possessions on the seaboard.\"\n\n Tradition said that the Thracians and Athenians were connected, through the marriage of a former prince Tereus (or Teres) with Procne, the daughter of Pandion. This old story, discredited by Thucydides, ii. 29, is referred to in Arist. \"Birds,\" 368 foll. The Birds are about to charge the two Athenian intruders, when Epops, king of the Birds, formerly Tereus, king of Thrace, but long ago transformed into a hoopoe, intercedes in behalf of two men, {tes emes gunaikos onte suggene kai phuleta}, \"who are of my lady's tribe and kin.\" As a matter of history, the Athenians had in the year B.C. 431 made alliance with Sitalces, king of the Odrysians (the son of Teres, the first founder of their empire), and made his son, Sadocus, an Athenian citizen. Cf. Thuc. ib.; Arist. Acharnians, 141 foll.\n\n A cyzicene monthly is to be understood.\n\n Bisanthe, one of the Ionic colonies founded by Samos, with the Thracian name Rhaedestus (now Rodosto), strongly placed so as to command the entrance into the Sacred mountain.\n\nIII\n\nAfter listening to these proposals, they gave and accepted pledges of 1 good faith; and so the deputation rode off. Before day they were back again in camp, and severally rendered a report to those who sent them. At dawn Aristarchus again summoned the generals and officers, but the latter resolved to have done with the visit to Aristarchus, and to summon a meeting of the army. In full conclave the soldiers met, with the exception of Neon's men, who remained about ten furlongs off. When they were met together Xenophon rose, and made the following announcement: \"Men, Aristarchus with his ships of war hinders us from sailing where we fain would go; it is not even safe to set foot on 3 board a vessel. But if he hinders us here, he hastens us there. 'Be off to the Chersonese,' says he, 'force a passage through the Sacred mountain.' If we master it and succeed in getting to that place, he has something in store for us. He promises that he will not sell you any more, as he did at Byzantium; you shall not be cheated again; you shall have pay; he will no longer, as now, suffer you to remain in want of provisions. That is his proposal. But Seuthes says that if you will go to him he will treat you well. What you have now to consider is, whether you will stay to debate this question, or leave its settlement till we have gone up into a land of provisions. If you ask me my opinion, it is this: Since here we have neither money to buy, nor leave to take without money what we need, why should we not go up into these villages where the right to help ourselves is conferred by might? There, unhampered by the want of bare necessaries, you can listen to what this man and the other wants of you and choose whichever sounds best. Let those,\" he added, \"who agree to this, hold up their hands.\" They all held them up. \"Retire then,\" said he, \"and get your kit together, and at the word of command, follow your leader.\"\n\nAfter this, Xenophon put himself at the head and the rest followed. Neon, indeed, and other agents from Aristarchus tried to turn them from their purpose, but to their persuasions they turned a deaf ear. They had not advanced much more than three miles, when Seuthes met them; and Xenophon, seeing him, bade him ride up. He wished to tell him what they felt to be conducive to their interests, and in the presence of as many witnesses as possible. As soon as he had approached, Xenophon said: \"We are going where the troops will have enough to live upon; when we are there, we will listen to you and to the emissaries of the Laconian, and choose between you both whatever seems best. If then you will lead us where provisions are to be got in plenty, we shall feel indebted to you for your hospitality.\" And Seuthes answered: \"For the matter of that, I know many villages, close-packed and stocked with all kinds of provisions, just far enough 9 off to give you a good appetite for your breakfasts.\" \"Lead on then!\" said Xenophon. When they had reached the villages in the afternoon, the soldiers met, and Seuthes made the following speech: \"My request to you, sirs, is that you will take the field with me, and my promise to you is that I will give every man of you a cyzicene, and to the officers and generals at the customary rate; besides this I will honour those who show special merit. Food and drink you shall get as now for yourselves from the country; but whatever is captured, I shall claim to have myself, so that by distribution of it I may provide you with pay. Let them flee, let them creep into hiding-places, we shall be able to pursue after them, we will track them out; or if they resist, along with you we will endeavour to subdue them to our hands.\" Xenophon inquired: \"And how far from the sea shall you expect the army to follow you?\" \"Nowhere more than seven days' journey,\" he answered, \"and in many places less.\"\n\nAfter this, permission was given for all who wished to speak, and many spoke, but ever to one and the same tune: \"What Seuthes said, was very right. It was winter, and for a man to sail home, even if he had the will to do so, was impossible. On the other hand, to continue long in a friendly country, where they must depend upon what they could purchase, was equally beyond their power. If they were to wear away time and support life in a hostile country, it was safer to do so with Seuthes than by themselves, not to speak of all these good things; but if they were going to get pay into the bargain, that indeed was a godsend.\" To complete the proceedings, Xenophon said: \"If any one opposes the measure, let him state his views; if not, let the officer put the proposition to the vote.\" No one opposed; they put it to the vote, and the resolution was carried; and without loss of time, he informed Seuthes that they would take the field with him.\n\nAfter this the troops messed in their separate divisions, but the generals and officers were invited by Seuthes to dinner at a neighbouring village which was in his possession. When they were at the doors, and on the point of stepping in to dinner, they were met by 16 a certain Heracleides, of Maronea. He came up to each guest, addressing himself particularly to those who, as he conjectured, ought to be able to make a present to Seuthes. He addressed himself first to some Parians who were there to arrange a friendship with Medocus, the king of the Odrysians, and were bearers of presents to the king and to his wife. Heracleides reminded them: \"Medocus is up country twelve days' journey from the sea; but Seuthes, now that he has got this army, will be lord on the sea-coast; as your neighbour, then, he is the man to do you good or do you ill. If you are wise, you will give him whatever he askes of you. On the whole, it will be laid out at better interest than if you have it to Medocus, who lives so far off.\" That was his mode of persuasion in their case. Next he came to Timasion the Dardanian, who, some one had told him, was the happy possessor of certain goblets and oriental carpets. What he said to him was: \"It is customary when people are invited to dinner by Seuthes for the guests to make him a present; now if he should become a great person in these parts, he will be able to restore you to your native land, or to make you a rich man here.\" Such were the solicitations which he applied to each man in turn whom he accosted. Presently he came to Xenophon and said: \"You are at once a citizen of no mean city, and with Seuthes also your own name is very great. Maybe you expect to obtain a fort or two in this country, just as others of your countrymen have done, and territory. It is only right and proper therefore that you should honour Seuthes in the most magnificent style. Be sure, I give this advice out of pure friendliness, for I know that the greater the gift that you are ready to bestow on him, the better the treatment you will receive at his hands.\" Xenophon, on hearing this, was in a sad dilemma, for he had brought with him, when he crossed from Parium, nothing but one boy and just enough to pay his travelling expenses.\n\n A Greek colony in Thrace. Among Asiatico-Ionian colonies were Abdera, founded by Teos, and Maroneia, celebrated for its wine, founded by Chios about 540 B.C.--Kiepert, \"Man. Anct. Geog.\" viii. 182.\n\n Notably Alcibiades, who possessed two or three such fortresses.\n\nAs soon as the company, consisting of the most powerful Thracians 21 there present, with the generals and captains of the Hellenes, and any embassy from a state which might be there, had arrived, they were seated in a circle, and the dinner was served. Thereupon three-legged stools were brought in and placed in front of the assembled guests. They were laden with pieces of meat, piled up, and there were huge leavened-loaves fastened on to the pieces of meat with long skewers. The tables, as a rule, were set beside the guests at intervals. That was the custom; and Seuthes set the fashion of the performance. He took up the loaves which lay by his side and broke them into little pieces, and then threw the fragments here to one and there to another as seemed to him good; and so with the meat likewise, leaving for himself the merest taste. Then the rest fell to following the fashion set them, those that is who had tables placed beside them.\n\nNow there was an Arcadian, Arystas by name, a huge eater; he soon got tired of throwing the pieces about, and seized a good three-quarters loaf in his two hands, placed some pieces of meat upon his knees, and proceeded to discuss his dinner. Then beakers of wine were brought round, and every one partook in turn; but when the cupbearer came to Arystas and handed him the bowl, he looked up, and seeing that Xenophon had done eating: \"Give it him,\" quoth he, \"he is more at leisure. I have something better to do at present.\" Seuthes, hearing a remark, asked the cupbearer what was said, and the cupbearer, who knew how to talk Greek, explained. Then followed a peal of laughter.\n\nWhen the drinking had advanced somewhat, in came a Thracian with a white horse, who snatched the brimming bowl and said: \"Here's a health to thee, O Seuthes! Let me present thee with this horse. Mounted on him, thou shalt capture whom thou choosest to pursue, or retiring from battle, thou shalt not dread the foe.\" He was followed by one who brought in a boy, and presented him in proper style with \"Here's a health to thee, O Seuthes!\" A third had \"clothes for his wife.\" Timasion, the Dardanian, pledged Seuthes, and presented a silver bowl and a carpet worth ten minae. Gnesippus, an Athenian, got up 28 and said: \"It was a good old custom, and a fine one too, that those who had, should give to the king for honour's sake, but to those who had not, the king should give; whereby, my lord,\" he added, \"I too may one day have the wherewithal to give thee gifts and honour.\" Xenophon the while was racking his brains what he was to do; he was not the happier because he was seated in the seat next Seuthes as a mark of honour; and Heracleides bade the cupbearer hand him the bowl. The wine had perhaps a little mounted to his head; he rose, and manfully seized the cup, and spoke: \"I also, Seuthes, have to present you with myself and these my dear comrades to be your trusty friends, and not one of them against his will. They are more ready, one and all, still more than I, to be your friends. Here they are; they ask nothing from you in return, rather they are forward to labour in your behalf; it will be their pleasure to bear the brunt of battle in voluntary service. With them, God willing, you will gain vast territory; you will recover what was once your forefathers'; you will win for yourself new lands; and not lands only, but horses many, and of men a multitude, and many a fair dame besides. You will not need to seize upon them in robber fashion; it is your friends here who, of their own accord, shall take and bring them to you, they shall lay them at your feet as gifts.\" Up got Seuthes and drained with him the cup, and with him sprinkled the last drops fraternally.\n\n Or rather \"saucer\" ({phiale}).\n\n For the Thracian custom, vide Suidas, s.v. {kataskedazein}.\n\nAt this stage entered musicians blowing upon horns such as they use for signal calls, and trumpeting on trumpets, made of raw oxhide, tunes and airs, like the music of the double-octave harp. Seuthes himself got up and shouted, trolling forth a war song; then he sprang from his place and leapt about as though he would guard himself against a missile, in right nimble style. Then came in a set of clowns and jesters.\n\n Or, \"magadis.\" This is said to have been one of the most perfect instruments. It comprised two full octaves, the left hand playing the same notes as the right an octave lower. Guhl and Koner, p. 203, Engl. transl. See also \"Dict. Antiq.\" \"Musica\"; and Arist. \"Polit.\" xix. 18, {Dia ti e dia pason sumphonia adetai mone; magasizousi gar tauten, allen de oudemian}, i.e. \"since no interval except the octave ({dia pason}) could be 'magidised' (the effect of any other is well known to be intolerable), therefore no other interval was employed at all.\"\n\nBut when the sun began to set, the Hellenes rose from their seats. It 33 was time, they said, to place the night sentinels and to pass the watchword; further, they begged of Seuthes to issue an order that none of the Thracians were to enter the Hellenic camp at night, \"since between your Thracian foes and our Thracian friends there might be some confusion.\" As they sallied forth, Seuthes rose to accompany them, like the soberest of men. When they were outside, he summoned the generals apart and said: \"Sirs, our enemies are not aware as yet of our alliance. If, therefore, we attack them before they take precautions not to be caught, or are prepared to repel assault, we shall make a fine haul of captives and other stock.\" The generals fully approved of these views, and bade him lead on. He answered: \"Prepare and wait; as soon as the right time comes I will be with you. I shall pick up the peltasts and yourselves, and with the help of the gods, I will lead on.\" \"But consider one point,\" urged Xenophon; \"if we are to march by night, is not the Hellenic fashion best? When marching in the daytime that part of the army leads the van which seems best suited to the nature of the country to be traversed--heavy or light infantry, or cavalry; but by night our rule is that the slowest arm should take the lead. Thus we avoid the risk of being pulled to pieces: and it is not so easy for a man to give his neighbour the slip without intending, whereas the scattered fragments of an army are apt to fall foul of one another, and to cause damage or incur it in sheer ignorance.\" To this Seuthes replied: \"You reason well, and I will adopt your custom. I will furnish you with guides chosen from the oldest experts of the country, and I will myself follow with the cavalry in the rear; it will not take me long, if need be, to present myself at the front.\" Then, for kinship's sake, they chose \"Athenaia\" as their watchword. With this, they turned and sought repose.\n\n \"Our Lady of Athens.\"\n\nIt was about midnight when Seuthes presented himself with his cavalry troopers armed with corselets, and his light infantry under arms. As 40 soon as he had handed over to them the promised guides, the heavy infantry took the van, followed by the light troops in the centre, while the cavalry brought up the rear. At daybreak Seuthes rode up to the front. He complimented them on their method: so often had he himself, while marching by night with a mere handful of men, been separated with his cavalry from his infantry. \"But now,\" said he, \"we find ourselves at dawn of day all happily together, just as we ought to be. Do you wait for me here,\" he proceeded, \"and recruit yourselves. I will take a look round and rejoin you.\" So saying he took a certain path over hill and rode off. As soon as he had reached deep snow, he looked to see whether there were footprints of human beings leading forward or in the opposite direction; and having satisfied himself that the road was untrodden, back he came, exclaiming: \"God willing, sirs, it will be all right; we shall fall on the fellows, before they know where they are. I will lead on with the cavalry; so that if we catch sight of any one, he shall not escape and give warning to the enemy. Do you follow, and if you are left behind, keep to the trail of the horses. Once on the other side of the mountains, we shall find ourselves in numerous thriving villages.\"\n\nBy the middle of the day he had already gained the top of the pass and looked down upon the villages below. Back he came riding to the heavy infantry and said: \"I will at once send off the cavalry into the plain below, and the peltasts too, to attack the villages. Do you follow with what speed you may, so that in case of resistance you may lend us your aid.\" Hearing this, Xenophon dismounted, and the other asked: \"Why do you dismount just when speed is the thing we want?\" The other answered: \"But you do not want me alone, I am sure. The hoplites will run all the quicker and more cheerily if I lead them on foot.\"\n\nThereupon Seuthes went off, and Timasion with him, taking the Hellene squadron of something like forty troopers. Then Xenophon passed the order: the active young fellows up to thirty years of age from the different companies to the front; and off with these he went himself, bowling along; while Cleanor led the other Hellenes. When they had 46 reached the villages, Seuthes, with about thirty troopers, rode up, exclaiming: \"Well, Xenophon, this is just what you said! the fellows are caught, but now look here. My cavalry have gone off unsupported; they are scattered in pursuit, one here, one there, and upon my word, I am more than half afraid the enemy will collect somewhere and do them a mischief. Some of us must remain in the villages, for they are swarming with human beings.\" \"Well then,\" said Xenophon, \"I will seize the heights with the men I have with me, and do you bid Cleanor extend his line along the level beside the villages.\" When they had done so, there were enclosed--of captives for the slave market, one thousand; of cattle, two thousand; and of other small cattle, ten thousand. For the time being they took up quarters there.\n\n {etropkhaze}, a favourite word with our author. Herodotus uses it; so does Aristot.; so also Polybius; but the Atticists condemn it, except of course in poetry.\n\nIV\n\nBut the next day Seuthes burnt the villages to the ground; he left not 1 a single house, being minded to inspire terror in the rest of his enemies, and to show them what they also were to expect, if they refused obedience; and so he went back again. As to the booty, he sent off Heracliedes to Perinthus to dispose of it, with a view to future pay for the soldiers. But for himself he encamped with the Hellenes in the lowland country of the Thynians, the natives leaving the flats and betaking themselves in flight to the uplands.\n\nThere was deep snow, and cold so intense that the water brought in for dinner and the wine within the jars froze; and many of the Hellenes had their noses and ears frost-bitten. Now they came to understand why the Thracians wear fox-skin caps on their heads and about their ears; and why, on the same principle, they are frocked not only about the chest and bust but so as to cover the loins and thighs as well; and why on horseback they envelop themselves in long shawls which reach down to the feet, instead of the ordinary short rider's cloak. Seuthes sent off some of the prisoners to the hills with a message to say that if they did not come down to their homes, and live quietly and obey him, he would burn down their villages and their corn, and leave them 5 to perish with hunger. Thereupon down they came, women and children and the older men; the younger men preferred to quarter themselves in the villages on the skirts of the hills. On discovering this, Seuthes bade Xenophon take the youngest of the heavy infantry and join him on an expedition. They rose in the night, and by daybreak had reached the villages; but the majority of the inhabitants made good their escape, for the hills were close at hand. Those whom he did catch, Seuthes unsparingly shot down.\n\nNow there was a certain Olynthian, named Episthenes; he was a great lover of boys, and seeing a handsome lad, just in the bloom of youth, and carrying a light shield, about to be slain, he ran up to Xenophon and supplicated him to rescue the fair youth. Xenophon went to Seuthes and begged him not to put the boy to death. He explained to him the disposition of Episthenes; how he had once enrolled a company, the only qualification required being that of personal beauty; and with these handsome young men at his side there were none so brave as he. Seuthes put the question, \"Would you like to die on his behalf, Episthenes?\" whereat the other stretched out his neck, and said, \"Strike, if the boy bids you, and will thank his preserver.\" Seuthes, turning to the boy, asked, \"Shall I smite him instead of you?\" The boy shook his head, imploring him to slay neither the one nor the other, whereupon Episthenes caught the lad in his arms, exclaiming, \"It is time you did battle with me, Seuthes, for my boy; never will I yield him up,\" and Seuthes laughed: \"what must be must,\" and so consented.\n\nIn these villages he decided that they must bivouac, so that the men on the mountains might be still further deprived of subsistence. Stealthily descending he himself found quarters in the plain; while Xenophon with his picked troops encamped in the highest village on the skirts of the hills,; and the rest of the Hellenes hard by, among the highland Thracians, as they are called.\n\n Cf. \"Highlanders.\"\n\nAfter this, not many days had idly slipt away before the Thracians from the mountains came down and wished to arrange with Seuthes for 12 terms of truce and hostages. Simultaneously came Xenophon and informed Seuthes that they were camped in bad quarters, with the enemy next door; \"it would be pleasanter too,\" he added, \"to bivouac in a strong position in the open, than under cover on the edge of destruction.\" The other bade him take heart and pointed to some of their hostages, as much as to say \"Look there!\" Parties also from the mountaineers came down and pleaded with Xenophon himself, to help arrange a truce for them. This he agreed to do, bidding them to pluck up heart, and assuring them that they would meet with no mischief, if they yielded obedience to Seuthes. All their parleying, however, was, as it turned out, merely to get a closer inspection of things. This happened in the day, and in the following night the Thynians descended from the hill country and made an attack. In each case, the guide was the master of the house attacked; otherwise it would have taxed their powers to discover the houses in the dark, which, for the sake of their flocks and herds, were palisaded all round with great stockades. As soon as they had reached the doors of any particular house, the attack began, some hurling in their spears, others belabouring with their clubs, which they carried, it was said, for the purpose of knocking off the lance points from the shaft. Others were busy setting the place on fire; and they kept calling Xenophon by name: \"Come out, Xenophon, and die like a man, or we will roast you alive inside.\"\n\nBy this time too the flames were making their appearance through the roof, and Xenophon and his followers were within, with their coats of mail on, and big shields, swords, and helmets. Then Silanus, a Macistian, a youth of some eighteen years, signalled on the trumpet; and in an instant, out they all leapt with their drawn swords, and the inmates of other quarters as well. The Thracians took to their heels, according to their custom, swinging their light shields round their backs. As they leapt over the stockade some were captured, hanging on the top with their shields caught in the palings; others missed the way out, and so were slain; and the Hellenes chased them hotly, till they were outside the village.\n\n \"Of Macistus,\" a town in the Triphylia near Scillus.\n\nA party of Thynians turned back, and as the men ran past in bold 18 relief against a blazing house, they let fly a volley of javelins, out of the darkness into the glare, and wounded two captains, Hieronymus, an Euodean, and Theogenes, a Locrian. No one was killed, only the clothes and baggage of some of the men were consumed in the flames. Presently up came Seuthes to the rescue with seven troopers, the first to hand, and his Thracian trumpeteer by his side. Seeing that something had happened, he hastened to the rescue, and ever the while his bugler wound his horn, which music added terror to the foe. Arrived at length, he greeted them with outstretched hand, exclaiming, \"I thought to find you all dead men.\"\n\n If this is the same man as Hieronymus of Elis, who has been mentioned two or three times already, possibly the word {Euodea} points to some town or district of Elis; or perhaps the text is corrupt.\n\nAfter that, Xenophon begged him to hand over the hostages to himself, and if so disposed, to join him on an expedition to the hills, or if not, to let him go alone. Accordingly the next day Seuthes delivered up the hostages. They were men already advanced in years, but the pick of the mountaineers, as they themselves gave out. Not merely did Seuthes do this, but he came himself, with his force at his back (and by this time he had treble his former force, for many of the Odrysians, hearing of his proceedings, came down to join in the campaign); and the Thynians, espying from the mountains the vast array of heavy infantry and light infantry and cavalry, rank upon rank, came down and supplicated him to make terms. \"They were ready,\" they professed, \"to do all that he demanded; let him take pledges of their good faith.\" So Seuthes summoned Xenophon and explained their proposals, adding that he should make no terms with them, if Xenophon wished to punish them for their night attack. The latter replied: \"For my part, I should think their punishment is great enough already, if they are to be slaves instead of free men; still,\" he added, \"I advise you for the future to take as hostages those who are most capable of doing mischief, and to let the old men abide in peace at home.\" So to a man they gave in their adhesion in that quarter of the country.\n\nV\n\nCrossing over in the direction of the Thracians above Byzantium, they 1 reached the Delta, as it is called. Here they were no longer in the territory of the Maesades, but in the country of Teres the Odrysian ]. Here Heracleides met them with the proceeds of the spoil, and Seuthes picked out three pairs of mules (there were only three, the other teams being oxen); then he summoned Xenophon and bade him take them, and divide the rest between the generals and officers, to which Xenophon replied that for himself, he was content to receive his share another time, but added: \"Make a present of these to my friends here, the generals who have served with me, and to the officers.\" So of the pairs of mules Timasion the Dardanian received one, Cleanor the Orchomenian one, and Phryniscus the Achaean one. The teams of oxen were divided among the officers. Then Seuthes proceeded to remit pay due for the month already passed, but all he could give was the equivalent of twenty days. Heracleides insisted that this was all he had got by his trafficking. Whereupon Xenophon with some warmth exclaimed: \"Upon my word, Heracleides, I do not think you care for Seuthes' interest as you should. If you did, you have been at pains to bring back the full amount of the pay, even if you had had to raise a loan to do so, and, if by no other means, by selling the coat off your own back.\"\n\n See above re previous Teres. The words \"an ancient worthy\" may possibly be an editor's or commentator's note.\n\nWhat he said annoyed Heracleides, who was afraid of being ousted from the friendship of Seuthes, and from that day forward he did his best to calumniate Xenophon before Seuthes. The soldiers, on their side, laid the blame of course on Xenophon: \"Where was their pay?\" and Seuthes was vexed with him for persistently demanding it for them. Up to this date he had frequently referred to what he would do when he got to the seaboard again; how he intended to hand over to him Bisanthe, Ganos, and Neontichos. But from this time forward he never mentioned one of them again. The slanderous tongue of Heracleides had whispered him:--it was not safe to hand over fortified 8 towns to a man with a force at his back.\n\n For Bisanthe see above. Ganos, a little lower down the coast, with Neontichos once belonged to Alcibiades, if we may believe Cornelius Nepos, \"Alc.\" vii. 4, and Plutarch, \"Alc.\" c. 36. See above.\n\nConsequently Xenophon fell to considering what he ought to do as regards marching any further up the country; and Heracleides introduced the other generals to Seuthes, urging them to say that they were quite as well able to lead the army as Xenophon, and promising them that within a day or two they should have full pay for two months, and he again implored them to continue the campaign with Seuthes. To which Timasion replied that for his part he would continue no campaign without Xenophon; not even if they were to give him pay for five months; and what Timasion said, Phryniscus and Cleanor repeated; the views of all three coincided.\n\nSeuthes fell to upbraiding Heracleides in round terms. \"Why had he not invited Xenophon with the others?\" and presently they invited him, but by himself alone. He, perceiving the knavery of Heracleides, and that his object was to calumniate him with the other generals, presented himself; but at the same time he took care to bring all the generals and the officers. After their joint consent had been secured, they continued the campaign. Keeping the Pontus on their right, they passed through the millet-eating Thracians, as they are called, and reached Salmydessus. This is a point at which many trading vessels bound for the Black Sea run aground and are wrecked, owing to a sort of marshy ledge or sandbank which runs out for a considerable distance into the sea. The Thracians, who dwell in these parts, have set up pillars as boundary marks, and each set of them has the pillage of its own flotsom and jetsom; for in old days, before they set up these landmarks, the wreckers, it is said, used freely to fall foul of and slay one another. Here was a rich treasure trove, of beds and boxes 14 numberless, with a mass of written books, and all the various things which mariners carry in their wooden chests. Having reduced this district, they turned round and went back again. By this time the army of Seuthes had grown to be considerably larger than the Hellenic army; for on the one hand, the Odrysians flocked down in still larger numbers, and on the other, the tribes which gave in their adhesion from time to time were amalgamated with his armament. They got into quarters on the flat country above Selybria at about three miles distance from the sea. As to pay, not a penny was as yet forthcoming, and the soldiers were cruelly disaffected to Xenophon, whilst Seuthes, on his side, was no longer so friendlily disposed. If Xenophon ever wished to come face to face with him, want of leisure or some other difficulty always seemed to present itself.\n\n Or, \"the Melinophagi.\"\n\n See, for a description of this savage coast, Aesch. \"Prom.\" vinc. 726, etc.--\n\n\"{trakheia pontou Salmudesia gnathos ekhthroxenos nautaisi, metruia neon.}\"\n\n\"The rugged Salmudesian jaw of the Black Sea, Inhospitable to sailors, stepmother of ships.\"\n\nBut the poet is at fault in his geography, since he connects \"the Salmydesian jaw\" with the Thermodon.\n\n Lit. \"thirty stades.\" Selybria is about fourty-four miles from Byzantium, two-thirds of the way to Perinthus.\n\nVI\n\nAt this date, when nearly two months had already passed, an embassy 1 arrived. These were two agents from Thibron--Charminus, a Lacedaemonian, and Polynicus. They were sent to say that the Lacedaemonians had resolved to open a campaign against Tissaphernes, and that Thibron, who had set sail to conduct the war, was anxious to avail himself of the troops. He could guarantee that each soldier should receive a daric a month as pay, the officers double pay, and the generals quadruple. The Lacedaemonian emissaries had no sooner arrived than Heracleides, having learnt that they had come in search of the Hellenic troops, goes off himself to Seuthes and says: \"The best thing that could have happened; the Lacedaemonians want these troops and you have done with them, so that if you hand over the troops to them, you will do the Lacedaemonians a good turn and will cease to be bothered for pay any more. The country will be quit of them once and for ever.\"\n\nOn hearing this Seuthes bade him introduce the emissaries. As soon as they had stated that the object of their coming was to treat for the Hellenic troops, he replied that he would willingly give them up, that his one desire was to be the friend and ally of Lacedaemon. So he invited them to partake of hospitality, and entertained them 3 magnificently; but he did not invite Xenophon, nor indeed any of the other generals. Presently the Lacedaemonians asked: \"What sort of man is Xenophon?\" and Seuthes answered: \"Not a bad fellow in most respects; but he is too much the soldiers' friend; and that is why it goes ill with him.\" They asked: \"Does he play the popular leader?\" and Heracleides answered: \"Exactly so.\" \"Well then,\" said they, \"he will oppose our taking away the troops, will he not?\" \"To be sure he will,\" said Heracleides; \"but you have only to call a meeting of the whole body, and promise them pay, and little further heed will they pay to him; they will run off with you.\" \"How then are we to get them collected?\" they asked. \"Early to-morrow,\" said Heracleides, \"we will bring you to them; and I know,\" he added once more, \"as soon as they set eyes on you, they will flock to you with alacrity.\" Thus the day ended.\n\nThe next day Seuthes and Heracleides brought the two Laconian agents to the army, and the troops were collected, and the agents made a statement as follows: \"The Lacedaemonians have resolved on war with Tissaphernes, who did you so much wrong. By going with us therefore you will punish your enemy, and each of you will get a daric a month, the officers twice that sum, and the generals quadruple.\" The soldiers lent willing ears, and up jumped one of the Arcadians at once, to find fault with Xenophon. Seuthes also was hard by, wishing to know what was going to happen. He stood within ear shot, and his interpreter by his side; not but what he could understand most of what was said in Greek himself. At this point the Arcadian spoke: \"For the matter of that, Lacedaemonians, we should have been by your sides long ago, if Xenophon had not persuaded us and brought us hither. We have never ceased campaigning, night and day, the dismal winter through, but he reaps the fruit of our toils. Seuthes has enriched him privately, but deprives us of our honest earnings; so that, standing here as I do to address you first, all I can say is, that if I might see the fellow stoned to death as a penalty for all the long dance he has led us, I 10 should feel I had got my pay in full, and no longer grudge the pains we have undergone.\" The speaker was followed by another and then another in the same strain; and after that Xenophon made the following speech:--\n\n\"True is the old adage; there is nothing which mortal man may not expect to see. Here am I being accused by you to-day, just where my conscience tells me that I have displayed the greatest zeal on your behalf. Was I not actually on my road home when I turned back? Not, God knows, because I learned that you were in luck's way, but because I heard that you were in sore straits, and I wished to help you, if in any way I could. I returned, and Seuthes yonder sent me messenger after messenger, and made me promise upon promise, if only I could persuade you to come to him. Yet, as you yourselves will bear me witness, I was not to be diverted. Instead of setting my hand to do that, I simply led you to a point from which, with least loss of time, I thought you could cross into Asia. This I believed was the best thing for you, and you I knew desired it.\n\n\"But when Aristarchus came with his ships of war and hindered our passage across, you will hardly quarrel with me for the step I then took in calling you together that we might advisedly consider our best course. Having heard both sides--first Aristarchus, who ordered you to march to the Chersonese, then Seuthes, who pleaded with you to undertake a campaign with himself--you all proposed to go with Seuthes; and you all gave your votes to that effect. What wrong did I commit in bringing you, whither you were eager to go? If, indeed, since the time when Seuthes began to tell lies and cheat us about the pay, I have supported him in this, you may justly find fault with me and hate me. But if I, who at first was most of all his friend, to-day am more than any one else at variance with him, how can I, who have chosen you and rejected Seuthes, in fairness be blamed by you for the very thing which has been the ground of quarrel between him and me? But you will tell me, perhaps, that I get from Seuthes what is by right yours, and that I deal subtly by you? But is it not clear that, if Seuthes has paid me anything, he has at any rate not done so with 16 the intention of losing by what he gives me, whilst he is still your debtor? If he gave to me, he gave in order that, by a small gift to me, he might escape a larger payment to yourselves. But if that is what you really think has happened, you can render this whole scheme of ours null and void in an instant by exacting from him the money which is your due. It is clear, Seuthes will demand back from me whatever I have got from him, and he will have all the more right to do so, if I have failed to secure for him what he bargained for when I took his gifts. But indeed, I am far removed from enjoying what is yours, and I swear to you by all the gods and goddesses that I have not taken even what Seuthes promised me in private. He is present himself and listening, and he is aware in his own heart whether I swear falsely. And what will surprise you the more, I can swear besides, that I have not received even what the other generals have received, no, nor yet what some of the officers have received. But how so? why have I managed my affairs no better? I thought, sirs, the more I helped him to bear his poverty at the time, the more I should make him my friend in the day of his power. Whereas, it is just when I see the star of his good fortune rising, that I have come to divine the secret of his character.\n\n\"Some one may say, are you not ashamed to be so taken in like a fool? Yes, I should be ashamed, if it had been an open enemy who had so decieved me. But, to my mind, when friend cheats friend, a deeper stain attaches to the perpetrator than to the victim of deceit. Whatever precaution a man may take against his friend, that we took in full. We certainly gave him no pretext for refusing to pay us what he promised. We were perfectly upright in our dealings with him. We did not dawdle over his affairs, nor did we shrink from any work to which he challenged us.\n\n\"But you will say, I ought to have taken security of him at the time, so that had he fostered the wish, he might have lacked the ability to decieve. To meet that retort, I must beg you to listen to certain things, which I should never have said in his presence, except for your utter want of feeling towards me, or your extraordinary ingratitude. Try and recall the posture of your affairs, when I 24 extricated you and brought you to Seuthes. Do you not recollect how at Perinthus Aristarchus shut the gates in your faces each time you offered to approach the town, and how you were driven to camp outside under the canopy of heaven? It was midwinter; you were thrown upon the resources of a market wherein few were the articles offered for sale, and scanty the wherewithal to purchase them. Yet stay in Thrace you must, for there were ships of war riding at anchor in the bay, ready to hinder your passage across; and what did that stay imply? It meant being in a hostile country, confronted by countless cavalry, legions of light infantry. And what had we? A heavy infantry force certainly, with which we could have dashed at villages in a body possibly, and seized a modicum of food at most; but as to pursuing the enemy with such a force as ours, or capturing men or cattle, the thing was out of the question; for when I rejoined you your original cavalry and light infantry divisions had disappeared. In such sore straits you lay!\n\n\"Supposing that, without making any demands for pay whatever, I had merely won for you the alliance of Seuthes--whose cavalry and light infantry were just what you needed--would you not have thought that I had planned very well for you? I presume, it was through your partnership with him and his that you were able to find such complete stores of corn in the villages, when the Thracians were driven to take to their heels in such hot haste, and you had so large a share of captives and cattle. Why! from the day on which his cavalry force was attached to us, we never set eyes on a single foeman in the field, though up to that date the enemy with his cavalry and his light infantry used undauntedly to hang on our heels, and effectually prevented us from scattering in small bodies and reaping a rich harvest of provisions. But if he who partly gave you this security has failed to pay in full the wages due to you therefrom, is not that a terrible misfortune? So monstrous indeed that you think I ought not to go forth alive.\n\n I.e. the fate of a scape-goat is too good for me.\n\n\"But let me ask you, in what condition do you turn your backs on this 31 land to-day? Have you not wintered here in the lap of plenty? Whatever you have got from Seuthes has been surplus gain. Your enemies have had to meet the bill of your expenses, whilst you led a merry round of existence, in which you have not once set eyes on the dead body of a comrade or lost one living man. Again, if you have achieved any, (or rather many) noble deeds against the Asiatic barbarian, you have them safe. And in addition to these to-day you have won for yourselves a second glory. You undertook a campaign against the European Thracians, and have mastered them. What I say then is, that these very matters which you make a ground of quarrel against myself, are rather blessings for which you ought to show gratitude to heaven.\n\n\"Thus far I have confined myself to your side of the matter. Bear with me, I beg you, while we examine mine. When I first essayed to part with you and journey homewards, I was doubly blest. From your lips I had won some praise, and, thanks to you, I had obtained glory from the rest of Hellas. I was trusted by the Lacedaemonians; else would they not have sent me back to you. Whereas to-day I turn to go, calumniated before the Lacedaemonians by yourselves, detested in your behalf by Seuthes, whom I meant so to benefit, by help of you, that I should find in him a refuge for myself and for my children, if children I might have, in after time. And you the while, for whose sake I have incurred so much hate, the hate of people far superior to me in strength, you, for whom I have not yet ceased to devise all the good I can, entertain such sentiments about me. Why? I am no renegade or runaway slave, you have got hold of. If you carry out what you say, be sure you will have done to death a man who has passed many a vigil in watching over you; who has shared with you many a toil and run many a risk in turn and out of turn; who, thanks to the gracious gods! has by your side set up full many a trophy over the barbarian; who, lastly, has strained every nerve in his body to protect you against yourselves. And so it is, that to-day you can move freely, where you choose, by sea or by land, and no one can say you nay; and you, on 37 whom this large liberty dawns, who are sailing to a long desired goal, who are sought after by the greatest of military powers, who have pay in prospect, and for leaders these Lacedaemonians, our acknowledged chiefs: now is the appointed time, you think, to put me to a speedy death. But in the days of our difficulties it was very different, O ye men of marvellous memory! No! in those days you called me 'father!' and you promised you would bear me ever in mind, 'your benefactor.' Not so, however, not so ungracious are those who have come to you to-day; nor, if I mistake not, have you bettered yourselves in their eyes by your treatment of me.\"\n\nWith these words he paused, and Charminus the Lacedaemonian got up and said: \"Nay, by the Twins, you are wrong, surely, in your anger against this man; I myself can bear testimony in his favour. When Polynicus and I asked Seuthes, what sort of a man he was? Seuthes answered:--he had but one fault to find with him, that he was too much the soldiers' friend, which also was the cause why things went wrong with him, whether as regards us Lacedaemonians or himself, Seuthes.\"\n\nUpon that Eurylochus of Lusia, an Arcadian, got up and said (addressing the two Lacedaemonians), \"Yes, sirs; and what strikes me is that you cannot begin your generalship of us better than by exacting from Seuthes our pay. Whether he like it or no, let him pay in full; and do not take us away before.\"\n\nPolycrates the Athenian, who was put forward by Xenophon, said: \"If my eyes do not deceive me, sirs, there stands Heracleides, yonder, the man who received the property won by our toil, who took and sold it, and never gave back either to Seuthes or to us the proceeds of the sale, but kept the money to himself, like the thief he is. If we are wise, we will lay hold of him, for he is no Thracian, but a Hellene; and against Hellenes is the wrong he has committed.\"\n\nWhen Heracleides heard these words, he was in great consternation; so he came to Seuthes and said: \"If we are wise we will get away from here out of reach of these fellows.\" So they mounted their horses and were gone in a trice, galloping to their own camp. Subsequently 42 Seuthes sent Abrozelmes, his private interpreter, to Xenophon, begging him to stay behind with one thousand heavy tropps; and engaging duly to deliver to him the places on the seaboard, and the other things which he had promised; and then, as a great secret, he told him, that he had heard from Polynicus that if he once got into the clutches of the Lacedaemonians, Thibron was certain to put him to death. Similar messages kept coming to Xenophon by letter or otherwise from several quarters, warning him that he was calumniated, and had best be on his guard. Hearing which, he took two victims and sacrificed to Zeus the King: \"Whether it were better and happier to stay with Seuthes on the terms proposed, or depart with the army?\" The answer he received was, \"Depart.\"\n\nVII\n\nAfter this, Seuthes removed his camp to some considerable distance; 1 and the Hellenes took up their quarters in some villages, selecting those in which they could best supply their commissariat, on the road to the sea. Now these particular villages had been given by Seuthes to Medosades. Accordingly, when the latter saw his property in the villages being expended by the Hellenes, he was not over well pleased; and taking with him an Odrysian, a powerful person amongst those who had come down from the interior, and about thirty mounted troopers, he came and challenged Xenophon to come forth from the Hellenic host. He, taking some of the officers and others of a character to be relied upon, came forward. Then Medosades, addressing Xenophon, said: \"You are doing wrong to pillage our villages; we give you fair warning--I, in behalf of Seuthes, and this man by my side, who comes from Medocus, the king up country--to begone out of the land. If you refuse, understand, we have no notion of handing it over to you; but if you injure our country we will retaliate upon you as foes.\"\n\nXenophon, hearing what they had to say, replied: \"Such language addressed to us by you, of all people, is hard to answer. Yet for the sake of the young man with you, I will attempt to do so, that at least he may learn how different your nature is from ours. We,\" he continued, \"before we were your friends, had the free run of this country, moving this way or that, as it took our fancy, pillaging and 5 burning just as we chose; and you yourself, Medosades, whenever you came to us on an embassy, camped with us, without apprehension of any foe. As a tribe collectively you scarcely approached the country at all, or if you found yourselves in it, you bivouacked with your horses bitted and bridled, as being in the territory of your superiors. Presently you made friends with us, and, thanks to us, by God's help you have won this country, out of which to-day you seek to drive us; a country which we held by our own strength and gave to you. No hostile force, as you well know, was capable of expelling us. It might have been expected of you personally to speed us on our way with some gift, in return for the good we did you. Not so; even though our backs are turned to go, we are too slow in our movements for you. You will not suffer us to take up quarters even, if you can help it, and these words arouse no shame in you, either before the gods, or this Odrysian, in whose eyes to-day you are man of means, though until you cultivated our friendship you lived a robber's life, as you have told us. However, why do you address yourself to me? I am no longer in command. Our generals are the Lacedaemonians, to whom you and yours delivered the army for withdrawal; and that, without even inviting me to attend, you most marvellous of men, so that if I lost their favour when I brought you the troops, I might now win their gratitude by restoring them.\"\n\nAs soon as the Odrysian had heard this statement, he exclaimed: \"For my part, Medosades, I sink under the earth for very shame at what I hear. If I had known the truth before, I would never have accompanied you. As it is, I return at once. Never would King Medocus applaud me, if I drove forth his benefactors.\" With these words, he mounted his horse and rode away, and with him the rest of his horsemen, except four or five. But Medosades, still vexed by the pillaging of the country, urged Xenophon to summon the two Lacedaemonians; and he, taking the pick of his men, came to Charminus and Polynicus and informed them that they were summoned by Medosades; probably they, like himself, would be warned to leave the country; \"if so,\" he added, 14 \"you will be able to recover the pay which is owing to the army. You can say to them, that the army has requested you to assist in exacting their pay from Seuthes, whether he like it or not; that they have promised, as soon as they get this, cheerfully to follow you; that the demand seems to you to be only just, and that you have accordingly promised not to leave, until the soldiers have got their dues.\" The Lacedaemonians accepted the suggestion: they would apply these arguments and others the most forcible they could hit upon; and with the proper representatives of the army, they immediately set off.\n\nOn their arrival Charminus spoke: \"If you have anything to say to us, Medosades, say it; but if not, we have something to say to you.\" And Medosades submissively made answer: \"I say,\" said he, \"and Seuthes says the same: we think we have a right to ask that those who have become our friends should not be ill-treated by you; whatever ill you do to them you really do to us, for they are a part of us.\" \"Good!\" replied the Lacedaemonians, \"and we intend to go away as soon as those who won for you the people and the territory in question have got their pay. Failing that, we are coming without further delay to assist them and to punish certain others who have broken their oaths and done them wrong. If it should turn out that you come under this head, when we come to exact justice, we shall begin with you.\" Xenophon added: \"Would you prefer, Medosades, to leave it to these people themselves, in whose country we are (your friends, since this is the designation you prefer), to decide by ballot, which of the two should leave the country, you or we?\" To that proposal he shook his head, but he trusted the two Laconians might be induced to go to Seuthes about the pay, adding, \"Seuthes, I am sure, will lend a willing ear;\" or if they could not go, then he prayed them to send Xenophon with himself, promising to lend the latter all the aid in his power, and finally he begged them not to burn the villages. Accordingly they sent Xenophon, and with him a serviceable staff. Being arrived, he addressed Seuthes thus:--\n\n\"Seuthes, I am here to advance no claims, but to show you, if I can, 21 how unjust it was on your part to be angered with me because I zealously demanded of you on behalf of the soldiers what you promised them. According to my belief, it was no less to your interest to deliver it up, than it was to theirs to receive it. I cannot forget that, next to the gods, it was they who raised you up to a conspicuous eminence, when they made you king of large territory and many men, a position in which you cannot escape notice, whether you do good or do evil. For a man so circumstanced, I regarded it as a great thing that he should avoid the suspicion even of ungrateful parting with his benefactors. It was a great thing, I thought, that you should be well spoken of by six thousand human beings; but the greatest thing of all, that you should in no wise discredit the sincerity of your own word. For what of the man who cannot be trusted? I see that the words of his mouth are but vain words, powerless, and unhonoured; but with him who is seen to regard truth, the case is otherwise. He can achieve by his words what another achieves by force. If he seeks to bring the foolish to their senses--his very frown, I perceive, has a more sobering effect than the chastisement inflicted by another. Or in negotiations the very promises of such an one are of equal weight with the gifts of another.\n\n\"Try and recall to mind in your own case, what advance of money you made to us to purchase our alliance. You know you did not advance one penny. It was simply confidence in the sincerity of your word which incited all these men to assist you in your campaign, and so to acquire for you an empire, worth many times more than thirty talents, which is all they now claim to receive. Here then, first of all, goes the credit which won for you your kingdom, sold for so mean a sum. Let me remind you of the great importance which you then attached to the acquisition of your present conquests. I am certain that to achieve what stands achieved to-day, you would willingly have foregone the gain of fifty times that paltry sum. To me it seems that to lose your present fortune were a more serious loss than never to have won it; since surely it is harder to be poor after being rich than never to 28 have tasted wealth at all, and more painful to sink to the level of a subject, being a king, then never to have worn a crown.\n\n\"You cannot forget that your present vassals were not persuaded to become your subjects out of love for you, but by sheer force; and but for some restraining dread they would endeavour to be free again to-morrow. And how do you propose to stimulate their sense of awe, and keep them in good behaviour towards you? Shall they see our soldiers so disposed towards you that a word on your part would suffice to keep them now, or if necessary would bring them back again to-morrow? while others hearing from us a hundred stories in your praise, hasten to present themselves at your desire? Or will you drive them to conclude adversely, that through mistrust of what has happened now, no second set of soldiers will come to help you, for even these troops of ours are more their friends than yours? And indeed it was not because they fell short of us in numbers that they became your subjects, but from lack of proper leaders. There is a danger, therefore, now lest they should choose as their protectors some of us who regard ourselves as wronged by you, or even better men than us--the Lacedaemonians themselves; supposing our soldiers undertake to serve with more enthusiasm, if the debt you owe to them be first exacted; and the Lacedaemonians, who need their services, consent to this request. It is plain, at any rate, that the Thracians, now prostrate at your feet, would display far more enthusiasm in attacking, than in assisting you; for your mastery means their slavery, and your defeat their liberty.\n\n\"Again, the country is now yours, and from this time forward you have to make provision for what is yours; and how will you best secure it an immunity from ill? Either these soldiers receive their dues and go, leaving a legacy of peace behind, or they stay and occupy an enemy's country, whilst you endeavour, by aid of a still larger army, to open a new campaign and turn them out; and your new troops will also need provisions. Or again, which will be the greater drain on your purse? to pay off your present debt, or, with that still owing, to bid for more troops, and of a better quality?\n\n\"Heracleides, as he used to prove to me, finds the sum excessive. But 35 surely it is a far less serious thing for you to take and pay it back to-day than it would have been to pay the tithe of it, before we came to you; since the limit between less and more is no fixed number, but depends on the relative capacity of payer and recipient, and your yearly income now is larger than the whole property which you possessed in earlier days.\n\n\"Well, Seuthes, for myself these remarks are the expression of friendly forethought for a friend. They are expressed in the double hope that you may show yourself worthy of the good things which the gods have given you, and that my reputation may not be ruined with the army. For I must assure you that to-day, if I wished to injure a foe, I could not do so with this army. Nor again, if I wished to come and help you, should I be competent to the task; such is the disposition of the troops towards me. And yet I call you to witness, along with the gods who know, that never have I received anything from you on account of the soldiers. Never to this day have I, to my private gain, asked for what was theirs, nor even claimed the promises which were made to myself; and I swear to you, not even had you proposed to pay me my dues, would I have accepted them, unless the soldiers also had been going to receive theirs too; how could I? How shameful it would have been in me, so to have secured my own interests, whilst I disregarded the disastrous state of theirs, I being so honoured by them. Of course to the mind of Heracleides this is all silly talk; since the one great object is to keep money by whatever means. That is not my tenet, Seuthes. I believe that no fairer or brighter jewel can be given to a man, and most of all a prince, than the threefold grace of valour, justice, and generosity. He that possesses these is rich in the multitude of friends which surround him; rich also in the desire of others to be included in their number. While he prospers, he is surrounded by those who will rejoice with him in his joy; or if misfortune overtake him, he has no lack of sympathisers to give him help. However, if you have failed to learn from my deeds that I was, heart and soul, your friend; if my words are powerless to reveal the fact to-day, I would at least direct your attention to what the 43 soldiers said; you were standing by and heard what those who sought to blame me said. They accused me to the Lacedaemonians, and the point of their indictment was that I set greater store by yourself than by the Lacedaemonians; but, as regards themselves, the charge was that I took more pains to secure the success of your interests than their own. They suggested that I had actually taken gifts from you. Was it, do you suppose, because they detected some ill-will in me towards you that they made the allegation? Was it not rather, that they had noticed my abundant zeal on your behalf?\n\n\"All men believe, I think, that a fund of kindly feeling is due to him from whom we accept gifts. But what is your behaviour? Before I had ministered to you in any way, or done you a single service, you welcomed me kindly with your eyes, your voice, your hospitality, and you could not sate yourself with promises of all the fine things that were to follow. But having once achieved your object, and become the great man you now are, as great indeed as I could make you, you can stand by and see me degraded among my own soldiers! Well, time will teach you--that I fully believe--to pay whatever seems to you right, and even without the lessons of that teacher you will hardly care to see whose who have spent themselves in benefiting you, become your accusers. Only, when you do pay your debt, I beg of you to use your best endeavour to right me with the soldiers. Leave me at least where you found me; that is all I ask.\"\n\nAfter listening to this appeal, Seuthes called down curses on him, whose fault it was, that the debt had not long ago been paid, and, if the general suspicion was correct, this was Heracleides. \"For myself,\" said Seuthes, \"I never had any idea of robbing you of your just dues. I will repay.\" Then Xenophon rejoined: \"Since you are minded to pay, I only ask that you will do so through me, and will not suffer me on your account to hold a different position in the army from what I held when we joined you.\" He replied: \"As far as that goes, so far from holding a less honoured position among your own men on my account, if you will stay with me, keeping only a thousand heavy infantry, I will deliver to you the fortified places and everything I promised.\" The other answered: \"On these terms I may not accept them, only let us go 51 free.\" \"Nay, but I know,\" said Seuthes, \"that it is safer for you to bide with me than to go away.\" Then Xenophon again: \"For your forethought I thank you, but I may not stay. Somewhere I may rise to honour, and that, be sure, shall redound to your gain also.\" Thereupon Seuthes spoke: \"Of silver I have but little; that little, however, I give to you, one talent; but of beeves I can give you six hundred head, and of sheep four thousand, and of slaves six score. These take, and the hostages besides, who wronged you, and begone.\" Xenophon laughed and said: \"But supposing these all together do not amount to the pay; for whom is the talent, shall I say? It is a little dangerous for myself, is it not? I think I had better be on the look-out for stones when I return. You heard the threats?\"\n\nSo for the moment he stayed there, but the next day Seuthes gave up to them what he had promised, and sent an escort to drive the cattle. The soldiers at first maintained that Xenophon had gone to take up his abode with Seuthes, and to receive what he had been promised; so when they saw him they were pleased, and ran to meet him. And Xenophon, seeing Charminus and Polynicus, said: \"Thanks to your intervention, this much has been saved for the army. My duty is to deliver this fraction over to your keeping; do you divide and distribute it to the soldiers.\" Accordingly they took the property and appointed official vendors of the booty, and in the end incurred considerable blame. Xenophon held aloof. In fact it was no secret that he was making his preparations to return home, for as yet the vote of banishment had not been passed at Athens. But the authorities in the camp came to him and begged him not to go away until he had conducted the army to its destination, and handed it over to Thibron.\n\n I.e. \"at this moment the vote of banishment had not been passed which would prevent his return to Athens.\" The natural inference from these words is, I think, that the vote of banishment was presently passed, at any rate considerably earlier than the battle of Coronea in B.C. 394, five years and a half afterwards.\n\nVIII\n\nFrom this place they sailed across to Lampsacus, and here Xenophon was 1 met by Eucleides the soothsayer, a Phliasian, the son of Cleagoras, who painted \"the dreams\" in the Lycium. Eucleides congratulated Xenophon upon his safe return, and asked him how much gold he had got? and Xenophon had to confess: \"Upon my word, I shall have barely enough to get home, unless I sell my horse, and what I have about my person.\" The other could not credit the statement. Now when the Lampsacenes sent gifts of hospitaliry to Xenophon, and he was sacrificing to Apollo, he requested the presence of Eucleides; and the latter, seeing the victims, said: \"Now I believe what you said about having no money. But I am certain,\" he continued, \"if it were ever to come, there is an obstacle in the way. If nothing else, you are that obstacle yourself.\" Xenophon admitted the force of that remark. Then the other: \"Zeus Meilichios is an obstacle to you, I am sure,\" adding in another tone of voice, \"have you tried sacrificing to that god, as I was wont to sacrifice and offer whole burnt offerings for you at home?\" Xenophon replied that since he had been abroad, he had not sacrificed to that god. Accordingly Eucleides counselled him to sacrifice in the old customary way: he was sure that his fortune would improve. The nexy day Xenophon went on to Ophrynium and sacrificed, offering a holocaust of swine, after the custom of his family, and the signs which he obtained were favourable. That very day Bion and Nausicleides arrived laden with gifts for the army. These two were hospitably entertained by Xenophon, and were kind enough to repurchase the horse he had sold in Lampsacus for fifty darics; suspecting that he had parted with it out of need, and hearing that he was fond of the beast they restored it to him, refusing to be remunerated.\n\n Reading {ta enupnia}, or if {ta entoikhia} with Hug and others, translate \"the wall-paintings\" or the \"frescoes.\" Others think that a writing, not a painting, is referred to.\n\n Zeus Meilichios, or the gentle one. See Thuc. i. 126. The festival of the Diasia at Athens was in honour of that god, or rather of Zeus under that aspect. Cf. Arist. \"Clouds,\" 408.\n\nFrom that place they marched through the Troad, and, crossing Mount Ida, arrived at Antandrus, and then pushed along the seaboard of Mysia to the plain of Thebe. Thence they made their way through 8 Adramytium and Certonus by Atarneus, coming into the plain of the Caicus, and so reached Pergamus in Mysia.\n\n Thebe, a famous ancient town in Mysia, at the southern foot of Mt. Placius, which is often mentioned in Homer (\"Il.\" i. 366, vi. 397, xxii. 479, ii. 691). See \"Dict. Geog.\" s.v. The name {Thebes pedion} preserves the site. Cf. above {Kaustrou pedion}, and such modern names as \"the Campagna\" or \"Piano di Sorrento.\"\n\n The site of Certonus is not ascertained. Some critics have conjectured that the name should be Cytonium, a place between Mysia and Lydia; and Hug, who reads {Kutoniou}, omits {odeusantes par 'Atanea}, \"they made their way by Atarneus,\" as a gloss.\n\nHere Xenophon was hospitably entertained at the house of Hellas, the wife of Gongylus the Eretrian, the mother of Gorgion and Gongylus. From her he learnt that Asidates, a Persian notable, was in the plain. \"If you take thirty men and go by night, you will take him prisoner,\" she said, \"wife, children, money, and all; of money he has a store;\" and to show them the way to these treasures, she sent her own cousin and Daphnagoras, whom she set great store by. So then Xenophon, with these two to assist, did sacrifice; and Basias, an Eleian, the soothsayer in attendance, said that the victims were as promising as could be, and the great man would be an easy prey. Accordingly, after dinner he set off, taking with him the officers who had been hs staunchest friends and confidants throughout; as he wished to do them a good turn. A number of others came thrusting themselves on their company, to the number of six hundred, but the officers repelled them: \"They had no notion of sharing their portion of the spoil,\" they said, \"just as though the property lay already at their feet.\"\n\n Cf. Thuc. i. 128; also \"Hell.\" III. i. 6.\n\nAhout midnight they arrived. The slaves occupying the precincts of the tower, with the mass of goods and chattles, slipped through their fingers, their sole anxiety being to capture Asidates and his belongings. So they brought their batteries to bear, but failing to take the tower by assault (since it was high and solid, and well supplied with ramparts, besides having a large body of warlike defenders), they endeavoured to undermine it. The wall was eight clay bricks thick, but by daybreak the passage was effected and the wall undermined. At the first cleam of light through the aperture, one of 14 the defendants inside, with a large ox-spit, smote right through the thigh of the man nearest the hole, and the rest discharged their arrows so hotly that it was dangerous to come anywhere near the passage; and what with their shouting and kindling of beacon fires, a relief party at length arrived, consisting of Itabelius at the head of his force, and a body of Assyrian heavy infantry from Comania, and some Hyrcanian cavalry, the latter also being mercenaries of the king. There were eighty of them, and another detachment of light troops, about eight hundred, and more from Parthenium, and more again from Apollonia and the neighbouring places, also cavalry.\n\n The Hyrcanian cavalry play an important part in the \"Cyropaedeia.\" They are the Scirites of the Assyrian army who came over to Cyrus after the first battle. Their country is the fertile land touching the south-eastern corner of the Caspian. Cf. \"Cyrop.\" IV. ii. 8, where the author (or an editor) appends a note on the present status of the Hyrcanians.\n\nIt was now high time to consider how they were to beat a retreat. So seizing all the cattle and sheep to be had, with the slaves, they put them within a hollow square and proceed to drive them off. Not that they had a thought to give to the spoils now, but for precaution's sake and for fear lest if they left the goods and chattels behind and made off, the retreat would rapidly degenerate into a stampede, the enemy growing bolder as the troops lost heart. For the present then they retired as if they meant to do battle for the spoils. As soon as Gongylus espied how few the Hellenes were and how large the attacking party, out he came himself, in spite of his mother, with his private force, wishing to share in the action. Another too joined in the rescue--Procles, from Halisarna and Teuthrania, a descendant of Damaratus. By this time Xenophon and his men were being sore pressed by the arrows and slingstones, though they marched in a curve so as to keep their shields facing the missles, and even so, barely crossed the river Carcasus, nearly half of them wounded. Here it was that Agasias the Stymphalian, the captain, received his wound, while keeping up a steady unflagging fight against the enemy from beginning to end. And so they reached home in safety with about two hundred captives, and sheep enough for sacrifices.\n\nThe next day Xenophon sacrificed and led out the whole army under the 20 cover of night, intending to pierce far into the heart of Lydia with a view to lulling to sleep the enemy's alarm at his proxmity, and so in fact to put him off his guard. But Asidates, hearing that Xenophon had again sacrificed with the intention of another attack, and was approaching with his whole army, left his tower and took up quarters in some villages lying under the town of Parthenium. Here Xenophon's party fell in with him, and took him prisoner, with his wife, his children, his horses, and all that he had; and so the promise of the earlier victims was literally fulfilled.

DE CHARLUS \u2014 HIS CHARACTER PUZZLES ME MORE AND MORE \u2014 THE RED SHOES OF THE DUCHESS\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Albeit it was simply a Sunday in autumn, I had been born again, life lay intact before me, for that morning, after a succession of mild days, there had been a cold mist which had not cleared until nearly midday. A change in the weather is sufficient to create the world and oneself anew. Formerly, when the wind howled in my chimney, I would listen to the blows which it struck on the iron trap with as keen an emotion as if, like the famous bow-taps with which the C Minor Symphony opens, they had been the irresistible appeal of a mysterious destiny. Every change in the aspect of nature offers us a similar transformation by adapting our desires so as to harmonise with the new form of things. The mist, from the moment of my awakening, had made of me, instead of the centrifugal being which one is on fine days, a self-centred man, longing for the chimney corner and the nuptial couch, a shivering Adam in quest of a sedentary Eve, in this different world\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Between the soft grey tint of a morning landscape and the taste of a cup of chocolate I tried to account for all the originality of the physical, intellectual and moral life which I had taken with me, about a year earlier, to Donci\u00e8res, and which, blazoned with the oblong form of a bare hillside \u2014 always present even when it was invisible \u2014 formed in me a series of pleasures entirely distinct from all others, incommunicable to my friends, in the sense that the impressions, richly interwoven with one another, which gave them their orchestral accompaniment were a great deal more characteristic of them, to my subconscious mind, than any facts that I might have related. From this point of view the new world in which the mist of this morning had immersed me was a world already known to me (which only made it more real) and forgotten for some time (which restored all its novelty). And I was able to look at several of the pictures of misty landscapes which my memory had acquired, notably a series of \u2018Mornings at Donci\u00e8res,\u2019 including my first morning there in barracks and another, in a neighbouring country house, where I had gone with Saint-Loup to spend the night: in which from the windows, whose curtains I had drawn back at daybreak, before getting into bed again, in the first a trooper, in the second (on the thin margin of a pond and a wood all the rest of which was engulfed in the uniform and liquid softness of the mist) a coachman busy polishing a strap had appeared to me like those rare figures, scarcely visible to the eye obliged to adapt itself to the mysterious vagueness of their half-lights, which emerge from an obliterated fresco\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was from my bed that I was looking this afternoon at these pictorial memories, for I had gone back to bed to wait until the hour came at which, taking advantage of the absence of my parents, who had gone for a few days to Combray, I proposed to get up and go to a little play which was being given that evening in Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s drawing-room. Had they been at home I should perhaps not have ventured to go out; my mother in the delicacy of her respect for my grandmother\u2019s memory, wished the tokens of regret that were paid to it to be freely and sincerely given; she would not have forbidden me this outing, she would have disapproved of it. From Combray, on the other hand, had I consulted her wishes, she would not have replied in a melancholy: \u201cDo just as you like; you are old enough now to know what is right or wrong,\u201d but, reproaching herself for having left me alone in Paris, and measuring my grief by her own, would have wished for it distractions of a sort which she would have refused to herself, and which she persuaded herself that my grandmother, solicitous above all things for my health and the preservation of my nervous balance, would have advised me to take\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That morning the furnace of the new steam heater had for the first time been lighted. Its disagreeable sound \u2014 an intermittent hiccough \u2014 had no part whatsoever in my memories of Donci\u00e8res. But its prolonged encounter, in me this afternoon, with them was to give it so lasting an affinity with them that whenever, after succeeding more or less in forgetting it, I heard the central heater hiccough again it reminded me of them\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There was no one else in the house but Fran\u00e7oise. The grey light, falling like a fine rain on the earth, wove without ceasing a transparent web through which the Sunday holiday-makers appeared in a silvery sheen. I had flung to the foot of my bed the Figaro, for which I had been sending out religiously every morning, ever since I had sent in an article which it had not yet printed; despite the absence of the sun, the intensity of the daylight was an indication that we were still only half-way through the afternoon. The tulle window-curtains, vaporous and friable as they would not have been on a fine day, had that same blend of beauty and fragility that dragon flies\u2019 wings have, and Venetian glass. It depressed me all the more that I should be spending this Sunday by myself because I had sent a note that morning to Mlle, de Stermaria. Robert de Saint-Loup, whom his mother had at length succeeded in parting \u2014 after painful and abortive attempts \u2014 from his mistress, and who immediately afterwards had been sent to Morocco in the hope of his there forgetting one whom he had already for some little time ceased to love, had sent me a line, which had reached me the day before, announcing his arrival, presently, in France for a short spell of leave. As he would only be passing through Paris (where his family were doubtless afraid of seeing him renew relations with Rachel), he informed me, to shew me that he had been thinking of me, that he had met at Tangier Mile, or rather Mme. (for she had divorced her husband three months after their marriage) de Stermaria. And Robert, remembering what I had told him at Balbec, had asked her, on my behalf, to arrange a meeting. She would be delighted to dine with me, she had told him, on one of the evenings which, before her return to Brittany, she would be spending in Paris. He warned me to lose no time in writing to Mme. de Stermaria, for she would certainly have arrived before I got his letter. This had corne as no surprise to me, even although I had had no news of him since, at the time of my grandmother\u2019s last illness, he had accused me of perfidy and treachery. It had then been quite easy to see what must have happened. Rachel, who liked to provoke his jealousy \u2014 she had other reasons also for wishing me harm \u2014 had persuaded her lover that I had made a dastardly attempt to have relations with her in his absence. It is probable that he continued to believe in the truth of this allegation, but he had ceased to be in love with her, which meant that its truth or falsehood had become a matter of complete indifference to him, and our friendship alone remained. When, on meeting him again, I attempted to speak to him about his attack on me his sole answer was a cordial and friendly smile, which gave him the air of begging my pardon; then he turned the conversation to something else. All this was not to say that he did not, a little later, see Rachel occasionally when he was in Paris. The fellow-creatures who have played a leading part in one\u2019s life very rarely disappear from it suddenly with any finality. They return to take their old place in it at odd moments (so much so as to lead people to believe in a renewal of old love) before leaving it for ever. Saint-Loup\u2019s breach with Rachel had very soon become less painful to him, thanks to the soothing pleasure that was given him by her incessant demands for money. Jealousy, which prolongs the course of love, is not capable of containing many more ingredients than are the other forms of imagination. If one takes with one, when one starts on a journey, three or four images which incidentally one is sure to lose on the way (such as the lilies and anemones heaped on the Ponte Vecchio, or the Persian church shrouded in mist), one\u2019s trunk is already pretty full. When one parts from a mistress one would be just as glad, until one has begun to forget her, that she should not become the property of three or four potential protectors whom one has in one\u2019s mind\u2019s eye, of whom, that is to say, one is jealous: all those whom one does not so picture count for nothing. Now frequent demands for money from a cast-off mistress no more give one a complete idea of her life than charts shewing a high temperature would of her illness. But the latter would at any rate be an indication that she was ill, and the former furnish a presumption, vague enough, it is true, that the forsaken one, or forsaker (whichever she be) cannot have found anything very remarkable in the way of rich protectors. And so each demand is welcomed with the joy which a lull produces in the jealous one\u2019s sufferings, while he responds to it at once by dispatching money, for naturally he does not like to think of her being in want of anything, except lovers (one of the three lovers he has in his mind\u2019s eye), until time has enabled him to regain his composure and he can learn without the slightest emotion the name of his successor. Sometimes Rachel came in so late at night that she could ask her former lover\u2019s permission to lie down beside him until the morning. This was a great comfort to Robert, for it refreshed his memory of how they had, after all, lived in intimacy together merely to see that even if he took the greater part of the bed for himself it did not in the least interfere with her sleep. He realised that she was more comfortable, lying close to his body, than she would have been elsewhere, that she felt herself, by his side \u2014 even in an hotel \u2014 to be in a bedroom known of old, in which the force of habit prevails and one sleeps better. He felt that his shoulders, his limbs, all of him were for her, even when he was unduly restless, from sleeplessness or from having to get up in the night things so entirely usual that they could not disturb her, and that the perception of them added still further to her sense of repose\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To revert to where we were, I had been all the more disquieted by Robert\u2019s letter in that I could read between the lines what he had not ventured to write more explicitly. \u201cYou can most certainly ask her to dine in a private room,\u201d he told me. \u201cShe is a charming young person, a delightful nature you will get on splendidly with her, and I am sure you will have a capital evening together.\u201d As my parents were returning at the end of the week on Saturday or Sunday, and as after that I should be forced to dine every evening at home, I had written at once to Mme. de Stermaria, proposing any evening that might suit her, up to Friday. A message was brought back that I should hear from her in writing the same evening, about eight o\u2019clock. The time would have passed quickly enough if I had had, during the afternoon that separated me from her letter, the help of a visit from anyone else. When the hours pass wrapped in conversation one ceases to count, or indeed to notice them, they vanish, and suddenly it is a long way beyond the point at which it escaped you that there reappears the nimble truant time. But if we are alone, our preoccupation, by bringing before us the still distant and incessantly awaited moment with the frequency and uniformity of a ticking pendulum, divides, or rather multiplies the hours by all the minutes which, had we been with friends, we should not have counted. And confronted, by the incessant return of my desire, with the ardent pleasure which I was going to taste \u2014 not for some days though, alas! \u2014 in Mme. de Stermaria\u2019s company, this afternoon, which I should have to spend by myself, seemed to me very empty and very melancholy\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Every now and then I heard the sound of the lift coming up, but it was followed by a second sound, not that for which I was hoping, namely the sound of its coming to a halt at our landing, but another very different sound which the lift made in continuing its progress to the floors above and which, because it so often meant the desertion of my floor when I was expecting a visitor, remained for me at other times, even when I had no wish to see anyone, a sound lugubrious in itself, in which there echoed, as it were, a sentence of solitary confinement. Weary, resigned, busy for several hours still over its immemorial task, the grey day stitched its shimmering needlework of light and shade, and it saddened me to think that I was to be left alone with a thing that knew me no more than would a seamstress who, installed by the window so as to see better while she finished her work, paid no attention to the person present with her in the room. Suddenly, although I had heard no bell, Fran\u00e7oise opened the door to let in Albertine, who came forward smiling, silent, plump, containing in the fulness of her body, made ready so that I might continue living them, come in search of me, the days we had spent together at that Balbec to which I had never since returned. No doubt, whenever we see again a person with whom our relations \u2014 however trivial they may have been \u2014 are altered, it is like a juxtaposition of two different periods. For this, we do not require that a former mistress should come to call upon us as a friend, all that we need is the visit to Paris of a person whom we had known in the daily round of some particular kind of life, and that this life should have ceased for us, were it no more than a week ago. On each of Albertine\u2019s smiling, questioning, blushing features I could read the questions: \u201cAnd Madame de Villeparisis? And the dancing-master? And the pastry-cook?\u201d When she sat down her back seemed to be saying: \u201cGracious! There\u2019s no cliff here; you don\u2019t mind if I sit down beside you, all the same, as I used to do at Balbec?\u201d She was like an enchantress handing me a mirror that reflected time. In this she was like all the people whom we seldom see now but with whom at one time we lived on more intimate terms. With Al-bertine, however, there was something more than this. Certainly, even at Balbec, in our daily encounters, I had always been surprised when she came in sight, so variable was her appearance from day to day. But now it was difficult to recognise her. Cleared of the pink vapour that used to bathe them, her features had emerged like those of a statue. She had another face, or rather she had a face at last; her body too had grown. There remained scarcely anything now of the shell in which she had been enclosed and on the surface of which, at Balbec, her future outline had been barely visible\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This time, Albertine had returned to Paris earlier than usual. As a rule she came only in the spring, which meant that, already disturbed for some weeks past by the storms that were beating down the first flowers, I did not distinguish, in the elements of the pleasure that I felt, the return of Albertine from that of the fine weather. It was enough that I should be told that she was in Paris and that she had called at the house, for me to see her again like a rose flowering by the sea. I cannot say whether it was the desire for Balbec or for herself that overcame me at such moments; possibly my desire for her was itself a lazy, cowardly, and incomplete method of possessing Balbec, as if to possess a thing materially, to take up one\u2019s abode in a town, were equivalent to possessing it spiritually. Besides, even materially, when she was no longer posed by my imagination before a horizon of sea, but sitting still in a room with me, she seemed to me often a very poor specimen of a rose, so poor, indeed, that I would gladly have shut my eyes in order not to observe this or that blemish of its petals, and to imagine instead that I was inhaling the salt air on the beach\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I must say it at this point, albeit I was not then aware of what was to happen only later on. Certainly, it is more reasonable to devote one\u2019s life to women than to postage stamps or old snuff-boxes, even to pictures or statues. Only the example of other collectors should be a warning to us to make changes, to have not one woman only but several. Those charming suggestions in which a girl abounds of a sea-beach, of the braided hair of a statue in church, of an old print, of everything that makes one see and admire in her, whenever she appears, a charming composition, those suggestions are not very stable. Live with a woman altogether and you will soon cease to see any of the things that made you love her; though I must add that these two sundered elements can be reunited by jealousy. If, after a long period of life in common, I was to end by seeing nothing more in Albertine than an ordinary woman, an intrigue between her and some person whom she had loved at Balbec would still suffice, perhaps, to reincorporate in her, to amalgamate the beach and the unrolling of the tide. Only, as these secondary suggestions no longer captivate our eyes, it is to the heart that they are perceptible and fatal. We cannot, under so dangerous a form, regard the repetition of the miracle as a thing to be desired. But I am anticipating the course of years. And here I need only state my regret that I did not have the sense simply to have kept my collection of women as people keep their collections of old quizzing glasses, never so complete, in their cabinet, that there is not room always for another and rarer still\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Departing from the customary order of her holiday movements, this year she had come straight from Balbec, where furthermore she had not stayed nearly so late as usual. It was a long time since I had seen her, and as I did not know even by name the people with whom she was in the habit of mixing in Paris, I could form no impression of her during the periods in which she abstained from coming to see me. These lasted often for quite a time. Then, one fine day, in would burst Albertine whose rosy apparitions and silent visits left me little if any better informed as to what she might have been doing in an interval which remained plunged in that darkness of her hidden life which my eyes felt little anxiety to pierce\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This time, however, certain signs seemed to indicate that some new experience must have entered into that life. And yet, perhaps, all that one was entitled to conclude from them was that girls change very rapidly at the age which Albertine had now reached. For instance, her intellect was now more in evidence, and on my reminding her of the day when she had insisted with so much ardour on the superiority of her idea of making Sophocles write: \u201cMy dear Racine,\u201d she was the first to laugh, quite wholeheartedly, at her own stupidity. \u201cAndr\u00e9e was quite right; it was stupid of me,\u201d she admitted. \u201cSophocles ought to have begun: \u2018Sir.\u2019\u201d I replied that the \u2018Sir,\u2019 and \u2018Dear Sir,\u2019 of Andr\u00e9e were no less comic than her own \u2018My dear Racine,\u2019 or Gis\u00e8le\u2019s \u2018My dear Friend,\u2019 but that after all the really stupid people were the Professors who still went on making Sophocles write letters to Racine. Here, however, Albertine was unable to follow me. She could not see in what the silliness consisted; her intelligence was dawning, but had not fully developed. There were other more attractive novelties in her; I felt, in this same pretty girl who had just sat down by my bed, something that was different; and in those lines which, in one\u2019s eyes and other features, express one\u2019s general attitude towards life, a change of front, a partial conversion, as though there had now been shattered those resistances against which I had hurled my strength in vain at Balbec, one evening, now remote in time, on which we formed a couple symmetrical with but the converse of our present arrangement, since then it had lieen she who was lying down and I who sat by her bedside. Wishing and not venturing to make certain whether now she would let herself be kissed, every time that she rose to go I asked her to stay beside me a little longer. This was a concession not very easy to obtain, for albeit she had nothing to do (otherwise she would have rushed from the house) she was a person methodical in her habits and moreover not very gracious towards me, scarcely to be at ease in my company, and yet each time, after looking at her watch, she sat down again at my request until finally she had spent several hours with me without my having asked her for anything; the things I was saying to her followed logically those that I had said during the hours before, and bore no relation to what I was thinking about, what I desired from her, remained indefinitely parallel. There is nothing like desire for preventing the thing one says from bearing any resemblance to what one has in one\u2019s mind. Time presses, and yet it seems as though we were seeking to gain time by speaking of subjects absolutely alien to that by which we are obsessed. We then arrange that the sentence which we should like to utter shall be accompanied, or rather preluded, by a gesture, supposing that is to say that we have not to give ourselves the pleasure of an immediate demonstration and to gratify the curiosity we feel as to the reactions which will follow it, without a word said, without even a \u2018By your leave,\u2019 already made this gesture. Certainly I was not in the least in love with Albertine; child of the mists outside, she could merely content the imaginative desire which the change of weather had awakened in me and which was midway between the desires that are satisfied by the arts of the kitchen and of monumental sculpture respectively, for it made me dream simultaneously of mingling with my flesh a substance different and warm, and of attaching at some point to my outstretched body a body divergent, as the body of Eve barely holds by the feet to the side of Adam, to whose body hers is almost perpendicular, in those romanesque bas-reliefs on the church at Balbec which represent in so noble and so reposeful a fashion, still almost like a classical frieze, the Creation of Woman; God in them is everywhere followed, as by two ministers, by two little angels in whom the visitor recognises \u2014 like winged, swarming summer creatures which winter has surprised and spared \u2014 cupids from Herculaneum, still surviving well into the thirteenth century, and winging their last slow flight, weary but never failing in the grace that might be expected of them, over the whole front of the porch\nYou might also like\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As for this pleasure which by accomplishing my desire would have set me free from these meditations and which I should have sought quite as readily from any other pretty woman, had I been asked upon what \u2014 in the course of this endless flow of talk throughout which I took care to keep from Albertine the one thing that was in my mind \u2014 was based my optimistic hypothesis with regard to her possible complaisances, I should perhaps have answered that this hypothesis was due (while the forgotten outlines of Albertine\u2019s voice retraced for me the contour of her personality) to the apparition of certain words which did not form part of her vocabulary, or at least not in the acceptation which she now gave them. Thus she said to roe that Elstir was stupid, and, on my protesting:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou don\u2019t understand,\u201d she replied, smiling, \u201cI mean that it was stupid of him to behave like that; of course I know he\u2019s quite a distinguished Person, really.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Similarly, wishing to say of the Fontainebleau golf club that it was smart, she declared: \u201cThey are quite a selection.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Speaking of a duel that I had fought, she said of my seconds: \u201cWhat very choice seconds,\u201d and looking at my face confessed that she would like to see me \u2018wear a moustache.\u2019 She even went so far (and my chance appeared then enormous) as to announce, in a phrase of which I would have sworn that she was ignorant a year earlier, that since she had last seen Gis\u00e8le there had passed a certain \u2018lapse of time.\u2019 This was not to say that Albertine had not already possessed, when I was at Balbec, a quite adequate assortment of those expressions which reveal at once that one\u2019s people are in easy circumstances, and which, year by year, a mother passes on to her daughter just as she bestows on her, gradually, as the girl grows up, on important occasions, her own jewels. It was evident that Albertine had ceased to be a little girl when one day, to express her thanks for a present which a strange lady had given her, she had said: \u201cI am quite confused.\u201d Mme. Bontemps could not help looking across at her husband whose comment was:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cGad, she\u2019s old for fourteen.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The approach of nubility had been more strongly marked still when Albertine, speaking of another girl whose tone was bad, said: \u201cOne can\u2019t even tell whether she\u2019s pretty, she paints her face a foot thick.\u201d Finally, though still a schoolgirl, she already displayed the manner of a grown woman of her upbringing and station when she said, of some one whose face twitched: \u201cI can\u2019t look at him, because it makes me want to do the same,\u201d or, if some one else were being imitated: \u201cThe absurd thing about it is that when you imitate her voice you look exactly like her.\u201d All these are drawn from the social treasury. But it did not seem to me possible that Albertine\u2019s natural environment could have supplied her with \u2018distinguished,\u2019 used in the sense in which my father would say of a colleague whom he had not actually met, but whose intellectual attainments he had heard praised: \u201cIt appears he\u2019s quite a distinguished person.\u201d \u2018Selection,\u2019 even when used of a golf club, seemed to me as incompatible with the Simonet family as it would be if preceded by the adjective \u2018Natural,\u2019 with a text published centuries before the researches of Darwin. \u2018Lapse of time\u2019 struck me as being of better augury still. Finally there appeared the evidence of certain upheavals, the nature of which was unknown to me, but sufficient to justify me in all my hopes when Albertine announced, with the satisfaction of a person whose opinion is by no means to be despised:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cTo my mind, that is the best thing that could possibly happen. I regard it as the best solution, the stylish way out.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This was so novel, so manifestly an alluvial deposit giving one to suspect such capricious wanderings over soil hitherto unknown to her, that on hearing the words \u2018to my mind\u2019 I drew Albertine towards me, and at \u2018I regard\u2019 made her sit on the side of my bed\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0No doubt it does happen that women of moderate culture, on marrying well-read men, receive such expressions as part of their paraphernalia. And shortly after the metamorphosis which follows the wedding night, when they begin to pay calls, and talk shyly to the friends of their girlhood, one notices with surprise that they have turned into matrons if, in deciding that some person is intelligent, they sound both l\u2019s in the word; but that is precisely the sign of a change of state, and I could see a difference when I thought of the vocabulary of the Albertine I had known of old \u2014 a vocabulary in which the most daring flights were to say of any unusual person: \u2018He\u2019s a type,\u2019 or, if you suggested a game of cards to her: \u2018I\u2019ve no money to lose,\u2019 or again, if any of her friends were to reproach her, in terms which she felt to be undeserved: \u2018That really is magnificent!\u2019 an expression dictated in such cases by a sort of middle-class tradition almost as old as the Magnificat itself, and one which a girl slightly out of temper and confident that she is in the right employs, as the saying is, \u2018quite naturally,\u2019 that is to say because she has learned the words from her mother, just as she has learned to say her prayers or to greet a friend. All these expressions Mme. Bontemps had imparted to her at the same time as her hatred of the Jews and her feeling for black, which was always suitable and becoming, indeed without any formal instruction, but as the piping of the parent goldfinches serves as a model for that of the young ones, recently hatched, so that they in turn grow into true goldfinches also. But when all was said, \u2018selection\u2019 appeared to me of alien growth and \u2018I regard\u2019 encouraging. Albertine was no longer the same; which meant that she would not perhaps act, would not react in the same way\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Not only did I no longer feel any love for her, but I had no longer to consider, as I should have had at Balbec, the risk of shattering in her an affection for myself, which no longer existed. There could be no doubt that she had long since become quite indifferent to me. I was well aware that to her I was in no sense a member now of the \u2018little band\u2019 into which I had at one time so anxiously sought and had then been so happy to have secured admission. Besides, as she had no longer even, as in Balbec days, an air of frank good nature, I felt no serious scruples: still I believe that what made me finally decide was another philological discovery. As, continuing to add fresh links to the external chain of talk behind which I hid my intimate desire, I spoke, having Albertine secure now on the corner of my bed, of one of the girls of the little band, one smaller than the rest, whom, nevertheless, I had thought quite pretty, \u201cYes,\u201d answered Albertine, \u201cshe reminds me of a little mousm\u00e9.\u201d There had been nothing in the world to shew, when I first knew Albertine, that she had ever heard the wordmousm\u00e9. It was probable that, had things followed their normal course, she would never have learned it, and for my part I should have seen no cause for regret in that, for there is no more horrible word in the language. The mere sound of it makes one\u2019s teeth ache as they do when one has put too large a spoonful of ice in one\u2019s mouth. But coming from Albertine, as she sat there looking so pretty, not even \u2018mousm\u00e9\u2018 could strike me as unpleasant. On the contrary, I felt it to be a revelation, if not of an outward initiation, at any rate of an inward evolution. Unfortunately it was now time for me to bid her good-bye if I wished her to reach home in time for her dinner, and myself to be out of bed and dressed in time for my own. It was Fran\u00e7oise who was getting it ready; she did not like having to keep it back, and must already have found it an infringement of one of the articles of her code that Albertine, in the absence of my parents, should be paying me so prolonged a visit, and one which was going to make everything late. But before \u2018mousm\u00e9\u2018 all these arguments fell to the ground and I hastened to say:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cJust fancy; I\u2019m not in the least ticklish; you can go on tickling me for an hour on end and I won\u2019t even feel it.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cReally?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI assure you.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She understood, doubtless, that this was the awkward expression of a desire on my part, for, like a person who offers to give you an introduction for which you have not ventured to ask him, though what you have said has shewn him that it would be of great service to you\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWould you like me to try?\u201d she inquired, with womanly meekness\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cJust as you like, but you would be more comfortable if you lay down properly on the bed.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cLike that?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo; get right on top.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019re sure I\u2019m not too heavy?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As she uttered these words the door opened and Fran\u00e7oise, carrying a lamp, came in. Albertine had just time to fling herself back upon her chair. Perhaps Fran\u00e7oise had chosen this moment to confound us, having been listening at the door or even peeping through the keyhole. But there was no need to suppose anything of the sort; she might have scorned to assure herself, by the use of her eyes, of what her instinct must plainly enough have detected, for by dint of living with me and my parents her fears, her prudence, her alertness, her cunning had ended by giving her that instinctive and almost prophetic knowledge of us all that the mariner has of the sea, the quarry of the hunter, and, of the malady, if not the physician, often at any rate the patient. The amount of knowledge that she managed to acquire would have astounded a stranger, and with as good reason as does the advanced state of certain arts and sciences among the ancients, seeing that there was practically no source of information open to them. (Her sources were no larger. They were a few casual remarks forming barely a twentieth part of our conversation at dinner, caught on the wing by the butler and inaccurately transmitted to the kitchen.) Again, her mistakes were due, like theirs, like the fables in which Plato believed, rather to a false conception of the world and to preconceived ideas than to the insufficiency of the materials at her disposal. Only the other day, has it not been possible for the most important discoveries as to the habits of insects to be made by a scientist who had access to no laboratory and used no instruments of any sort? But if the drawbacks arising from her menial position had not prevented her from acquiring a stock of learning indispensable to the art which was its ultimate goal \u2014 and which consisted in putting us to confusion by communicating to us the results of her discoveries \u2014 the limitations under which she worked had done more; in this case the impediment, not content with merely not paralysing the flight of her imagination, had greatly strengthened it. Of course Fran\u00e7oise never let slip any artificial device, those for example of diction and attitude. Since (if she never believed what we said to her, hoping that she would believe it) she admitted without any shadow of doubt the truth of anything that any person of her own condition in life might tell her, however absurd, which might at the same time prove shocking to our ideas, just as her way of listening to our assertions bore witness to her incredulity, so the accents in which she reported (the use of indirect speech enabling her to hurl the most deadly insults at us with impunity) the narrative of a cook who had told her how she had threatened her employers, and won from them, by treating them before all the world like dirt, any number of privileges and concessions, shewed that the story was to her as gospel. Fran\u00e7oise went so far as to add: \u201cI\u2019m sure, if I had been the mistress I should have been quite vexed.\u201d In vain might we, despite our scant sympathy at first with the lady on the fourth floor, shrug our shoulders, as though at an unlikely fable, at this report of so shocking an example; in making it the teller was able to speak with the crushing, the lacerating force of the most unquestionable, most irritating affirmation\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But above all, just as great writers often attain to a power of concentration from which they would have been dispensed under a system of political liberty or literary anarchy, when they are bound by the tyranny of a monarch or of a school of poetry, by the severity of prosodie laws or of a state religion, so Fran\u00e7oise, not being able to reply to us in an explicit fashion, spoke like Tiresias and would have written like Tacitus. She managed to embody everything that she could not express directly in a sentence for which we could not find fault with her without accusing ourselves, indeed in less than a sentence, in a silence, in the way in which she placed a thing in a room\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus when I happened to leave, by accident, on my table, among a pile of other letters, one which it was imperative that she should not see, because, let us say, it referred to her with a dislike which afforded a presumption of the same feeling towards her in the recipient as in the writer, that evening, if I came home with a troubled conscience and went straight to my room, there on top of my letters, neatly arranged in a symmetrical pile, the compromising document caught my eye as it could not possibly have failed to catch the eye of Fran\u00e7oise, placed by her right at the top, almost separated from the rest, in a prominence that was a form of speech, that had an eloquence all its own, and, as I stood in the doorway, made me shudder like a cry. She excelled in the preparation of these scenic effects, intended so to enlighten the spectator, in her absence, that he already knew that she knew everything when in due course she made her appearance. She possessed, for thus making an inanimate object speak, the art, at once inspired and painstaking, of Irving or Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lema\u00eetre. On this occasion, holding over Albertine and myself the lighted lamp whose searching beams missed none of the still visible depressions which the girl\u2019s body had hollowed in the counterpane, Fran\u00e7oise made one think of a picture of \u2018Justice throwing light upon Crime.\u2019 Albertine\u2019s face did not suffer by this illumination. It revealed on her cheeks the same sunny burnish that had charmed me at Balbec. This face of Albertine, the general effect of Which sometimes was, out of doors, a sort of milky pallor, now shewed, according as the lamp shone on them, surfaces so dazzlingly, so uniformly coloured, so firm, so glowing that one might have compared them to the sustained flesh tints of certain flowers. Taken aback meanwhile by the unexpected entry of Fran\u00e7oise, I exclaimed:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat? The lamp already? I say, the light is strong!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My object, as may be imagined, was by the second of these ejaculations to account for my confusion, by the first to excuse my lateness in rising. Fran\u00e7oise replied with a cruel ambiguity:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDo you want me to extinglish it?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201c\u2014 guish!\u201d Albertine slipped into my ear, leaving me charmed by the familiar vivacity with which, taking me at once for teacher and for accomplice, she insinuated this psychological affirmation as though asking a grammatical question. When Fran\u00e7oise had left the room and Albertine was seated once again on my bed:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDo you know what I\u2019m afraid of?\u201d I asked her. \u201cIt is that if we go on like this I may not be able to resist the temptation to kiss you.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThat would be a fine pity.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I did not respond at once to this invitation, which another man might even have found superfluous, for Albertine\u2019s way of pronouncing her words was so carnal, so seductive that merely in speaking to you she seemed to be caressing you. A word from her was a favour, and her conversation covered you with kisses. And yet it was highly attractive to me, this invitation. It would have been so, indeed, coming from any pretty girl of Albertine\u2019s age; but that Albertine should be now so accessible to me gave me more than pleasure, brought before my eyes a series of images that bore the stamp of beauty. I recalled the original Albertine standing between me and the beach, almost painted upon a background of sea, having for me no more real existence than those figures seen on the stage, when one knows not whether one is looking at the actress herself who is supposed to appear, at an understudy who for the moment is taking her principal\u2019s part, or at a mere projection from a lantern. Then the real woman had detached herself from the luminous mass, had come towards me, with the sole result that I had been able to see that she had nothing in real life of that amorous facility which one supposed to be stamped upon her in the magic pictures. I had learned that it was not possible to touch her, to embrace her, that one might only talk to her, that\u2019 for me she was no more a woman than the jade grapes, an inedible decoration at one time in fashion on dinner tables, are really fruit. And now she was appearing to me in a third plane, real as in the second experience that I had had of her but facile as in the first; facile, and all the more deliciously so in that I had so long imagined that she was not. My surplus knowledge of life (of a life less uniform, less simple than I had at first supposed it to be) inclined me provisionally towards agnosticism. What can one positively affirm, when the thing that one thought probable at first has then shewn itself to be false and in the third instance turns out true? And alas, I was not yet at the end of my discoveries with regard to Albertine. In any case, even if there had not been the romantic attraction of this disclosure of a greater wealth of planes revealed one after another by life (an attraction the opposite of that which Saint-Loup had felt during our dinners at Rivebelle on recognising beneath the mask with which the course of existence had overlaid them, in a calm face, features to which his lips had once been pressed), the knowledge that to kiss Albertine\u2019s cheeks was a possible thing was a pleasure perhaps greater even than that of kissing them. What a difference between possessing a woman to whom one applies one\u2019s body alone, because she is no more than a piece of flesh, and possessing the girl whom one used to see on the beach with her friends on certain days without even knowing why one saw her on those days and not on others, which made one tremble to think that one might not see her again. Life had obligingly revealed to one in its whole extent the romance of this little girl, had lent one, for the study of her, first one optical instrument, then another, and had added to one\u2019s carnal desire an accompaniment which multiplied it an hundredfold and diversified it with those other desires, more spiritual and less easily assuaged, which do not emerge from their torpor, leaving carnal desire to move by itself, when it aims only at the conquest of a piece of flesh, but which to gain possession of a whole tract of memories, whence they have felt the wretchedness of exile, rise in a tempest round about it, enlarge, extend it, are unable to follow it to the accomplishment, the assimilation, impossible in the form in which it is looked for, of an immaterial reality, but wait for this desire halfway and at the moment of recollection, of return furnish it afresh with their escort; to kiss, instead of the cheeks of the first comer, however cool and fresh they might be, but anonymous, with no secret, with no distinction, those of which I had so long been dreaming, would be to know the taste, the savour of a colour on which I had endlessly gazed. One has seen a woman, a mere image in the decorative setting of life, like Albertine, outlined against the sea, and then one has been able to take that image, to detach it, to bring it close to oneself, gradually to discern its solidity, its colours, as though one had placed it behind the glasses of a stereoscope. It is for this reason that the women who are a little difficult, whose resistance one does not at once overcome, of whom one does not indeed know at first whether one ever will overcome it, are alone interesting. For to know them, to approach them, to conquer them is to make fluctuate in form, in dimensions, in relief the human image, is an example of relativity in the appreciation of an image which it is delightful to see afresh when it has resumed the slender proportions of a silhouette in the setting of one\u2019s life. The women one meets first of all in a brothel are of no interest because they remain invariable\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, Albertine preserved, inseparably attached to her, all my impressions of a series of seascapes of which I was particularly fond. I felt that it was possible for me, on the girl\u2019s two cheeks, to kiss the whole of the beach at Balbec\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIf you really don\u2019t mind my kissing you, I would rather put it off for a little and choose a good moment. Only you mustn\u2019t forget that you\u2019ve said I may. I shall want a voucher: \u2018Valid for one kiss.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cShall I have to sign it?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut if I took it now, should I be entitled to another later on?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou do make me laugh with your vouchers; I shall issue a new one every now and then.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cTell me; just one thing more. You know, at Balbec, before I had been introduced to you, you used often to have a hard, calculating look; you can\u2019t tell me what you were thinking about when you looked like that?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo; I don\u2019t remember at all.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWait; this may remind you: one day your friend Gis\u00e8le put her feet together and jumped over the chair an old gentleman was sitting in. Try to remember what was in your mind at that moment.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cGis\u00e8le was the one we saw least of; she did belong to the band, I suppose, but not properly. I expect I thought that she was very ill-bred and common.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, is that all?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I should certainly have liked, before kissing her, to be able to fill her afresh with the mystery which she had had for me on the beach before I knew her, to find latent in her the place in which she had lived earlier still; for that, at any rate, if I knew nothing of it, I could substitute all my memories of our life at Balbec, the sound of the waves rolling up and breaking beneath my window, the shouts of the children. But when I let my eyes glide over the charming pink globe of her cheeks, the gently curving surfaces of which ran up to expire beneath the first foothills of her piled black tresses which ran in undulating mountain chains, thrust out escarped ramparts and moulded the hollows of deep valleys, I could not help saying to myself: \u201cNow at last, after failing at Balbec, I am going to learn the fragrance of the secret rose that blooms in Albertine\u2019s cheeks, and, since the cycles through which we are able to make things and people pass in the course of our existence are comparatively few, perhaps I ought now to regard mine as nearing its end when, having made to emerge from its remoteness the flowering face that I had chosen from among all others, I shall have brought it into this new plane in which I shall at last acquire a tactual experience of it with my lips.\u201d I told myself this because I believed that there was such a thing as knowledge acquired by the lips; I told myself that I was going to know the taste of this fleshly rose, because I had never stopped to think that man, a creature obviously less rudimentary in structure than the sea-urchin or even the whale, is nevertheless still unprovided with a certain number of essential organs, and notably possesses none that will serve for kissing. The place of this absent organ he supplies with his lips, and thereby arrives perhaps at a slightly more satisfying result than if he were reduced to caressing the beloved with a horny tusk. But a pair of lips, designed to convey to the palate the taste of whatever whets the appetite, must be content, without ever realising their mistake or admitting their disappointment, with roaming over the surface and with coming to a halt at the barrier of the impenetrable but irresistible cheek. Besides, at such moments, at the actual contact between flesh and flesh, the lips, even supposing them to become more expert and better endowed, could taste no better probably the savour which nature prevents their ever actually grasping, for in that desolate zone in which they are unable to find their proper nourishment, they are alone; the sense of sight, then that of smell have long since deserted them. To begin with, as my mouth began gradually to approach the cheeks which my eyes had suggested to it that it should kiss, my eyes, changing their position, saw a different pair of cheeks; the throat, studied at closer range and as though through a magnifying glass shewed in its coarse grain a robustness which modified the character of the face\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Apart from the most recent applications of the art of photography \u2014 which set crouching at the foot of a cathedral all the houses which, time and again, when we stood near them, have appeared to us to reach almost to the height of the towers, drill and deploy like a regiment, in file, in open order, in mass, the same famous and familiar structures, bring into actual contact the two columns on the Piazzetta which a moment ago were so far apart, thrust away the adjoining dome of the Salute, and in a pale and toneless background manage to include a whole immense horizon within the span of a bridge, in the embrasure of a window, among the leaves of a tree that stands in the foreground and is portrayed in a more vigorous tone, give successively as setting to the same church the arched walls of all the others \u2014 I can think of nothing that can so effectively as a kiss evoke from what we believe to be a thing with one definite aspect, the hundred other things which it may equally well be since each is related to a view of it no less legitimate. In short, just as at Balbec Albertine had often appeared to me different, so now, as if, wildly accelerating the speed of the changes of aspect and changes of colouring which a person presents to us in the course of our various encounters, I had sought to contain them all in the space of a few seconds so as to reproduce experimentally the phenomenon which diversifies the individuality of a fellow creature, and to draw out one from another, like a nest of boxes, all the possibilities that it contains, in this brief passage of my lips towards her cheek it was ten Albertines that I saw; this single girl being like a goddess with several heads, that which I had last seen, if I tried to approach it, gave place to another. At least so long as I had not touched it, that head, I could still see it, a faint perfume reached me from it. But alas \u2014 for in this matter of kissing our nostrils and eyes are as ill placed as our lips are shaped \u2014 suddenly my eyes ceased to see; next, my nose, crushed by the collision, no longer perceived any fragrance, and, without thereby gaining any clearer idea of the taste of the rose of my desire, I learned, from these unpleasant signs, that at last I was in the act of kissing Albertine\u2019s cheek\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Was it because we were enacting \u2014 as may be illustrated by the rotation of a solid body \u2014 the converse of our scene together at Balbec, because it was I, now, who was lying in bed and she who sat beside me, capable of evading any brutal attack and of dictating her pleasure to me, that she allowed me to take so easily now what she had refused me on the former occasion with so forbidding a frown? (No doubt from that same frown the voluptuous expression which her face assumed now at the approach of my lips differed only by a deviation of its lines immeasurably minute but one in which may be contained all the disparity that there is between the gesture of \u2018finishing off\u2019 a wounded man and that of bringing him relief, between a sublime and a hideous portrait.) Not knowing whether I had to give the credit, and to feel grateful for this change of attitude to some unwitting benefactor who in these last months, in Paris or at Balbec, had been working on my behalf, I supposed that the respective positions in which we were now placed might account for it. It was quite another explanation, however, that Albertine offered me; this, in short: \u201cOh, well, you see, that time at Balbec I didn\u2019t know you properly. For all I knew, you might have meant mischief.\u201d This argument left me in perplexity. Albertine was no doubt sincere in advancing it. So difficult is it for a woman to recognise in the movements of her limbs, in the sensations felt by her body in the course of an intimate conversation with a friend, the unknown sin into which she would tremble to think that a stranger was planning her fall\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In any case, whatever the modifications that had occurred at some recent time in her life, which might perhaps have explained why it was that she now readily accorded to my momentary and purely physical desire what at Balbec she had with horror refused to allow to my love, another far more surprising manifested itself in Albertine that same evening as soon as her caresses had procured in me the satisfaction which she could not have failed to notice, which, indeed, I had been afraid might provoke in her the instinctive movement of revulsion and offended modesty which Gilberte had given at a corresponding moment behind the laurel shrubbery in the Champs-Elys\u00e9es\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The exact opposite happened. Already, when I had first made her lie on my bed and had begun to fondle her, Albertine had assumed an air which I did not remember in her, of docile good will, of an almost childish simplicity. Obliterating every trace of her customary anxieties and interests, the moment preceding pleasure, similar in this respect to the moment after death, had restored to her rejuvenated features what seemed like the innocence of earliest childhood. And no doubt everyone whose special talent is suddenly brought into play becomes modest, devoted, charming; especially if by this talent he knows that he is giving us a great pleasure, he is himself happy in the display of it, anxious to present it to us in as complete a form as possible. But in this new expression on Albertine\u2019s face there was more than a mere profession of disinterestedness, conscience, generosity, a sort of conventional and unexpected devotion; and it was farther than to her own childhood, it was to the infancy of the race that she had reverted. Very different from myself who had looked for nothing more than a physical alleviation, which I had finally secured, Albertine seemed to feel that it would indicate a certain coarseness on her part were she to seem to believe that this material pleasure could be unaccompanied by a moral sentiment or was to be regarded as terminating anything. She, who had been in so great a hurry a moment ago, now, presumably because she felt that kisses implied love and that love took precedence of all other duties, said when I reminded her of her dinner:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, but that doesn\u2019t matter in the least; I have plenty of time.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She seemed embarrassed by the idea of getting up and going immediately after what had happened, embarrassed by good manners, just as Fran\u00e7oise when, without feeling thirsty, she had felt herself bound to accept with a seemly gaiety the glass of wine which Jupien offered her, would never have dared to leave him as soon as the last drops were drained, however urgent the call of duty. Albertine \u2014 and this was perhaps, with another which the reader will learn in due course, one of the reasons which bad made me unconsciously desire her \u2014 was one of the incarnations of the little French peasant whose type may be seen in stone at Saint-Andr\u00e9-des-Champs. As in Fran\u00e7oise, who presently nevertheless was to become her deadly enemy, I recognised in her a courtesy towards friend and stranger, a sense of decency, of respect for the bedside\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fran\u00e7oise who, after the death of my aunt, felt obliged to speak only in a plaintive tone, would, in the months that preceded her daughter\u2019s marriage, have been quite shocked if, when the young couple walked out together, the girl had not taken her lover\u2019s arm. Albertine lying motionless beside me said:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat nice hair you have; what nice eyes; you are a dear boy.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When, after pointing out to her that it was getting late, I added: \u201cYou don\u2019t believe me?\u201d she replied, what was perhaps true but could be so only since the minute before and for the next few hours:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI always believe you.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She spoke to me of myself, my family, my social position. She said: \u201cOh, I know your parents know some very nice people. You are a friend of Robert Forestier and Suzanne Delage.\u201d For the moment these names conveyed absolutely nothing to me. But suddenly I remembered that I had indeed played as a child in the Champs-Elys\u00e9es with Robert Forestier, whom I had never seen since then. As for Suzanne Delage, she was the great-niece of Mme. Blatin, and I had once been going to a dancing lesson, and had even promised to take a small part in a play that was being acted in her mother\u2019s drawing-room. But the fear of being sent into fits of laughter, and of a bleeding nose, had made me decline, so that I had never set eyes on her. I had at the most a vague idea that I had once heard that the Swanns\u2019 governess with the feather in her hat had at one time been with the Delages, but perhaps it was only a sister of this governess, or a friend. I protested to Albertine that Robert Forestier and Suzanne Delage occupied a very small place in my life. \u201cThat may be; but your mothers are friends, I can place you by that. I often pass Suzanne Delage in the Avenue de Messine, I admire her style.\u201d Our mothers were acquainted only in the imagination of Mme. Bontemps, who having heard that I had at one time played with Robert Forestier, to whom, it appeared, I used to recite poetry, had concluded from that that we were bound by family ties. She could never, I gathered, hear my mother\u2019s name mentioned without observing: \u201cOh, yes, she is in the Delage Forestier set,\u201d giving my parents a good mark which they had done nothing to deserve\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Apart from this, Albertine\u2019s social ideas were fatuous in the extreme. She regarded the Simonnets with a double \u2018n\u2019 as inferior not only to the Simonets with a single \u2018n\u2019 but to everyone in the world. That some one else should bear the same name as yourself without belonging to your family is an excellent reason for despising him. Of course there are exceptions. It may happen that two Simonnets (introduced to one another at one of those gatherings where one feels the need to converse, no matter on what subject, and where moreover one is instinctively well disposed towards strangers, for instance in a funeral procession on its way to the cemetery), finding that they have the same name, will seek with a mutual friendliness though without success to discover a possible connexion. But that is only an exception. Plenty of people are of dubious character, but we either know nothing or care nothing about them. If, however, a similarity of names brings to our door letters addressed to them, or vice versa, we at once feel a mistrust, often justified, as to their moral worth. We are afraid of being confused with them, we forestall the mistake by a grimace of disgust when anyone refers to them in our hearing. When we read our own name, as borne by them, in the newspaper, they seem to have usurped it. The transgressions of other members of the social organism leave us cold. We lay the burden of them more heavily upon our namesakes. The hatred which we bear towards the other Simonnets is all the stronger in that it is not a personal feeling but has been transmitted by heredity. After the second generation we remember only the expression of disgust with which our grandparents used to refer to the other Simonnets, we know nothing of the reason, we should not be surprised to learn that it had begun with a murder. Until, as is not uncommon, the time comes when a male and female Simonnet, who are not related in any way, are joined together in matrimony and so repair the breach\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Not only did Albertine speak to me of Robert Forestier and Suzanne Delage, but spontaneously, with that impulse to confide which the approximation of two human bodies creates, that is to say at first, before it has engendered a special duplicity and reticence in one person towards the other, she told me a story about her own family and one of Andr\u00e9e\u2019s uncles, as to which, at Balbec, she had refused to utter a word; thinking that now she ought not to appear to have any secrets in which I might not share. From this moment, had her dearest friend said anything to her against me, she would have made it her duty to inform me. I insisted upon her going home, and finally she did go, but so ashamed on my account at my discourtesy that she laughed almost as though to apologise for me, as a hostess to whose party you have gone without dressing makes the best of you but is offended nevertheless\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAre you laughing at me?\u201d I inquired\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI am not laughing, I am smiling at you,\u201d she replied lovingly. \u201cWhen am I going to see you again?\u201d she went on, as though declining to admit that what had just happened between us, since it is generally the crowning consummation, might not be at least the prelude to a great friendship, a friendship already existing which we should have to discover, to confess, and which alone could account for the surrender we had made of ourselves\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSince you give me leave, I shall send for you when I can.\u201d I dared not let her know that I was subordinating everything else to the chance of seeing Mme. de Stermaria. \u201cIt will have to be at short notice, unfortunately,\u201d I went on, \u201cI never know beforehand. Would it be possible for me to send round for you in the evenings, when I am free?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt will be quite possible in a little while, I am going to have a latch-key of my own. But just at present it can\u2019t be done. Anyhow I shall come round to-morrow or next day in the afternoon. You needn\u2019t see me if you\u2019re busy.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On reaching the door, surprised that I had not anticipated her, she offered me her cheek, feeling that there was no need now for any coarse physical desire to prompt us to kiss one another. The brief relations in which we had just indulged being of the sort to which an absolute intimacy and a heartfelt choice often tend, Albertine had felt it incumbent upon her to improvise and add provisionally to the kisses which we had exchanged on my bed the sentiment of which those kisses would have been the symbol for a knight and his lady such as they might have been conceived in the mind of a gothic minstrel\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When she had left me, this young Picard, who might have been carved on his porch by the image-maker of Saint-Andr\u00e9-des-Champs, Fran\u00e7oise brought me a letter which filled me with joy, for it was from Mme. de Stermaria, who accepted my invitation to dinner. From Mme. de Stermaria, that was to say for me not so much from the real Mme. de Stermaria as from her of whom I had been thinking all day before Albertine\u2019s arrival. It is the terrible deception of love that it begins by engaging us in play not with a woman of the external world but with a puppet fashioned and kept in our brain, the only form of her moreover that we have always at our disposal, the only one that we shall ever possess, one which the arbitrary power of memory, almost as absolute as that of imagination, may have made as different from the real woman as had been from the real Balbec the Balbec of my dreams; an artificial creation to which by degrees, and to our own hurt, we shall force the real woman into resemblance\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Albertine had made me so late that the play had just finished when I entered Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s drawing-room; and having little desire to be caught in the stream of guests who were pouring out, discussing the great piece of news, the separation, said to be already effected, of the Duc de Guermantes from his wife, I had, until I should have an opportunity of shaking hands with my hostess, taken my seat on an empty sofa in the outer room, when from the other, in which she had no doubt had her chair in the very front row of all, I saw emerging, majestic, ample and tall in a flowing gown of yellow satin upon which stood out in relief huge black poppies, the Duchess herself. The sight of her no longer disturbed me in the least. There had been a day when, laying her hands on my forehead (as was her habit when she was afraid of hurting my feelings) and saying: \u201cYou really must stop hanging about trying to meet Mme. de Guermantes. All the neighbours are talking about you. Besides, look how ill your grandmother is, you really have something more serious to think about than waylaying a woman who only laughs at you,\u201d in a moment, like a hypnotist who brings one back from the distant country in which one imagined oneself to be, and opens one\u2019s eyes for one, or like the doctor who, by recalling one to a sense of duty and reality, cures one of an imaginary disease in which one has been indulging one\u2019s fancy, my mother had awakened me from an unduly protracted dream. The rest of the day had been consecrated to a last farewell to this malady which I was renouncing; I had sung, for hours on end and weeping as I sang, the sad words of Schubert\u2019s Adieu:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Farewell, strange voices call thee\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Away from me, dear sister of the angels\n\nAnd then it had finished. I had given up my morning walks, and with so little difficulty that I thought myself justified in the prophecy (which we shall see was to prove false later on) that I should easily grow accustomed in the course of my life to ceasing to see a woman. And when, shortly afterwards, Fran\u00e7oise had reported to me that Jupien, anxious to enlarge his business, was looking for a shop in the neighbourhood, wishing to find one for him (quite happy, moreover, when strolling along a street which already from my bed I had heard luminously vociferous like a peopled beach, to see behind the raised iron shutters of the dairies the young milk-girls with their white sleeves), I had been able to begin these excursions again. Nor did I feel the slightest constraint; for I was conscious that I was no longer going out with the object of seeing Mme. de Guermantes; much as a married woman who takes endless precautions so long as she has a lover, from the day on which she has broken with him leaves his letters lying about, at the risk of disclosing to her husband an infidelity which ceased to alarm her the moment she ceased to be guilty of it. What troubled me now was the discovery that almost every house sheltered some unhappy person. In one the wife was always in tears because her husband was unfaithful to her. In the next it was the other way about. In another a hardworking mother, beaten black and blue by a drunkard son, was endeavouring to conceal her sufferings from the eyes of the neighbours. Quite half of the human race was in tears. And when I came to know the people who composed it I saw that they were so exasperating that I asked myself whether it might not be the adulterous husband and wife (who were so simply because their lawful happiness had been withheld from them, and shewed themselves charming and faithful to everyone but their respective wife and husband) who were in the right. Presently I ceased to have even the excuse of being useful to Jupien for continuing my morning wanderings. For we learned that the cabinet-maker in our courtyard, whose workrooms were separated from Jupien\u2019s shop only by the flimsiest of partitions, was shortly to be \u2018given notice\u2019 by the Duke\u2019s agent because his hammering made too much noise. Jupien could have hoped for nothing better; the workrooms had a basement for storing timber, which communicated with our cellars. He could keep his coal in this, he could knock down the partition, and would then have a huge shop all in one room. But even without the amusement of house-hunting on his behalf I had continued to go out every day before luncheon, just as Jupien himself, finding the rent that M. de Guermantes was asking him exorbitant, was allowing the premises to be inspected in the hope that,discouraged by his failure to find a tenant, the Duke would resign himself to accepting a lower offer. Fran\u00e7oise, noticing that, even at an hour when no prospective tenant was likely to call, the porter left the door of the empty shop on the latch, scented a trap laid by him to entice the young woman who was engaged to the Guer \u2014 mantes footman (they would find a lovers\u2019 retreat there) and to catch them red-handed\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However that might be, and for all that I had no longer to find Jupien a new shop, I still went out before luncheon. Often, on these excursions, I met M. de Norpois. It would happen that, conversing as he walked with a colleague, he cast at me a glance which after making a thorough scrutiny of my person returned to his companion without his having smiled at me or given me any more sign of recognition than if he had never set eyes on me before. For, with these eminent diplomats, looking at you in a certain way is intended to let you know not that they have seen you but that they have not seen you and that they have some serious question to discuss with the colleague who is accompanying them. A tall woman whom I frequently encountered near the house was less discreet with me. For in spite of the fact that I did not know her, she would turn round to look at me, would wait for me, unavailingly, before shop windows, smile at me as though she were going to kiss me, make gestures indicative of a complete surrender. She resumed an icy coldness towards me if anyone appeared whom she knew. For a long time now in these morning walks, thinking only of what I had to do, were it but the most trivial purchase of a newspaper, I had chosen the shortest way, with no regret were it outside the ordinary course which the Duchess followed in her walks, and if on the other hand it lay along that course, without either compunction or concealment, because it no longer appeared to me the forbidden way on which I should snatch from an ungrateful woman the favour of setting eyes on her against her will. But it had never occurred to me that my recovery, when it restored me to a normal attitude towards Mme. de Guermantes, would have a corresponding effect on her, and so render possible a friendliness, even a friendship in which I no longer felt any interest. Until then, the efforts of the entire world banded together to bring me into touch with her would have been powerless to counteract the evil spell that is cast by an ill-starred love. Fairies more powerful than mankind have decreed that in such cases nothing can avail us until the day on which we have uttered sincerely and from our hearts the formula: \u201cI am no longer in love.\u201d I had been vexed with Saint-Loup for not having taken me to see his aunt. But he was no more capable than anyone else of breaking an enchantment. So long as I was in love with Mme. de Guermantes, the marks of politeness that \u00ef received from others, their compliments actually distressed me, not only because they did not come from her but because she would never hear of them. And yet even if she had known of them it would not have been of the slightest use to me. Indeed, among the lesser auxiliaries to success in iove, an absence, the declining of an invitation to dinner, an unintentional, unconscious harshness are of more service than all the cosmetics and fine clothes in the world. There would be plenty of social success, were people taught upon these lines the art of succeeding\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As she swept through the room in which I was sitting, her mind filled with thoughts of friends whom I did not know and whom she would perhaps be meeting presently at some other party, Mme. de Guermantes caught sight of me on my sofa, genuinely indifferent and seeking only to be polite whereas while I was in love I had tried so desperately, without ever succeeding, to assume an air of indifference; she swerved aside, came towards me and, reproducing the smile she had worn that evening at the Op\u00e9ra-Comique, which the unpleasant feeling of being cared for by some one for whom she did not care was no longer there to obliterate: \u201cNo, don\u2019t move; you don\u2019t mind if I sit down beside you for a moment?\u201d she asked, gracefully gathering in her immense skirt which otherwise would have covered the entire sofa\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Of less stature than she, who was further expanded by the volume of her gown, I was almost brushed by her exquisite bare arm round which a faint, innumerable down rose in perpetual smoke like a golden mist, and by the fringe of her fair tresses which wafted their fragrance over me. Having barely room to sit down, she could not turn easily to face me, and so obliged to look straight before her rather than in my direction, assumed the sort of dreamy, sweet expression one sees in a portrait\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHave you any news of Robert?\u201d she inquired\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At that moment Mme. de Villeparisis entered the room\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWell, Sir, you arrive at a fine time, when we do see you here for once in a way!\u201d And noticing that I was talking to her niece, concluding, perhaps, that we were more intimate than she had supposed: \u201cBut don\u2019t let me interrupt your conversation with Oriane,\u201d she went on, and (for these good offices as pander are part of the duties of the perfect hostess): \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t care to dine with her here on Thursday?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was the day on which I was to entertain Mme. de Stermaria, so I declined\n\u201cSaturday, then?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As my mother was returning on Saturday or Sunday, it would never do for me not to stay at home every evening to dine with her; I therefore declined this invitation also\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAh, you\u2019re not an easy person to get hold of.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhy do you never come to see me?\u201d inquired Mme. de Guermantes when Mme. de Villeparisis had left us to go and congratulate the performers and present the leading lady with a bunch of roses upon which the hand that offered it conferred all its value, for it had cost no more than twenty francs. (This, incidentally, was as high as she ever went when an artist had performed only once. Those who gave their services at all her afternoons and evenings throughout the season received roses painted by the Marquise.)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s such a bore that we never see each other except in other people\u2019s houses. Since you won\u2019t meet me at dinner at my aunt\u2019s, why not come and dine with me?\u201d Various people who had stayed to the last possible moment, upon one pretext or another, but were at length preparing to leave, seeing that the Duchess had sat down to talk to a young man on a seat so narrow as just to contain them both, thought that they must have been misinformed, that it was the Duchess, and not the Duke, who was seeking a separation, and on my account. Whereupon they hastened to spread abroad this intelligence. I had better grounds than anyone to be aware of its falsehood. But I was myself surprised that at one of those difficult periods in which a separation that is not yet completed is beginning to take effect, the Duchess, instead of withdrawing from society should go out of her way to invite a \u2014 person whom she knew so slightly. The suspicion crossed my mind that it had been the Duke alone who had been opposed to her having me in the house, and that now that he was leaving her she saw no further obstacle to her surrounding herself with the people that she liked\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A minute earlier I should have been stupefied had anyone told me that Mme. de Guermantes was going to ask me to call on her, let alone to dine with her. I might be perfectly aware that the Guermantes drawing-room could not furnish those particular refinements which I had extracted from the name of its occupants, the fact that it had been forbidden ground to me, by obliging me to give it the same kind of existence that we give to the drawing-rooms of which we have read the description in a novel, or seen the image in a dream, made me, even when I was certain that it was just like any other, imagine it as quite different. Between myself and it was the barrier at which reality ends. To dine with the Guermantes was like travelling to a place I had long wished to see, making a desire emerge from my brain and take shape before my eyes, forming acquaintance with a dream. At the most, I might have supposed that it would be one of those dinners to which one\u2019s hosts invite one with: \u201cDo come; there\u2019ll beabsolutely nobody but ourselves,\u201d pretending to attribute to the pariah the alarm which they themselves feel at the thought of his mixing with their other friends, seeking indeed to convert into an enviable privilege, reserved for their intimates alone, the quarantine of the outsider, hopelessly uncouth, whom they are befriending. I felt on the contrary that Mme. de Guermantes was anxious for me to enjoy the most delightful society that she had to offer me when she went on, projecting as she spoke before my eyes as it were the violet-hued loveliness of a visit to Fabrice\u2019s aunt with the miracle of an introduction to Count Mosca:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOn Friday, now, couldn\u2019t you? There are just a few people coming; the Princesse de Parme, who is charming, not that I\u2019d ask you to meet anyone who wasn\u2019t nice.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Discarded in the intermediate social grades which are engaged in a perpetual upward movement, the family still plays an important part in certain stationary grades, such as the lower middle class and the semi-royal aristocracy, which latter cannot seek to raise itself since above it, from its own special point of view, there exists nothing higher. The friendship shewn me by her \u2018aunt Villeparisis\u2019 and Robert had perhaps made me, for Mme. de Guermantes and her friends, living always upon themselves and in the same little circle, the object of a curious interest of which I had no suspicion\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She had of those two relatives a familiar, everyday, homely knowledge, of a sort, utterly different from what we imagine, in which if we happen to be comprised in it, so far from our actions being at once ejected, like the grain of dust from the eye or the drop of water from the windpipe, they are capable of remaining engraved, and will still be related and discussed years after we ourselves have forgotten them, in the palace in which we are astonished to find them preserved, like a letter in our own handwriting among a priceless collection of autographs\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0People who are merely fashionable may set a guard upon doors which are too freely invalided. But the Guermantes door was not that. Hardly ever did a stranger have occasion to pass by it. If, for once in a way, the Duchess had one pointed out to her, she never dreamed of troubling herself about the social increment that he would bring, since this was a thing that she conferred and could not receive. She thought only of his real merits. Both Mme. de Villeparisis and Saint-Loup had testified to mine Doubtless she might not have believed them if she had not at the same time observed that they could never manage to secure me when they wanted me, and therefore that I attached no importance to worldly things, which seemed to the Duchess a sign that the stranger was to be numbered among what she called \u2018nice people.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was worth seeing, when one spoke to her of women for whom she did not care, how her face changed as soon as one named, in connexion with one of these, let us say, her sister-in-law. \u201cOh, she is charming!\u201d the Duchess would exclaim in a judicious, confident tone. The only reason that she gave was that this lady had declined to be introduced to the Marquise de Chaussegros and the Princesse de Silistrie. She did not add that the lady had declined also an introduction to herself, the Duchesse de Guermantes. This had, nevertheless, been the case, and ever since the mind of the Duchess had been at work trying to unravel the motives of a woman who was so hard to know, she was dying to be invited to call on her. People in society are so accustomed to be sought after that the person who shuns them seems to them a phoenix and at once monopolises their attention. Was the true motive in the mind of Mme. de Guermantes for thus inviting me (now that I was no longer in love with her) that I did not run after her relatives, although apparently run after myself by them? I cannot say. In any case, having made up her mind to invite me, she was anxious to do me the honours of the best company at her disposal and to keep away those of her friends whose presence might have dissuaded me from coming again, those whom she knew to be boring. I had not known to what to attribute her change of direction, when I had seen her deviate from her stellar path, come to sit down beside me and had heard her invite me to dinner, the effect of causes unknown for want of a special sense to enlighten us in this respect. We picture to ourselves the people who know us but slightly \u2014 such as, in my case, the Duchesse de Guermantes \u2014 as thinking of us only at the rare moments at which they set eyes on us. As a matter of fact this ideal oblivion in which we picture them as holding us is a purely arbitrary conception on our part. So that while, in our solitary silence, like that of a cloudless night, we imagine the various queens of society pursuing their course in the heavens at an infinite distance, we cannot help an involuntary start of dismay or pleasure if there falls upon us from that starry height, like a meteorite engraved with our name which we supposed to be unknown on Venus or Cassiopeia, an invitation to dinner or a piece of malicious gossip\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Perhaps now and then when, following the example of the Persian princes who, according to the Book of Esther, made their scribes read out to them the registers in which were enrolled the names of those of their subjects who had shewn zeal in their service, Mme. de Guermantes consulted her list of the well-disposed, she had said to herself, on coming to my name: \u201cA man we must ask to dine some day.\u201d But other thoughts had distracted her\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(Beset by surging cares, a Prince\u2019s mind\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Towards fresh matters ever is inclined)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0until the moment when she had caught sight of me sitting alone like Mordecai at the palace gate; and, the sight of me having refreshed her memory, sought, like Ahasuerus, to lavish her gifts upon me\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I must at the same time add that a surprise of a totally different sort was to follow that which I had felt on hearing Mme. de Guermantes ask me to dine with her. Since I had decided that it would shew greater modesty, on my part, and gratitude also not to conceal this initial surprise, but rather to exaggerate my expression of the delight that it gave me, Mme. de Guermantes, who was getting ready to go on to another, final party, had said to me, almost as a justification and for fear of my not being quite certain who she was, since I appeared so astonished at being invited to dine with her: \u201cYou know I\u2019m the aunt of Robert de Saint-Loup, who is such a friend of yours; besides we have met before.\u201d In replying that I was aware of this I added that I knew also M. de Charlus, \u201cwho had been very good to me at Balbec and in Paris.\u201d Mme. de Guermantes appeared dumbfoundered, and her eyes seemed to turn, as though for a verification of this statement, to some page, already filled and turned, of her internal register of events. \u201cWhat, so you know Palam\u00e8de, do you?\u201d This name assumed on the lips of Mme. de Guermantes a great charm, due to the instinctive simplicity with which she spoke of a man who was socially so brilliant a figure, but for her was no more than her brother-in-law and the cousin with whom she had grown up. And on the confused greyness which the life of the Duchesse de Guermantes was for me this name, Palam\u00e8de, shed as it were the radiance of long summer days on which she had played with him as a girl, at Guermantes, in the garden. Moreover, in this long outgrown period in their lives, Oriane de Guermantes and her cousin Palam\u00e8de had been very different from what they had since become; M. de Charlus in particular, entirely absorbed in the artistic pursuits from which he had so effectively restrained himself in later life that I was stupefied to learn that it was he who had painted the huge fan with black and yellow irises which the Duchess was at this moment unfurling. She could also have shewn me a little sonatina which he had once composed for her. I was completely unaware that the Baron possessed all these talents, of which he never spoke. Let me remark in passing that M. de Charlus did not at all relish being called \u2018Palam\u00e8de\u2019 by his family. That the form \u2018M\u00e9m\u00e9\u2019 might not please him one could easily understand. These stupid abbreviations are a sign of the utter inability of the aristocracy to appreciate its own Poetic beauty (in Jewry, too, we may see the same defect, since a nephew of Lady Israels, whose name was Moses, was commonly known as \u2018Momo\u2019) concurrently with its anxiety not to appear to attach any importance to what is aristocratic. Now M. de Charlus had, in this connexion, a greater wealth of poetic imagination and a more blatant pride. But the reason for his distaste for \u2018M\u00e9m\u00e9\u2019 could not be this, since it extended also to the fine name Palam\u00e8de. The truth was that, considering, knowing himself to come of a princely stock, he would have liked his brother and sister-in-law to refer to him as \u2018Charlus,\u2019 just as Queen Marie-Am\u00e9lie and Duc d\u2019Orl\u00e9ans might have spoken of their sons and grandsons, brothers and nephews as \u2018Joinville, Nemours, Chartres, Paris.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat a humbug M\u00e9m\u00e9 is!\u201d she exclaimed. \u201cWe talked to him about you for hours; he told us that he would be delighted to make your acquaintance, just as if he had never set eyes on you. You must admit he\u2019s odd, and \u2014 though it\u2019s not very nice of me to say such a thing about a brother-in-law I\u2019m devoted to, and really do admire immensely \u2014 a trifle mad at times.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I was struck by the application of this last epithet to M. de Charlus, and said to myself that this half-madness might perhaps account for certain things, such as his having appeared so delighted by his own proposal that I should ask Bloch to castigate his mother. I decided that, by reason not only of the things he said but of the way in which he said them, M. de Charlus must be a little mad. The first time that one listens to a barrister or an actor, one is surprised by his tone, so different from the conversational. But, observing that everyone else seems to find this quite natural, one says nothing about it to other people, one says nothing in fact to oneself, one is content with appreciating the degree of talent shewn. At the most, one may think, of an actor at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Fran\u00e7ais: \u201cWhy, instead of letting his raised arm fall naturally, did he make it drop in a series of little jerks broken by pauses for at least ten minutes?\u201d or of a Labori: \u201cWhy, whenever he opened his mouth, did he utter those tragic, unexpected sounds to express the simplest things?\u201d But as everybody admits these actions to be necessary and obvious one is not shocked by them. So, upon thinking it over, one said to oneself that M. de Charlus spoke of himself with undue emphasis in a tone which was not in the least that of ordinary speech. It seemed as though one might have at any moment interrupted him with: \u201cBut why do you shout so? Why are you so offensive?\u201d only everyone seemed to have tacitly agreed that it was all right. And one took one\u2019s place in the circle which applauded his outbursts. But certainly, at certain moments, a stranger might have thought that he was listening to the ravings of a maniac\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut are you sure you\u2019re not thinking of some one else? Do you really mean my brother-in-law Palam\u00e8de?\u201d went on the Duchess, a trace of impertinence grafted upon her natural simplicity\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I replied that I was absolutely sure, and that M. de Charlus must have failed to catch my name\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh well! I shall leave you now,\u201d said Mme. de Guermantes, as though she regretted the parting. \u201cI must look in for a moment at the Princesse de Ligne\u2019s. You aren\u2019t going on there? No? You don\u2019t care for parties? You\u2019re very wise, they are too boring for words. If only I hadn\u2019t got to go. But she\u2019s my cousin; it wouldn\u2019t be polite. I am sorry, selfishly, for my own sake, because I could have taken you there, and brought you back afterwards, too. So I shall say good-bye now, and look forward to Friday.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That M. de Charlus should have blushed to be seen with me by M. d\u2019Argencourt was all very well. But that to his own sister-in-law, who had so high an opinion of him besides, he should deny all knowledge of me, knowledge which was perfectly natural seeing that I was a friend of both his aunt and his nephew, was a thing that I could not understand\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I shall end my account of this incident with the remark that from one point of view there was in Mme. de Guermantes a true greatness which consisted in her entirely obliterating from her memory what other people would have only partially forgotten. Had she never seen me waylaying her, following her, tracking her down as she took her morning walks, had she never responded to my daily salute with an angry impatience, had she never refused Saint-Loup when he begged her to invite me to her house, she could not have greeted me now in a nobler or more gracious manner. Not only did she waste no time in retrospective explanations, in hints, allusions or ambiguous smiles, not only was there in her present affability, without any harking back to the past, without any reticence, something as proudly rectilinear as her majestic stature, but the resentment which she might have felt against anyone in the past was so entirely reduced to ashes, the ashes were themselves cast so utterly from her memory, or at least from her manner, that on studying her face whenever she had occasion to treat with the most exquisite simplification what in so many other people would have been a pretext for reviving stale antipathies and recriminations one had the impression of an intense purity of mind\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But if I was surprised by the modification that had occurred in her opinion of me, how much more did it surprise me to find a similar but ever so much greater change in my feeling for her. Had there not been a time during which I could regain life and strength only if \u2014 always building new castles in the air! \u2014 I had found some one who would obtain for me an invitation to her house and, after this initial boon, would procure many others for my increasingly exacting heart? It was the impossibility of finding any avenue there that had made me leave Paris for Donci\u00e8res to visit Robert de Saint-Loup. And now it was indeed by the consequence of a letter from him that I was agitated, but on account this time of Mme. de Stermaria, not of Mme. de Guermantes\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Let me add further, to conclude my account of this party, that there Occurred at it an incident, contradicted a few days later, which continued to puzzle me, interrupted for some time my friendship with Bloch, and constitutes in itself one of those curious paradoxes the explanation of which will be found in the next part of this work. At this party at Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s, Bloch kept on boasting to me about the friendly attentions shewn him by M. de Charlus, who, when he passed him in the street, looked him straight in the face as though he recognised him, was anxious to know him personally, knew quite well who he was. I smiled at first, Bloch having expressed so vehemently at Balbec his contempt for the said M. de Charlus. And I supposed merely that Bloch, like his father in the Case of Bergotte, knew the Baron \u2018without actually knowing him,\u2019 and that what he took for a friendly glance was due to absent-mindedness. But finally Bloch became so precise and appeared so confident that on two or three occasions M. de Charlus had wished to address him that, remembering that I had spoken of my friend to the Baron, who had, as we walked away together from this very house, as it happened, asked me various questions about him, I came to the conclusion that Bloch was not lying that M. de Charlus had heard his name, realised that he was my friend\u2019 and so forth. And so, a little later, at the theatre one evening, I asked M! de Charlus if I might introduce Bloch to him, and, on his assenting, went in search of my friend. But as soon as M. de Charlus caught sight of him an expression of astonishment, instantly repressed, appeared on his face where it gave way to a blazing fury. Not only did he not offer Bloch his hand but whenever Bloch spoke to him he replied in the most insolent manner, in an angry and wounding tone. So that Bloch, who, according to his version, had received nothing until then from the Baron but smiles, assumed that I had not indeed commended but disparaged him in the short speech in which, knowing M. de Charlus\u2019s liking for formal procedure, I had told him about my friend before bringing him up to be introduced. Bloch left us, his spirit broken, like a man who has been trying to mount a horse which is always ready to take the bit in its teeth, or to swim against waves which continually dash him back on the shingle, and did not speak to me again for six months\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The days that preceded my dinner with Mme. de Stermaria were for me by no means delightful, in fact it was all I could do to live through them. For as a general rule, the shorter the interval is that separates us from our planned objective, the longer it seems to us, because we apply to it a more minute scale of measurement, or simply because it occurs to us to measure it at all. The Papacy, we are told, reckons by centuries, and indeed may not think perhaps of reckoning time at all, since its goal is in eternity. Mine was no more than three days off; I counted by seconds, I gave myself up to those imaginings which are the first movements of caresses, of caresses which it maddens us not to be able to make the woman herself reciprocate and complete \u2014 those identical caresses, to the exclusion of all others. And, as a matter of fact, it is true that, generally speaking, the difficulty of attaining to the object of a desire enhances that desire (the difficulty, not the impossibility, for that suppresses it altogether), yet in the case of a desire that is wholly physical the certainty that it will be realised, at a fixed and not distant point in time, is scarcely less exciting than uncertainty; almost as much as an anxious doubt, the absence of doubt makes intolerable the period of waiting for the pleasure that is bound to come, because it makes of that suspense an innumerably rehearsed accomplishment and by the frequency of our proleptic representations divides time into sections as minute as could be carved by agony. What I required was to possess Mme. de Stermaria, for during the last few days, with an incessant activity, my desires had been preparing this pleasure, in my imagination, and this pleasure alone, for any other kind (pleasure, that is, taken with another woman) would not have been ready, pleasure being but the realisation of a previous wish, and of one which is not always the same, but changes according to the endless combinations of one\u2019s fancies, the accidents of one\u2019s memory, the state of one\u2019s temperament, the variability of one\u2019s desires, the most recently granted of which lie dormant until the disappointment of their satisfaction has been to some extent forgotten; I should not have been prepared, I had already turned from the main road of general desires and had ventured along the bridle-path of a particular desire; I should have had \u2014 in order to wish for a different assignation \u2014 to retrace my steps too far before rejoining the main road and taking another path. To take possession of Mme. de Stermaria on the island in the Bois de Boulogne where I had asked her to dine with me, this was the pleasure that I imagined to myself afresh every moment. It would have automatically perished if I had dined on that island without Mme. de Stermaria; but perhaps as greatly diminished had I dined, even with her, somewhere else. Besides, the attitudes in which one pictures a pleasure to oneself exist previously to the woman, to the type of woman required to give one that pleasure. They dictate the pleasure, and the place as well, and on that account bring to the fore alternatively, in our capricious fancy, this or that woman, this or that scene, this or that room, which in other weeks we should have dismissed with contempt. Child of the attitude that produced her, one woman will not appeal to us without the large bed in which we find peace by her side, while others, to be caressed with a more secret intention, require leaves blown by the wind, water rippling in the night, are as frail and fleeting as they\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0No doubt in the past, long before I received Saint-Loup\u2019s letter and when there was as yet no question of Mme. de Stermaria, the island in the Bois had seemed to me to be specially designed for pleasure, because I had found myself going there to taste the bitterness of having no pleasure to enjoy in its shelter. It is to the shores of the lake from which one goes to that island, and along which, in the last weeks of summer, those ladies of Paris who have not yet left for the country take the air, that, not knowing where to look for her, or if indeed she has not already left Paris, one wanders in the hope of seeing the girl go by with whom one fell in love at the last ball of the season, whom one will not have a chance of meeting again in any drawing-room until the following spring. Feeling it to be at least the eve, if not the morrow, of the beloved\u2019s departure, one follows along the brink of the shivering water those attractive paths by which already a first red leaf is blooming like a last rose, one scans that horizon where, by a device the opposite of that employed in those panoramas beneath whose domed roofs the wax figures in the foreground impart to the painted canvas beyond them the illusory appearance of depth and mass, our eyes, passing without any transition from the cultivated park to the natural heights of Meudon and the Mont Val\u00e9rien, do not know where to set the boundary, and make the natural country trespass upon the handiwork of the gardener, of which they project far beyond its own limits the artificial charm; like those rare birds reared in the open in a botanical garden which every day in the liberty of their winged excursions sally forth to strike, among the surrounding woods, an exotic note. Between the last festivity of summer and one\u2019s winter exile, one ranges anxiously that romantic world of chance encounters and lover\u2019s melancholy, and one would be no more surprised to learn that it was situated outside the mapped universe than if, at Versailles, looking down from the terrace, an observatory round which the clouds are massed against a blue sky in the manner of Van der Meulen, after having thus risen above the bounds of nature, one were informed that, there where nature begins again at the end of the great canal, the villages which one just could not make out, on a horizon as dazzling as the sea, were called Fleurus or Nim\u00e8gue\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And then, the last carriage having rolled by, when one feels with a throb of pain that she will not come now, one goes to dine on the island; above the shivering poplars which suggest endless mysteries of evening though without response, a pink cloud paints a last touch of life in the tranquil sky. A few drops of rain fall without noise on the water, ancient but still in its diyine infancy coloured always by the weather and continually forgetting the reflexions of clouds and flowers. And after the geraniums have vainly striven, by intensifying the brilliance of their scarlet, to resist the gathering darkness, a mist rises to envelop the now slumbering island; one walks in the moist dimness along the water\u2019s edge, where at the most the silent passage of a swan startles one like, in a bed, at night, the eyes, for a moment wide open, and the swift smile of a child whom one did not suppose to be awake. Then one would like to have with one a loving companion, all the more as one feels oneself to be alone and can imagine oneself to be far away from the world\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But to this island, where even in summer there was often a mist, how much more gladly would I have brought Mme. de Stermaria now that the cold season, the back end of autumn had come. If the weather that had prevailed since Sunday had not by itself rendered grey and maritime the scenes in which my imagination was living \u2014 as other seasons made them balmy, luminous, Italian \u2014 the hope of, in a few days\u2019 time, making Mme. de Stermaria mine would have been quite enough to raise, twenty times in an hour, a curtain of mist in my monotonously lovesick imagination. In any event the mist, which since yesterday had risen even in Paris, not only made me think incessantly of the native place of the young woman whom I had invited to dine with me, but, since it was probable that, far more thickly than in the streets of the town, it must after sunset be invading the Bois, especially the shores of the lake, I thought that it would make the Swans\u2019 Island, for me, something like that Breton island the marine and misty atmosphere of which had always enwrapped in my mind like a garment the pale outline of Mme. de Stermaria. Of course when we are young, at the age I had reached at the period of my walks along the M\u00e9s\u00e9glise way, our desires, our faith bestow on a woman\u2019s clothing an individual personality, an ultimate quintessence. We pursue reality. But by dint of allowing it to escape we end by noticing that, after all those vain endeavours which have led to nothing, something solid subsists, which is what we have been seeking. We begin to separate, to recognise what we love, we try to procure it for ourselves, be it only by a stratagem. Then, in the absence of our vanished faith, costume fills the gap, by means of a deliberate illusion. I knew quite well that within half an hour of home I should not find myself in Brittany. But in walking arm in arm with Mme. de Stermaria in the dusk of the island, by the water\u2019s edge, I should be acting like other men who, unable to penetrate the walls of \u00e0 convent, do at least, before enjoying a woman, clothe her in the habit of a nun\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I could even look forward to hearing, as I sat with the lady, the lapping of waves, for, on the day before our dinner, a storm broke over Paris. I was beginning to shave myself before going to the island to engage the room (albeit at this time of year the island was empty and the restaurant deserted) and order the food for our dinner next day when Fran\u00e7oise came in to tell me that Albertine had called. I made her come in at once, indifferent to her finding me disfigured by a bristling chin, her for whom at Balbec I had never felt smart enough and who had cost me then as much agitation and distress as Mme. de Stermaria was costing me now. The latter, I was determined, must go away with the best possible impression from our evening together. Accordingly I asked Albertine to come with me there and then to the island to order the food. She to whom one gives everything is so quickly replaced by another that one is surprised to find oneself giving all that one has, afresh, at every moment, without any hope of future reward. At my suggestion the smiling rosy face beneath Albertine\u2019s flat cap, which came down very low, to her eyebrows, seemed to hesitate. She had probably other plans; if so she sacrificed them willingly, to my great satisfaction, for I attached the utmost importance to my having with me a young housewife who would know a great deal more than myself about ordering dinner\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is quite true that she had represented something utterly different for me at Balbec. But our intimacy, even when we do not consider it close enough at the time, with a woman with whom we are in love creates between her and us, in spite of the shortcomings that pain us while our love lasts, social ties which outlast our love and even the memory of our love. Then, in her who is nothing more for us than a means of approach, an avenue towards others, we are just as astonished and amused to learn from our memory what her name meant originally to that other creature which we then were as if, after giving a cabman an address in the Boulevard des Capucines or the Rue du Bac, thinking only of the person whom we are going to see there, we remind ourself that the names were once those of, respectively, the Capuchin nuns whose convent stood on the site and the ferry across the Seine\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At the same time, my Balbec desires had so generously ripened Albertine\u2019s body, had gathered and stored in it savours so fresh and sweet that, as we drove through the Bois, while the wind like a careful gardener shook the trees, brought down the fruit, swept up the fallen leaves, I said to myself that had there been any risk of Saint-Loup\u2019s being mistaken, or of my having misunderstood his letter, so that my dinner with Mme. de Stermaria might lead to no satisfactory result, I should have made an appointment for the same evening, later on, with Albertine, so as to forget, for a purely voluptuous hour, as I held in my arms a body of which my curiosity had long since computed, weighed up all the possible charms in which now it abounded, the emotions and perhaps the regrets of this first phase of love for Mme. de Stermaria. And certainly if I could have supposed that Mme de Stermaria would not grant me any of her favours at our first meeting, I should have formed a slightly depressing picture of my evening with her. I knew too well from experience how the two stages which occur in us in the first phase of our love for a woman whom we have desired without knowing her, loving in her rather the particular kind of existence in which she is steeped than her still unfamiliar self \u2014 how distorted is the reflexion of those two stages in the world of facts, that is to say not in ourselves any longer but in our meetings with her. We have, without ever having talked to her, hesitated, tempted as we were by the poetic charm which she represented for us. Shall it be this woman or another? And lo, our dreams become fixed round about her, cease to have any separate existence from her. The first meeting with her which will shortly follow should reflect this dawning love. Nothing of the sort. As if it were necessary that our material life should have its first period also, in love with her already, we talk to her in the most trivial fashion: \u201cI asked you to dine on this island because I thought the surroundings would amuse you. I\u2019ve nothing particular to say to you, don\u2019t you know. But it\u2019s rather damp, I\u2019m afraid, and you may find it cold \u2014\u201d \u201cOh, no, not at all!\u201d \u201cYou just say that out of politeness. Very well, Madame, I shall allow you to battle against the cold for another quarter of an hour, as I don\u2019t want to bother you, but in fifteen minutes I shall carry you off by force. I don\u2019t want to have you catching a chill.\u201d And without another word said we take her home, remembering nothing about her, at the most a certain look in her eyes, but thinking only of seeing her again. Well, at our second meeting (when we do not find even that look, our sole memory of her, but nevertheless have been thinking only of seeing her again), the first stage is passed. Nothing has happened in the interval. And yet, instead of talking about the comfort or want of comfort of the restaurant, we say, without our words appearing to surprise the new person, who seems to us positively plain but to whom we should like to think that people were talking about us at every moment in her life: \u201cWe are going to have our work cut out to overcome all the obstacles in our way. Do you think we shall be successful? Do you suppose that we can triumph over our enemies \u2014 live happily ever afterwards, and all that sort of thing?\u201d But these conversational openings, trivial to begin with, then hinting at love, would not be required; I could trust Saint-Loup\u2019s letter for that. Mme. de Stermaria would yield herself to me from the first, I should have no need therefore to engage Albertine to come to me, as a makeshift, later in the evening. It would be superfluous; Robert never exaggerated, and his letter was explicit\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Albertine spoke hardly at all, conscious that my thoughts were elsewhere. We went a little way on foot into the greenish, almost submarine grotto of a dense mass of trees, on the domed tops of which we heard the wind sweep and the rain pelt. I trod underfoot dead leaves which, like shells, were trampled into the soil, and poked with my stick at fallen chestnuts prickly as sea-urchins\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the boughs the last clinging leaves, shaken by the wind, followed it only as far as their stems would allow, but sometimes these broke, and they fell to the ground, along which they coursed to overtake it. I thought with joy how much more remote still, if this weather lasted, the island would be on the morrow \u2014 and in any case quite deserted. We returned to our carriage and, as the storm had passed off, Albertine asked me to take her on to Saint-Cloud. As on the ground the drifting leaves so up above the clouds were chasing the wind. And a stream of migrant evenings, of which a sort of conic section cut through the sky made visible the successive layers, pink, blue and green, were gathered in readiness for departure to warmer climes. To obtain a closer view of a marble goddess who had been carved in the act of leaping from her pedestal and, alone in a great wood which seemed to be consecrated to her, filled it with the mythological terror, half animal, half divine, of her frenzied bounding, Albertine climbed a grassy slope while I waited for her in the road. She herself, seen thus from below, no longer coarse and plump as, a few days earlier, on my bed when the grain of her throat became apparent in the lens of my eye as it approached her person, but chiselled and delicate, seemed a little statue on which our happy hours together at Balbec had left their patina. When I found myself alone again at home, and remembered that I had taken a drive that afternoon with Albertine, that I was to dine in two days\u2019 time with Mme. de Guermantes and that I had to answer a letter from Gilberte, three women each of whom I had once loved, I said to myself that our social existence is, like an artist\u2019s studio, filled with abandoned sketches in which we have fancied for a moment that we could set down in permanent form our need of a great love, but it did not occur to me that sometimes, if the sketch be not too old, it may happen that we return to it and make of it a work wholly different, and possibly more important than what we had originally planned\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The next day was cold and fine; winter was in the air \u2014 indeed the season was so far advanced that it had seemed miraculous that we should find in the already pillaged Bois a few domes of gilded green. When I awoke I saw, as from the window of the barracks at Donci\u00e8res, a uniform, dead white mist which hung gaily in the sunlight, consistent and sweet as a web of spun sugar. Then the sun withdrew, and the mist thickened still further in the afternoon. Night fell early, I made ready for dinner, but it was still too soon to start; I decided to send a carriage for Mme. de Stermaria. I did not like to go for her in it myself, not wishing to force my company on her, but I gave the driver a note for her in which I asked whether she would mind my coming to call for her. While I waited for her answer I lay down on my bed, shut my eyes for a moment, then opened them again. Over the top of the curtains there was nothing now but a thin strip of daylight which grew steadily fainter. I recognised that wasted hour, the large ante-room of pleasure, the dark, delicious emptiness of which I had learned at Balbec to know and to enjoy when, alone in my room as I was now, while all the rest were at dinner, I saw without regret the daylight fade from above my curtains, knowing that, presently, after a night of arctic brevity, it was to be resuscitated in a more dazzling brightness in the lighted rooms of Rivebelle. I sprang from my bed, tied my black necktie, passed a brush over my hair, final gestures of a belated tidying carried out at Balbec with my mind not on myself but on the women whom I should see at Rivebelle while I smiled at them in anticipation in the mirror that stood across a corner of my room, gestures which, on that account, had continued to herald a form of entertainment in which music and lights would be mingled. Like magic signs they summoned, nay rather presented this entertainment already; thanks to them I had, of its intoxicating frivolous charm as complete an enjoyment as I had had at Combray, in the month of July, when I heard the hammer-blows ring on the packing cases and enjoyed, in the coolness of my darkened room, a sense of warmth and sunshine\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Also, it was no longer exactly Mme. de Stermaria that I should have wished most to see. Forced now to spend my evening with her, I should have preferred, as it was almost the last before the return of my parents that it should remain free and myself try instead to find some of the women from Rivebelle. I gave my hands one more final wash and, my sense of pleasure keeping me on the move, dried them as I walked through the shuttered dining-room. It appeared to have a door open on to the lighted hall but what I had taken for the bright chink of the door, which as a matter of fact was closed, was only the gleaming reflexion of my towel in a mirror that had been laid against the wall in readiness to be fixed in its place before Mamma\u2019s return. I thought of all the other illusions of the sort which I had discovered in different parts of the house, and which were not optical only, for when we first came there I had supposed that our next-door neighbour kept a dog on account of the continuous, almost human yapping which came from a certain pipe in the kitchen whenever the tap was turned on. And the door on to the outer landing never closed by itself, very gently, caught by a draught on the staircase, without rendering those broken, voluptuous, whimpering passages which sound over the chant of the pilgrims towards the end of Overture to Tannh\u00e4user. I had, moreover, just as I had put my towel back on its rail, an opportunity of hearing a fresh rendering of this brilliant symphonic fragment, for at a peal of the bell I hurried out to open the door to the driver who had come with Mme. de Stermaria\u2019s answer. I thought that his message would be: \u201cThe lady is downstairs,\u201d or \u201cThe lady is waiting.\u201d But he had a letter in his hand. I hesitated for a moment before looking to see what Mme. de Stermaria had written, who, while she held the pen in her hand, might have been anything but was now, detached from herself, an engine of fate, pursuing a course alone, which she was utterly powerless to alter. I asked the driver to wait downstairs for a moment, although he was cursing the fog. As soon as he had gone I opened the envelope. On her card, inscribed Vicomtesse Alix de. Stermaria, my guest had written: \u201cAm so sorry \u2014 am unfortunately prevented from dining with you this evening on the island in the Bois. Had been so looking forward to it. Will write you a proper letter from Stermaria. Very sorry. Kindest regards.\u201d I stood motionless, stunned by the shock that I had received. At my feet lay the card and envelope, fallen like the spent cartridge from a gun when the shot has been fired. I picked them up, tried to analyse her message. \u201cShe says that she cannot dine with me on the island in the Bois. One might gather from that that she would dine with me somewhere else. I shall not be so indiscreet as to go and fetch her, but, after all, that is quite a reasonable interpretation.\u201d And from that island in the Bois, as for the last few days my thoughts had been installed there beforehand with Mme. de Sterm\u00e2ria, I could not succeed in bringing them back to where I was. My desire responded automatically to the gravitational force which had been pulling it now for so many hours on end, and in spite of this message, too recent to counteract that force, I went on instinctively getting ready to start, just as a student, although ploughed by the examiners, tries to answer one question more. At last I decided to tell Fran\u00e7oise to go down and pay the driver. I went along the passage without finding her, I passed through the dining-room, where suddenly my feet ceased to sound on the bare boards as they had been doing and were hushed to a silence which, even before I had realised the explanation of it, gave me a feeling of suffocation and confinement. It was the carpets which, in view of my parents\u2019 return, the servants had begun to put down again, those carpets which look so well on bright mornings when amid their disorder the sun stays and waits for you like a friend come to take you out to luncheon in the country, and casts over them the dappled light and shade of the forest, but which now on the contrary were the first installation of the wintry prison from which, obliged as I should be to live, to take my meals at home, I should no longer be free now to escape when I chose\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cTake care you don\u2019t slip, Sir; they\u2019re not tacked yet,\u201d Fran\u00e7oise called to me. \u201cI ought to have lighted up. Oh, dear, it\u2019s the end of \u2018Sectember\u2019 already, the fine days are over.\u201d In no time, winter; at the corner of a window, as in a Galle glass, a vein of crusted snow; and even in the Champs-Elys\u00e9es, instead of the girls one waits to see, nothing but solitary sparrows\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What added to my distress at not seeing Mme. de Sterm\u00e2ria was that her answer led me to suppose that whereas, hour by hour, since Sunday, I had been living for this dinner alone, she had presumably never given it a second thought. Later on I learned of an absurd love match that she had suddenly made with a young man whom she must already have been seeing at this time, and who had presumably made her forget my invitation. For if she had remembered it she would surely never have waited for the carriage which I was not, for that matter, supposed to be sending for her, to inform me that she was otherwise engaged. My dreams of a young feudal maiden on a misty island had cleared the way to a still non-existent love. Now my disappointment, my rage, my desperate desire to recapture her who had just refused me were able, by bringing my sensibility into play, to make definite the possible love which until then my imagination alone had \u2014 and that more loosely \u2014 offered me\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0How many are there in our memories, how many more have we forgotten, of these faces of girls and young women, all different, to which we have added a certain charm and a frenzied desire to see them again only because at the last moment they eluded us? In the case of Mme. de Stermaria there was a good deal more than this, and it was enough now to make me love her for me to see her again so that I might refresh those impressions, so vivid but all too brief, which my memory would not, without such refreshment, have the strength to keep alive when we were apart. Circumstances decided against me; I did not see her again. It was not she that I loved, but it might well have been. And one of the things that made most cruel, perhaps, the great love which was presently to come to me was that when I thought of this evening I used to say to myself that my love might, given a slight modification of very ordinary circumstances, have been directed elsewhere, to Mme. de Stermaria; its application to her who inspired it in me so soon afterwards was not therefore \u2014 as I so longed so needed to believe \u2014 absolutely necessary and predestined\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fran\u00e7oise had left me by myself in the dining-room with the remark that it was foolish of me to stay there before she had lighted the fire. She went to get me some dinner, for even before the return of my parents, from this very evening, my seclusion was to begin. I caught sight of a huge bundle of carpets, still rolled up, and leaning against one end of the sideboard, and burying my head in it, swallowing its dust with my own tears, as the Jews used to cover their heads with ashes in times of mourning, I began to sob. I shuddered not only because the room was cold, but because a distinct lowering of temperature (against the danger and \u2014 I should add, perhaps \u2014 the by no means disagreeable sensation of which we make no attempt to react) is brought about by a certain kind of tears which fall from our eyes, drop by drop, like a fine, penetrating, icy rain, and seem as though never would they cease to flow. Suddenly I heard a voice:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMay I come in? Fran\u00e7oise told me you would be in the dining-room. I looked in to see whether you would care to come out and dine somewhere, if it isn\u2019t bad for your throat \u2014 there\u2019s a fog outside you could cut with a knife.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was \u2014 arrived in Paris that morning, when I imagined him to be still in Morocco or on the sea \u2014 Robert de Saint-Loup\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I have already said (as a matter of fact, it was Robert himself who, at Balbec, had helped me, quite without meaning it, to arrive at this conclusion) what I think about friendship: to wit that it is so small a thing that I find it hard to understand how men with some claim to genius \u2014 Nietzsche, for instance \u2014 can have been such simpletons as to ascribe to it a certain intellectual value, and consequently to deny themselves friendships in which intellectual esteem would have no part. Yes, it has always been a surprise to me to find a man who carried sincerity towards himself to so high a pitch as to cut himself off, by a scruple of conscience, from Wagner\u2019s music, imagining that the truth could ever be attained by the mode of expression, naturally vague and inadequate, which our actions in general and acts of friendship in particular furnish, or that there could be any kind of significance in the fact of one\u2019s leaving one\u2019s work to go and see a friend and shed tears with him on hearing the false report that the Louvre was burned. I had got so far, at Balbec, as to find that the pleasure of playing with a troop of girls is less destructive of the spiritual life, to which at least it remains alien, than friendship, the whole effort of which is directed towards making us sacrifice the one real and (save by the channel of art) incommunicable part of ourself to a superficial self which finds \u2014 not, like the other, any joy in itself, but rather a vague, sentimental attraction in the feeling that it is being supported by external props, hospitably entertained by a strange personality, through which, happy in the protection that is afforded it there, it makes its own comfort radiate in warm approval, and marvels at qualities which it would denounce as faults and seek to correct in itself. Moreover the scorners of friendship can, without illusion and not without remorse, be the finest friends in the world, just as an artist carrying in his brain a masterpiece and feeling that his duty is rather to live and carry on his work, nevertheless, so as not to be thought or to run the risk of actually being selfish, gives his life for a vain cause, and gives it all the more gallantly in that the reasons for which he would have preferred not to give it were disinterested. But whatever might be my opinion of friendship, to mention only the pleasure that it procured me, of a quality so mediocre as to be like something halfway between physical exhaustion and mental boredom, there is no brew so deadly that it cannot at certain moments, become precious and invigorating by giving us just the stimulus that was necessary, the warmth that we cannot generate in ourselves\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The thought of course never entered my mind now of asking Saint-Loup to take me (as, an hour earlier, I had been longing to go) to see some of the Rivebelle women; the scar left by my disappointment with Mme. de Stermaria was too recent still to be so easily healed, but at the moment when I had ceased to feel in my heart any reason for happiness Saint-Loup\u2019s bursting in upon me was like a sudden apparition of kindness, mirth, life, which were external to me, no doubt, but offered themselves to me, asked only to be made mine. He did not himself understand my shout of gratitude, my tears of affection. And yet is there anything more unaccountably affecting than one of those friends, be he diplomat, explorer, airman or soldier like Saint-Loup, who, having to start next day for the country, from where they will go on heaven knows where, seem to form for themselves, in the evening which they devote to us, an impression which we are astonished both to find, so rare and fleeting is it, can be so pleasant to them, and, since it does so delight them, not to see them prolong farther or repeat more often. A meal with us, an event so natural in itself, affords these travellers the same strange and exquisite pleasure as our boulevards give to an Asiatic. We set off together to dine, and as I went downstairs I thought of Donci\u00e8res where every evening I used to meet Robert at his restaurant, and the little dining-rooms there that I had forgotten. I remembered one of these to which I had never given a thought, and which was not in the hotel where Saint-Loup dined but in another, far humbler, a cross between an inn and a boarding-house, where the waiting was done by the landlady and one of her servants. I had been forced to take shelter there once from a snowstorm. Besides, Robert was not to be dining at the hotel that evening and I had not cared to go any farther. My food was brought to me, upstairs, in a little room with bare wooden walls. The lamp went out during dinner and the servant lighted a couple of candles. I, pretending that I could not see very well as I held out my plate, while she helped me to potatoes, took her bare fore-arm in my hand, as though to guide her. Seeing that she did not withdraw it, I began to fondle it, then, without saying a word, pulled her bodily to me, blew out the candles and told her to feel in my pocket for some money. For the next few days physical pleasure seemed to me to require, to be properly enjoyed, not only this servant but the timbered dining-room, so remote and lonely. And yet it was to the other, in which Saint-Loup and his friends dined, that I returned every evening, from force of habit and in friendship for them, until I left Donci\u00e8res. But even of this hotel, where he took his meals with his friends, I had long ceased to think; we make little use of our experience, we leave unconsumed in the summer dusk or precocious nights of winter the hours in which it had seemed to us that there might nevertheless be contained some element of tranquillity or pleasure. But those hours are not altogether wasted. When, in their turn, come and sing to us fresh moments of pleasure, which by themselves would pass by equally bare in outline, the others recur, bringing with them the groundwork, the solid consistency of a rich orchestration. They are in this way prolonged into one of those types of happiness which we recapture only now and again but which continue to exist; in the present instance the type was that of forsaking everything else to dine in comfortable surroundings, which by the help of memory embody in a scene from nature suggestions of the rewards of travel, with a friend who is going to stir our dormant life with all his energy, his affection, to communicate to us an emotional pleasure, very different from anything that we could derive from our own efforts or from social distractions; we are going to exist solely for him, to utter vows of friendship which, born within the confines of the hour, remaining imprisoned in it, will perhaps not be kept on the morrow but which I need have no scruple in taking before Saint-Loup since, with a courage into which there entered a great deal of common sense and the presentiment that friendship cannot explore its own depths, on the morrow he would be gone\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If as I came downstairs I lived over again the evenings at Donci\u00e8res, when we reached the street, in a moment the darkness, now almost total, in which the fog seemed to have put out the lamps, which one could make out, glimmering very faintly, only when close at hand, took me back to I could not say what arrival, by night, at Combray, when the streets there were still lighted only at long intervals and one felt one\u2019s way through a darkness moist, warm, consecrated, like that of a Christmas manger, just visibly starred here and there by a wick that burned no brighter than a candle. Between that year \u2014 to which I could ascribe no precise date \u2014 of my Combray life and the evenings at Rivebelle which had, an hour earlier, been reflected above my drawn curtains, what a world of differences! I felt on perceiving them an enthusiasm which might have borne fruit had I been left alone and would then have saved me the unnecessary round of many wasted years through which I was yet to pass before there was revealed to me that invisible vocation of which these volumes are the history. Had the revelation come to me this evening, the carriage in which I sat would have deserved to rank as more memorable with me than Dr. Percepied\u2019s, on the box seat of which I had composed that little sketch \u2014 on which, as it happened, I had recently laid my hands, altered it and sent it in vain to theFigaro \u2014 of the spires of Martinville. Is it because we live over our past years not in their continuous sequence, day by day, but in a memory that fastens upon the coolness or sun-parched heat of some morning or afternoon, receives the shadow of some solitary place, is enclosed, immovable, arrested, lost, remote from all others, because, therefore, the changes gradually wrought not only in the world outside but in our dreams and our evolving character (changes which have imperceptibly carried us through life from one to another, wholly different time), are of necessity eliminated, that, if we revive another memory taken from a different year, we find between the two, thanks to lacunae, to vast stretches of oblivion, as it were the gulf of a difference in altitude or the incompatibility of two divers qualities, that of the air we breathe and the colour of the scene before our eyes? But between one and another of the memories that had now come to me in turn of Combray, of Donci\u00e8res and of Rivebelle, I was conscious at the moment of more than a distance in time, of the distance that there would be between two separate universes the material elements in which were not the same. If I had sought to reproduce the element in which appeared carven my most trivial memories of Rivebelle, I should have had to streak with rosy veins, to render at once translucent, compact, refreshing, resonant a substance hitherto analogous to the coarse dark sandstone walls of Combray. But Robert having finished giving his instructions to the driver joined me now in the carriage. The ideas that had appeared before me took flight. Ideas are goddesses who deign at times to make themselves visible to a solitary mortal, at a turning in the road, even in his bedroom while he sleeps, when they, standing framed in the doorway, bring him the annunciation of their tidings. But as soon as a companion joins him they vanish, in the society of his fellows no man has ever beheld them. And I found myself cast back upon friendship. When he first appeared Robert had indeed warned me that there was a good deal of fog outside, but while we were indoors, talking, it had grown steadily thicker. It was no longer merely the light mist which I had looked forward to seeing rise from the island and envelop Mme. de Stermaria and myself. A few feet away from us the street lamps were blotted out and then it was night, as dark as in the open fields, in a forest, or rather on a mild Breton island whither I would fain have gone; I lost myself, as on the stark coast of some. Northern sea where one risks one\u2019s life twenty times over before coming to the solitary inn; ceasing to be a mirage for which one seeks, the fog became one of those dangers against which one has to fight, so that we had, in finding our way and reaching a safe haven, the difficulties, the anxiety and finally the joy which safety, so little perceived by him who is not threatened with the loss of it, gives to the perplexed and benighted traveller. One thing only came near to destroying my pleasure during our adventurous ride, owing to the angry astonishment into which it flung me for a moment, \u201cYou know, I told Bloch,\u201d Saint-Loup suddenly informed me, \u201cthat you didn\u2019t really think all that of him, that you found him rather vulgar at times. I\u2019m like that, you see, I want people to know where they stand,\u201d he wound up with a satisfied air and in a tone which brooked no reply. I was astounded. Not only had I the most absolute confidence in Saint-Loup, in the loyalty of his friendship, and he had betrayed it by what he had said to Bloch, but it seemed to me that he of all men ought to have been restrained from doing so, by his defects as well as by his good qualities, by that astonishing veneer of breeding which was capable of carrying politeness to what was positively a want of frankness. His triumphant air, was it what we assume to cloak a certain embarrassment in admitting a thing which we know that we ought not to have done, or did it mean complete unconsciousness; stupidity making a virtue out of a defect which I had not associated with him; a passing fit of ill humour towards me prompting him to make an end of our friendship, or the notation in words of a passing fit of ill humour in the company of Bloch to whom he had felt that he must say something disagreeable, even although I should be compromised by it? However that might be, his face was seared, while he uttered this vulgar speech, by a frightful sinuosity which I saw on it once or twice only in all the time I knew him, and which, beginning by running more or less down the middle of his face, when it came to his lips twisted them, gave them a hideous expression of baseness, almost of bestiality, quite transitory and no doubt inherited. There must have been at such moments, which recurred probably not more than once every other year, a partial eclipse of his true self by the passage across it of the personality of some ancestor whose shadow fell on him. Fully as much as his satisfied air, the words: \u201cI want people to know where they stand,\u201d encouraged the same doubt and should have incurred a similar condemnation. I felt inclined to say to him that if one wants people to know where they stand one ought to confine these outbursts of frankness to one\u2019s own affairs and not to acquire a too easy merit at the expense of others. But by this time the carriage had stopped outside the restaurant, the huge front of which, glazed and streaming with light, alone succeeded in piercing the darkness. The fog itself, beside the comfortable brightness of the lighted interior, seemed to be waiting outside on the pavement to shew one the way in with the joy of servants whose faces reflect the hospitable instincts of their master; shot with the most delicate shades of light, it pointed the way like the pillar of fire which guided the Children of Israel. Many of whom, as it happened, were to be found inside. For this was the place to which Bloch and his friends had long been in the habit, maddened by a hunger as famishing as the Ritual Fast, which at least occurs only once a year, for coffee and the satisfaction of political curiosity, of repairing in the evenings. Every mental excitement creating a value that overrides others, a quality superior to the rest of one\u2019s habits, there is no taste at all keenly developed that does not thus gather round it a society which it unites and in which the esteem of his fellows is what each of its members seeks before anything else from life. Here, in their caf\u00e9, be it in a little provincial town, you will find impassioned music-lovers; the greater part of their time, all their spare cash is spent in chamber-concerts, in meetings for musical discussion, in caf\u00e9s where one finds oneself among musical people and rubs shoulders with the members of the orchestra. Others, keen upon flying, seek to stand well with the old waiter in the glazed bar perched on top of the aerodrome; sheltered from the wind as in the glass cage of a lighthouse, they can follow in the company of an airman who is not going up that day the evolutions of a pilot practising loops, while another, invisible a moment ago, comes suddenly swooping down to land with the great winged roar of an Arabian roc. The little group which met to try to perpetuate, to explore the fugitive emotions aroused by the Zola trial attached a similar importance to this particular caf\u00e9. But they were not viewed with favour by the young nobles who composed the rest of its patrons and had taken possession of a second room, separated from the other only by a flimsy parapet topped with a row of plants. These looked upon Dreyfus and his supporters as traitors, albeit twenty-five years later, ideas having had time to classify themselves and Dreyfusism to acquire, in the light of history, a certain distinction, the sons, dance-mad Bolshevists, of these same young nobles were to declare to the \u2018intellectuals\u2019 who questioned them that undoubtedly, had they been alive at the time, they would have stood up for Dreyfus, without having any clearer idea of what the great Case had been about than Comtesse Edmond de Pourtal\u00e8s or the Marquise de Galliffet, other luminaries already extinct at the date of their birth. For on the night of the fog the noblemen of the caf\u00e9, who were in^ due course to become the fathers of these young intellectuals, Dreyfusards in retrospect, were still bachelors. Naturally the idea of a rich marriage was present in the minds of all their families, but none of them had yet brought such a marriage off. While still potential, the only effect of this rich marriage, the simultaneous ambition of several of them (there were indeed several heiresses in view, but after all the number of big dowries was considerably below that of the aspirants to them), was to create among these young men a certain amount of rivalry\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As ill luck would have it, Saint-Loup remaining outside for a minute to explain to the driver that he was to call for us again after dinner, I had to make my way in by myself. In the first place, once I had involved myself in the spinning door, to which I was not accustomed, I began to fear that I should never succeed in escaping from it. (Let me note here for the benefit of lovers of verbal accuracy that the contrivance in question, despite its peaceful appearance, is known as a \u2018revolver,\u2019 from the English \u2018revolving door.\u2019) This evening the proprietor, not venturing either to brave the elements outside or to desert his customers, remained standing near the entrance so as to have the pleasure of listening to the joyful complaints of the new arrivals, all aglow with the satisfaction of people who have had difficulty in reaching a place and have been afraid of losing their way. The smiling cordiality of his welcome was, however, dissipated by the sight of a stranger incapable of disengaging himself from the rotating sheets of glass. This flagrant sign of social ignorance made him knit his brows like an examiner who has a good mind not to utter the formula: Dignus est intrare. As a crowning error I went to look for a seat in the room set apart for the nobility, from which he at once expelled me, indicating to me, with a rudeness to which all the waiters at once conformed, a place in the other room. This was all the less to my liking because the seat was in the middle of a crowded row and I had opposite me the door reserved for the Hebrews which, as it did not revolve, opening and shutting at every moment kept me in a horrible draught. But the proprietor declined to move me, saying: \u201cNo, Sir, I cannot have the whole place upset for you.\u201d Presently, however, he forgot this belated and troublesome guest, captivated as he was by the arrival of each newcomer who, before calling for his beer, his wing of cold chicken or his hot grog (it was by now long past dinner-time), must first, as in the old romances, pay his scot by relating his adventure at the moment of his entry into this asylum of warmth and security where the contrast with the perils just escaped made that gaiety and sense of comradeship prevail which create a cheerful harmony round the campfire\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One reported that his carriage, thinking it had got to the Pont de la Concorde, had circled three times round the Invalides, another that his, in trying to make its way down the Avenue des Champs-Elys\u00e9es, had driven into a clump of trees at the Rond Point, from which it had taken him three quarters of an hour to get clear. Then followed lamentations upon the fog, the cold, the deathly stillness of the streets, uttered and received with the same exceptionally jovial air, which was accounted for by the pleasant atmosphere of the room which, except where I sat, was warm, the dazzling light which set blinking eyes already accustomed to not seeing, and the buzz of talk which restored their activity to deafened ears\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was all the newcomers could do to keep silence. The singularity of the mishaps which each of them thought unique burned their tongues, and their eyes roved in search of some one to engage in conversation. The proprietor himself lost all sense of social distinction. \u201cM. le Prince de Foix lost his way three times coming from the Porte Saint-Martin,\u201d he was not afraid to say with a laugh, actually pointing out, as though introducing one to the other, the illustrious nobleman to an Israelite barrister, who, on any evening but this, would have been divided from him by a barrier far harder to surmount than the ledge of greenery. \u201cThree times \u2014 fancy that!\u201d said the barrister, touching his hat. This note of personal interest was not at all to the Prince\u2019s liking. He formed one of an aristocratic group for whom the practice of impertinence, even at the expense of their fellow-nobles when these were not of the very highest rank, seemed the sole possible occupation. Not to acknowledge a bow, and, if the polite stranger repeated the offence, to titter with sneering contempt or fling back one\u2019s head with a look of fury, to pretend not to know some elderly man who might have done them a service, to reserve their handclasp for dukes and the really intimate friends of dukes whom the latter introduced to them, such was the attitude of these young men, and especially of the Prince de Foix. Such an attitude was encouraged by the ill-balanced mentality of early manhood (a period in which, even in the middle class, one appears ungrateful and behaves like a cad because, having forgotten for months to write to a benefactor after he has lost his wife, one then ceases to nod to him in the street so as to simplify matters), but it was inspired above all by an over-acute caste snobbishness. It is true that, after the fashion of certain nervous affections the symptoms of which grow less pronounced in later life, this snobbishness was on the whole to cease to express itself in so offensive a form in these men who had been so intolerable when young. Once youth is outgrown, it is seldom that anyone remains hidebound by insolence. He had supposed it to be the only thing in the world; suddenly he discovers, for all the Prince that he is, that there also are such things as music, literature, even standing for parliament. The scale of human values is correspondingly altered and he joins in conversation with people whom at one time he would have slain with a glare of lightning. Which is fortunate for those of the latter who have had the patience to wait, and whose character is sufficiently formed \u2014 if one may so put it \u2014 for them to feel pleasure in receiving in their forties the civility and welcome that had been coldly withheld from them at twenty\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As I have mentioned the Prince de Foix, it may not be inconsequent here to add that he belonged to a set of a dozen or fifteen young men and to an inner group of four. The dozen or fifteen shared this characteristic (which the Prince lacked, I fancy) that each of them faced the world in a dual aspect. Up to their own eyes in debt, they were of no account in those of their tradesmen, notwithstanding the pleasure these took in addressing them as \u2018Monsieur le Comte,\u2019 \u2018Monsieur le Marquis,\u2019 \u2018Monsieur le Duc.\u2019 They hoped to retrieve their fortunes by means of the famous rich marriage (\u2018money-bags\u2019 as the expression still was) and, as the fat dowries which they coveted numbered at the most four or five, several of them would be silently training their batteries on the same damsel. And the secret would be so well kept that when one of them, on arriving at the caf\u00e9, announced: \u201cMy dear fellows, I am too fond of you all not to tell you of my engagement to Mlle. d\u2019Ambresac,\u201d there was a general outburst, more than one of the others imagining that the marriage was as good as settled already between Mlle. d\u2019Ambresac and himself, and not having enough self-control to stifle a spontaneous cry of stupefaction and rage. \u201cSo you like the idea of marriage, do you Bibi?\u201d the Prince de Ch\u00e2tellerault could not help exclaiming, letting his fork drop in his surprise and despair, for he had been fully expecting the engagement of this identical Mlle. d\u2019Ambresac to be announced, but with himself, Ch\u00e2tellerault, as her bridegroom. And heaven only knew all that his father had cunningly hinted to the Ambresacs against Bibi\u2019s mother. \u201cSo you think it\u2019ll be fun, being married, do you?\u201d he was impelled to repeat his question to Bibi, who, better prepared to meet it, for he had had plenty of time to decide on the right attitude to adopt since the engagement had reached the semi-official stage, replied with a smile: \u201cWhat pleases me is not the idea of marriage, which never appealed much to me, but marrying Daisy d\u2019Ambresac, whom I think charming.\u201d In the time taken up by this response M. de Ch\u00e2tellerault had recovered his composure, but he was thinking that he must at the earliest possible moment execute a change of front in the direction of Mlle. de la Canourque or Miss Foster, numbers two and three on the list of heiresses, pacify somehow the creditors who were expecting the Ambresac marriage and finally explain to the people to whom he too had declared that Mlle. d\u2019Ambresac was charming that this marriage was all very well for Bibi, but that he himself would have had all his family down on him like a ton of bricks if he had married her. Mme. Sol\u00e9on (he decided to say) had actually announced that she would not have them in her house\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But if in the eyes of tradesmen, proprietors of restaurants and the like they seemed of little account, conversely, being creatures of dual personality, the moment they appeared in society they ceased to be judged by the decay of their fortunes and the sordid occupations by which they sought to repair them. They became once more M. le Prince this, M. le Duc that and were reckoned only in terms of their quarterings. A duke who was prac^ tically a multi-millionaire and seemed to combine in his own person every possible distinction gave precedence to them because, the heads of their various houses, they were by descent sovereign princes of minute territories in which they were entitled to coin money and so forth. Often in this caf\u00e9 one of them lowered his eyes when another came in so as not to oblige the newcomer to greet him. This was because in his imaginative pursuit of riches he had invited a banker to dine. Every time that a man about town enters into relations, on this footing, with a banker, the latter leaves him the poorer by a hundred thousand francs, which does not prevent the man about town from at once repeating the process with another. We continue to burn candles in churches and to consult doctors\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But the Prince de Foix, who was rich already, belonged not only to this fashionable set of fifteen or so young men, but to a more exclusive and inseparable group of four which included Saint-Loup. These were never asked anywhere separately, they were known as the four gigolos, they were always to be seen riding together, in country houses their hostesses gave them communicating bedrooms, with the result that, especially as they were all four extremely good looking, rumours were current as to the extent of their intimacy. I was in a position to give these the lie direct so far as Saint-Loup was concerned. But the curious thing is that if, later on, one was to learn that these rumours were true of all four, each of the quartet had been entirely in the dark as to the other three. And yet each of them had done his utmost to find out about the others, to gratify a desire or (more probably) a resentment, to prevent a marriage or to secure a hold over the friend whose secret he discovered. A fifth (for in these groups of four there are never four only) had joined this Platonic party who was more so than any of the others. But religious scruples restrained him until long after the group had broken up, and he himself was a married man, the father of a family, fervently praying at Lourdes that the next baby might be a boy or a girl, and spending the intervals of procreation in the pursuit of soldiers\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Despite the Prince\u2019s code of manners, the fact that the barrister\u2019s comment, though uttered in his hearing, had not been directly addressed to him made him less angry than he would otherwise have been. Besides, this evening was somewhat exceptional. Finally, the barrister had no more prospect of coming to know the Prince de Foix than the cabman who had driven that noble lord to the restaurant. The Prince felt, accordingly, that he might allow himself to reply, in an arrogant tone, as though speaking to some one \u2018off stage,\u2019 to this stranger who, thanks to the fog, was in the position of a travelling companion whom one meets at some seaside place at the ends of the earth, scoured by all the winds of heaven or shrouded in mist: \u201cLosing your way\u2019s nothing; the trouble is, you can\u2019t find it again.\u201d The wisdom of this aphorism impressed the proprietor, for he had already heard it several times in the course of the evening\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He was, in fact, in the habit of always comparing what he heard or read with an already familiar canon, and felt his admiration aroused if he could detect no difference. This state of mind is by no means to be ignored, for, applied to political conversations, to the reading of newspapers, it forms public opinion and thereby makes possible the greatest events in history. An aggregation of German landlords, simply by being impressed by a customer or a newspaper when he or it said that France, England and Russia were \u2018out to crush\u2019 Germany, made war, at the time of Agadir, possible, even if no war occurred. Historians, if they have not been wrong to abandon the practice of attributing the actions of peoples to the will of kings, ought to substitute for the latter the psychology of the person of no importance\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In politics the proprietor of this particular caf\u00e9 had for some time now concentrated his pupil-teacher\u2019s mind on certain particular details of the Dreyfus case. If he did not find the terms that were familiar to him in the conversation of a customer or the columns of a newspaper he would pronounce the article boring or the speaker insincere. The Prince de Foix, however, impressed him so forcibly that he barely gave him time to finish what he was saying. \u201cThat\u2019s right, Prince, that\u2019s right,\u201d (which meant neither more nor less than \u2018repeated without a mistake\u2019) \u201cthat\u2019s exactly how it is!\u201d he exclaimed, expanding, like people in the Arabian Nights \u2018to the limit of repletion.\u2019 But the Prince had by this time vanished into the smaller room. Then, as life resumes its normal course after even the most sensational happenings, those who had emerged from the sea of fog began to order whatever they wanted to eat or drink; among them a party of young men from the Jockey Club who, in view of the abnormality of the situation, had no hesitation in taking their places at a couple of tables in the big room, and were thus quite close to me. So the cataclysm had established even between the smaller room and the bigger, among all these people stimulated by the comfort of the restaurant after their long wanderings across the ocean of fog, a familiarity from which I alone was excluded, not unlike the spirit that must have prevailed in Noah\u2019s ark. Suddenly I saw the landlord\u2019s body whipped into a series of bows, the head waiters hurrying to support him in a full muster which drew every eye towards the door. \u201cQuick, send Cyprien here, lay a table for M. le Marquis de Saint-Loup,\u201d cried the proprietor, for whom Robert was not merely a great nobleman possessing a real importance even in the eyes of the Prince de Foix, but a client who drove through life four-in-hand, so to speak, and spent a great deal of money in this restaurant. The customers in the big room looked on with interest, those in the small room shouted simultaneous greetings to their friend as he finished wiping his shoes. But just as he was about to make his way into the small room he caught sight of me in the big one. \u201cGood God,\u201d he exclaimed, \u201cwhat on earth are you doing there? And with the door wide open too?\u201d he went on, with an angry glance at the proprietor, who ran to shut it, throwing the blame on his staff: \u201cI\u2019m always telling them to keep it shut.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I had been obliged to shift my own table and to disturb others which stood in the way in order to reach him. \u201cWhy did you move? Would you sooner dine here than in the little room? Why, my poor fellow, you\u2019re freezing. You will oblige me by keeping that door locked;\u201d he turned to the proprietor. \u201cThis very instant, M. le Marquis; the gentlemen will have to go out of this room through the other, that is all.\u201d And the better to shew his zeal he detailed for this operation a head waiter and several satel lites, vociferating the most terrible threats of punishment were it not properly carried out. He began to shew me exaggerated marks of respect so as to make me forget that these had begun not upon my arrival but only after that of Saint-Loup, while, lest I should think them to have been prompted by the friendliness shewn me by his rich and noble client he gave me now and again a surreptitious little smile which seemed to indicate a regard that was wholly personal\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Something said by one of the diners behind me made me turn my head for a moment. I had caught, instead of the words: \u201cWing of chicken, excellent; and a glass of champagne, only not too dry,\u201d the unexpected: \u201cI should prefer glycerine. Yes, hot, excellent.\u201d I wanted to see who the ascetic was that was inflicting upon himself such a diet. I turned quickly back to Saint-Loup so as not to be recognised by the man of strange appetite. It was simply a doctor, whom I happened to know, and of whom another customer, taking advantage of the fog to buttonhole him here in the caf\u00e9, was asking his professional advice. Like stockbrokers, doctors employ the first person singular\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Meanwhile I was studying Saint-Loup, and my thoughts took a line of their own. They were in this caf\u00e9, I had myself known at other times, plenty of foreigners, intellectuals, budding geniuses of all sorts, resigned to the laughter excited by their pretentious capes, their 1830 neckties and still more by the clumsiness of their movements, going so far as to provoke that laughter in order to shew that they paid no heed to it, who yet were men of real intellectual and moral worth, of an extreme sensibility. They repelled \u2014 the Jews among them principally, the unassimilated Jews, that is to say, for with the other kind we are not concerned \u2014 those who could not endure any oddity or eccentricity of appearance (as Bloch repelled Al-bertine). Generally speaking, one realised afterwards that if they had against them hair worn too long, noses and eyes that were too big, stilted theatrical gestures, it was puerile to judge them by these only, they had plenty of intelligence and spirit and were men to whom, in the long run, one could become closely attached. Among the Jews especially there were few whose parents and kinsfolk had not a warmth of heart, a breadth of mind in comparison with which Saint-Loup\u2019s mother and the Duc de Guermantes cut the poorest of figures by their sereness, their skin-deep religiosity which denounced only the most open scandals, their apology for a Christianity which led invariably (by the unexpected channel of a purely calculating mind) to an enormously wealthy marriage. But in Saint-Loup, when all was said, however the faults of his relatives might be combined in a fresh creation of character, there reigned the most charming openness of mind and heart. And whenever (it must be frankly admitted, to the undying glory of France) these qualities are found in a man who is purely French, be he noble or plebeian, they flower \u2014 flourish would be too strong a word, for a sense of proportion persists and also a certain restraint \u2014 with a grace which the foreign visitor, however estimable he may be, does not present to us. Of these intellectual and moral qualities others undoubtedly have their share, and if we have first to overcome what repels us and what makes us smile they remain no less precious. But it is all the same a pleasant thing, and one which is perhaps exclusively French that what is fine from the standpoint of equity, what is of value to the heart and mind should be first of all attractive to the eyes, charmingly coloured, consummately chiselled, should express outwardly as well in substance as in form an inward perfection. I studied Saint-Loup\u2019s features and said to myself that it is a thing to be glad of when there is no lack of bodily grace to prepare one for the graces within, and when the winged nostrils are spread as delicately and with as perfect a design as the wings of the little butterflies that hover over the field-flowers round Combray; and that the true opus francigenum, the secret of which was not lost in the thirteenth century, the beauty of which would not be lost with the destruction of our churches, consists not so much in the stone angels of Saint-Andr\u00e9-des-Champs as in the young sons of France, noble, citizen or peasant, whose faces are carved with that delicacy and boldness which have remained as traditional there as on the famous porch, but are creative still as well\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After leaving us for a moment in order to supervise personally the barring of the door and the ordering of our dinner (he laid great stress on our choosing \u2018butcher\u2019s meat,\u2019 the fowls being presumably nothing to boast of) the proprietor came back to inform us that M. le Prince de Foix would esteem it a favour if M. le Marquis would allow him to dine at a table next to ours. \u201cBut they are all taken,\u201d objected Robert, casting an eye over the tables which blocked the way to mine. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t matter in the least, if M. le Marquis would like it, I can easily ask these people to move to another table. It is always a pleasure to do anything for M. le Marquis!\u201d \u201cBut you must decide,\u201d said Saint-Loup to me. \u201cFoix is a good fellow, he may bore you or he may not; anyhow he\u2019s not such a fool as most of them.\u201d I told Robert that of course I should like to meet his friend but that now that I was for once in a way dining with him and was so entirely happy, I should be just as well pleased to have him all to myself. \u201cHe\u2019s got a very fine cloak, the Prince has,\u201d the proprietor broke in upon our deliberation. \u201cYes, I know,\u201d said Saint-Loup. I wanted to tell Robert that M. de Charlus had disclaimed all knowledge of me to his sister-in-law, and to ask him what could be the reason of this, but was prevented by the arrival of M. de Foix. Come to see whether his request had been favourably received, we caught sight of him standing beside our table. Robert introduced us, but did not hide from his friend that as we had things to talk about he would prefer not to be disturbed. The Prince withdrew, adding to the farewell bow which he made me a smile which, pointed at Saint-Loup, seemed to transfer to him the responsibility for the shortness of a meeting which the Prince himself would have liked to see prolonged. As he turned to go, Robert, struck, it appeared, by a sudden idea, dashed off after his friend, with a \u201cStay where you are and get on with your dinner, I shall be back in a moment,\u201d to me; and vanished into the smaller room. I was pained to hear the smart young men sitting near me, whom I did not know, repeat the most absurd and malicious stories about the young Hereditary Grand Duke of Luxembourg (formerly Comte de Nassau) whom I had met at Balbec and who had shewn me such delicate marks of sympathy at the time of my grandmother\u2019s illness. According to one of these young me he had said to the Duchesse de Guermantes: \u201cI expect everyone to get up when my wife passes,\u201d to which the Duchess had retorted (with as little truth, had she said any such thing, as humour, the grandmother of the young Princess having always been the very pink of propriety): \u201cGet up when your wife passes, do they? Well, that\u2019s a change from her grandmother\u2019s day. She expected the gentlemen to lie down.\u201d Then some one alleged that, having gone down to see his aunt the Princesse de Luxembourg at Balbec, and put up at the Grand Hotel, he had complained to the manager there (my friend) that the royal standard of Luxembourg was not flown in front of the hotel, over the sea. And that this flag being less familiar and less generally in use than the British or Italian, it had taken him several days to procure one, greatly to the young Grand Duke\u2019s annoyance. I did not believe a word of this story, but made up my mind, as soon as I went to Balbec, to inquire of the manager, so as to make certain that it was a pure invention. While waiting for Saint-Loup to return I asked the proprietor to get me some bread. \u201cCertainly, Monsieur le Baron!\u201d \u201cI am not a Baron,\u201d I told him. \u201cOh, beg pardon, Monsieur le Comte!\u201d I had no time to lodge a second protest which would certainly have promoted me to the rank of marquis; faithful to his promise of an immediate return, Saint-Loup reappeared in the doorway carrying over his arm the thick vicuna cloak of the Prince de Foix, from whom I guessed that he had borrowed it in order to keep me warm. He signed to me not to get up, and came towards me, but either my table would have to be moved again or I must change my seat if he was to get to his. Entering the big room he sprang lightly on to one of the red plush benches which ran round its walls and on which, apart from myself, there were sitting only three or four of the young men from the Jockey Club, friends of his own, who had not managed to find places in the other room. Between the tables and the wall electric wires were stretched at a certain height; without the least hesitation Saint-Loup jumped nimbly over them like a horse in a steeplechase; embarrassed that it should be done wholly for my benefit and to save me the trouble of a slight movement, I was at the same time amazed at the precision with which my friend performed this exercise in l\u00e9vitation; and in this I was not alone; for, albeit they would probably have had but little admiration for a similar display on the part of a more humbly born and less generous client, the proprietor and his staff stood fascinated, like racegoers in the enclosure; one underling, apparently rooted to the ground, stood there gaping with a dish in his hand for which a party close beside him were waiting; and when Saint-Loup, having to get past his friends, climbed on the narrow ledge behind them and ran along it, balancing himself with his arms, discreet applause broke from the body of the room. On coming to where I was sitting he stopped short in his advance with the precision of a tributary chieftain before the throne of a sovereign, and, stooping down, handed to me with an air of courtesy and submission the vicuna cloak which, a moment later, having taken his place beside me, without my having to make a single movement he arranged as a light but warm shawl about my shoulders\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBy the way, while I think of it, my uncle Charlus has something to say to you. I promised I\u2019d send you round to him to-morrow evening.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI was just going to speak to you about him. But to-morrow evening I am dining with your aunt Guermantes.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYes there\u2019s a regular beanfeast to-morrow at Oriane\u2019s. I\u2019m not asked. But my uncle Palam\u00e8de doesn\u2019t want you to go there. You can\u2019t get out of it, I suppose? Well, anyhow, go on to my uncle\u2019s afterwards. I\u2019m sure he really does want to see you. Look here, you can easily manage to get there by eleven. Eleven o\u2019clock; don\u2019t forget; I\u2019ll let him know. He\u2019s very touchy. If you don\u2019t turn up he\u2019ll never forgive you. And Oriane\u2019s parties are always over quite early. If you are only going to dine there you can quite easily be at my uncle\u2019s by eleven. I ought really to go and see Oriane, about getting shifted from Morocco; I want an exchange. She is so nice about all that sort of thing, and she can get anything she likes out of General de Saint-Joseph, who runs that branch. But don\u2019t say anything about it to her. I\u2019ve mentioned it to the Princesse de Parme, everything will be all right. Interesting place, Morocco. I could tell you all sorts of things. Very fine lot of men out there. One feels they\u2019re on one\u2019s own level, mentally.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou don\u2019t think the Germans are going to go to war about it?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo; they\u2019re annoyed with us, as after all they have every right to be. But the Emperor is out for peace. They are always making us think they want war, to force us to give in. Pure bluff, you know, like poker. The Prince of Monaco, one of Wilhelm\u2019s agents, comes and tells us in confidence that Germany will attack us. Then we give way. But if we didn\u2019t give way, there wouldn\u2019t be war in any shape or form. You have only to think what a comic spectacle a war would be in these days. It\u2019d be a bigger catastrophe than the Flood and the G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung rolled in one. Only it wouldn\u2019t last so long.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He spoke to me of friendship, affection, regret, albeit like all visitors of his sort he was going off the next morning for some months, which he was to spend in the country, and would only be staying a couple of nights in Paris on his way back to Morocco (or elsewhere); but the words which he thus let fall into the heated furnace which my heart was this evening kindled a pleasant glow there. Our infrequent meetings, this one in particular, have since formed a distinct episode in my memories. For him, as for me, this was the evening of friendship. And yet the friendship that I felt for him at this moment was scarcely, I feared (and felt therefore some remorse at the thought), what he would have liked to inspire. Filled still with the pleasure that I had had in seeing him come bounding towards me and gracefully pause on arriving at his goal, I felt that this pleasure lay in my recognising that each of the series of movements which he had developed against the wall, along the bench, had its meaning, its cause in Saint-Loup\u2019s own personal nature, possibly, but even more in that which by birth and upbringing he had inherited from his race\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A certainty of taste in the region not of beauty but manners, which when he was faced by a novel combination of circumstances enabled the man of breeding to grasp at once \u2014 like a musician who has been asked to play a piece he has never seen \u2014 the feeling, the motions that were required, and to apply the appropriate mechanism and technique; which then allowed this taste to display itself without the constraint of any other consideration, by which the average young man of the middle class would have been paralysed, from fear as well of making himself ridiculous in the eyes of strangers by his disregard of convention as of appearing too deferential in the eyes of his friends; the place of this constraint being taken in Robert by a lofty disdain which certainly he had never felt in his heart but which he had received by inheritance in his body, and which had moulded the attitudes of his ancestors to a familiarity with their inferiors which, they imagined, could only flatter and enchant those to whom it was displayed; lastly, a noble liberality which, taking no account of his boundless natural advantages (lavish expenditure in this restaurant had succeeded in making him, here as elsewhere, the most fashionable customer and the general favourite, a position which was underlined by the deference shewn him throughout the place not only by the waiters but by all its most exclusive young patrons), led him to trample them underfoot, just as he had, actually and symbolically, trodden upon those benches decked with purple, like a triumphal way which pleased my friend only because it enabled him more gracefully and swiftly to arrive at my side; such were the qualities, essential to aristocracy, which through the husk of this body, not opaque and vague as mine would have been, but significant and limpid, transmitted as through a work of art the industrious, energetic force which had created it and rendered the movements of this lightfoot course which Robert had pursued along the wall intelligible and charming as those of a row of knights upon a marble frieze. \u201cAlas!\u201d Robert might have thought, \u201cwas it worth while to have grown up despising birth, honouring only justice and intellect, choosing outside the ranks of the friends provided for me companions who were awkward and ill-dressed, provided they had the gift of eloquence, only for the sole personality apparent in me, which is to remain a treasured memory, to be not that which my will, with the most praiseworthy effort, has fashioned in my likeness, but one which is not of my making, which is not even myself, which I have always disliked and striven to overcome; was it worth while to love my chosen friend as I have loved him, for the greatest pleasure that he can find in me to be that of discovering something far more general than myself, a pleasure which is not in the least (as he says, though he cannot seriously believe it) one of the pleasures of friendship, but an intellectual and detached, a sort of artistic pleasure?\u201d This is what I am now afraid that Saint-Loup may at times have thought. If so, he was mistaken. If he had not (as he steadfastly had) cherished something more lofty than the suppleness innate in his body, if he had not kept aloof for so long from the pride that goes with noble birth, there would have been something more studied, a certain heaviness in his very agility, a self-important vulgarity in his manners. As with Mme. de Villeparisis a strong vein of seriousness had been necessary for her to give in her conversation and in her Memoirs a sense of the frivolous, which is intellectual, so, in order that Saint-Loup\u2019s body might be indwelt by so much nobility, the latter had first to desert a mind that was aiming at higher things, and, reabsorbed into his body, to be fixed there in unconscious, noble lines. In this way his distinction of mind was not absent from a bodily distinction which otherwise would not have been complete. An artist has no need to express his mind directly in his work for it to express the quality of that mind; it has indeed been said that the highest praise of God consists in the denial of Him by the atheist, who finds creation so perfect that it can dispense with a creator. And I was quite well aware that it was not merely a work of art that I was admiring in this young man unfolding along the wall the frieze of his flying course; the young Prince (a descendant of Catherine de Foix, Queen of Navarre and grand-daughter of Charles VII) whom he had just left for my sake, the endowments, by birth and fortune, which he was laying at my feet, the proud and shapely ancestors who survived in the assurance, the agility, the courtesy with which he now arranged about my shivering body the warm woollen cloak, were not all these like friends of longer standing in his life, by whom I might have expected that we should be permanently kept apart, and whom, on the contrary, he was sacrificing to me by a choice which one can make only in the loftiest places of the mind, with that sovereign liberty of which Robert\u2019s movements were the presentment and in which is realised perfect friendship?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0How much familiar intercourse with a Guermantes \u2014 in place of the distinction that it had in Robert, because there the inherited scorn of humanity was but the outer garment, become an unconscious charm, of a real moral humility \u2014 could disclose of vulgar arrogance I had had an opportunity of seeing, not in M. de Charlus, in whom certain characteristic faults, for which I had been unable, so far, to account, were overlaid upon his aristocratic habits, but in the Duc de Guermantes. And yet he too, in the general impression of commonness which had so strongly repelled my grandmother when she had met him once, years earlier, at Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s, included glimpses of historic grandeur of which I became conscious when I went to dine in his house, on the evening following that which I had spent with Saint-Loup\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0They had not been apparent to me either in himself or in the Duchess when I had met them first in their aunt\u2019s drawing-room, any more than I had discerned, on first seeing her, the differences that set Berma apart from her fellow-players, all the more that in her the individuality was infinitely more striking than in any social celebrity, such distinctions becoming more marked in proportion as the objects are more real, more conceivable by the intellect. And yet, however slight the shades of social distinction may be (and so slight are they that when an accurate portrayer like Sainte-Beuve tries to indicate the shades of difference between the salons of Mme. Geoffrin, Mme. R\u00e9camier and Mme. de Boigne, they appear so much alike that the cardinal truth which, unknown to the author, emerges from his investigations is the vacuity of that form of life), with them, and for the same reason as with Berma, when the Guermantes had ceased to impress me and the tiny drop of their originality was no longer vaporised by my imagination, I was able to distil and analyse it, imponderable as it was\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Duchess having made no reference to her husband when she talked to me at her aunt\u2019s party, I wondered whether, in view of the rumours of a divorce that were current, he would be present at the dinner. But my doubts were speedily set at rest, for through the crowd of footmen who stood about in the hall and who (since they must until then have regarded me much as they regarded the children of the evicted cabinet-maker, that is to say with more fellow-feeling perhaps than their master but as a person incapable of being admitted to his house) must have been asking themselves to what this social revolution could be due, I saw slip towards me M. de Guermantes himself, who had been watching for my arrival so as to receive me upon his threshold and take off my greatcoat with his own hands\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMme. de Guermantes will be as pleased as punch,\u201d he greeted me in a glibly persuasive tone. \u201cLet me help you off with your duds.\u201d (He felt it to be at once companionable and comic to employ the speech of the people.) \u201cMy wife was just the least bit afraid you might fail us, although you had fixed a date. We\u2019ve been saying to each other all day long: \u2018Depend upon it, he\u2019ll never turn up.\u2019 I am bound to say, Mme. de Guermantes was a better prophet than I was. You are not an easy man to get hold of, and I was quite sure you were going to play us false.\u201d And the Duke was so bad a husband, so brutal even (people said), that one felt grateful to him, as one feels grateful to wicked people for their occasional kindness of heart, for those words \u2018Mme. de Guermantes\u2019 with which he appeared to be spreading out over the Duchess a protecting wing, that she might be but one flesh with him. Meanwhile, taking me familiarly by the hand, he began to lead the way, to introduce me into his household. Just as some casual phrase may delight us coming from the lips of a peasant if it points to the survival of a local tradition, shews the trace of some historic event unknown, it may be, to him who thus alludes to it; so this politeness on the part of M. de Guermantes, which, moreover, he was to continue to shew me throughout the evening, charmed me as a survival of habits of many centuries\u2019 growth, habits of the seventeenth century in particular. The people of bygone ages seem to us infinitely remote. We do not feel justified in ascribing to them any underlying intention apart from those to which they give formal expression; we are amazed when we come upon a sentiment more or less akin to what we are feeling to-day in a Homeric hero, or upon a skilful tactical feint in Hannibal, during the buttle of Cannae, where he let his flank be driven back in order to take the enemy by surprise and surround him; it would seem that we imagined the epic poet and the Punic general as being as remote from ourselves as an animal seen in a zoological garden. Even in certain personages of the court of Louis XIV, when we find signs of courtesy in the letters written by them to some man of inferior rank who could be of no service to them whatever, they leave us bewildered because they reveal to us suddenly, as existing among these great gentlemen, a whole world of beliefs to which they never give any direct expression but which govern their conduct, and especially the belief that they are bound in politeness to feign certain sentiments and to carry out with the most scrupulous care certain obligations of friendship\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This imagined remoteness of the past is perhaps one of the things that enable us to understand how even great writers have found an inspired beauty in the works of mediocre mystifiers, such as Macpherson\u2019s Ossian. We so little expected to learn that bards long dead could have modern ideas that we marvel if in what we believe to be an ancient Gaelic ode we come upon one which we should have thought, at the most, ingenious in a contemporary. A translator of talent has simply to add to an ancient writer whom he presents to us more or less faithfully reproduced fragments which, signed with a contemporary name and published separately, would seem entertaining only; at once he imparts a moving grandeur to his poet, who is thus made to play upon the keyboards of several ages at once. This translator was capable only of a mediocre book, if that book had been published as his original work. Given out as a translation, it seems that of a masterpiece. The past not merely is not fugitive, it remains present. It is not within a few months only after the outbreak of a war that laws passed without haste can effectively influence its course, it is not within fifteen years only after a crime which has remained obscure that a magistrate can still find the vital evidence which will throw a light on it; after hundreds and thousands of years the scholar who has been studying in a distant land the place-names, the customs of the inhabitants, may still extract from them some legend long anterior to the Christian era, already unintelligible, if not actually forgotten, at the time of Herodotus, which in the name given to a rock, in a religious rite, dwells surrounded by the present, like an emanation of greater density, immemorial and stable. There was similarly an emanation, though far less ancient, of the life of the court, if not in the manners of M. de Guermantes, which were often vulgar, at least in the mind that controlled them. I was to breathe this again, like the odour of antiquity, when I joined him a little later in the drawing-room. For I did not go there at once\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As we left the outer hall, I had mentioned to M. de Guermantes that I was extremely anxious to see his Elstirs. \u201cI am at your service. Is M. Elstir a friend of yours, then? If so, it is most vexing, for I know him slightly; he is a pleasant fellow, what our fathers used to call an \u2018honest fellow\u2019; I might have asked him to honour us with his company, and to dine tonight. I am sure he would have been highly flattered at being invited to spend the evening in your society.\u201d Very little suggestive of the old order when he tried thus to assume its manner, the Duke relapsed unconsciously into it. After inquiring whether I wished him to shew me the pictures, he conducted me to them, gracefully standing aside for me at each door, apologising when, to shew me the way, he was obliged to precede me, a little scene which (since the days when Saint-Simon relates that an ancestor of the Guermantes did him the honours of his town house with the same punctilious exactitude in the performance of the frivolous duties of a gentleman) must, before coming gradually down to us, have been enacted by many other Guermantes for numberless other visitors. And as I had said to the Duke that I would like very much to be left alone for a few minutes with the pictures, he discreetly withdrew, telling me that I should find him in the drawing-room when I was ready\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Only, once I was face to face with the Elstirs, I completely forgot about dinner and the time; here again as at Balbec I had before me fragments of that strangely coloured world which was no more than the projection, the way of seeing things peculiar to that great painter, which his speech in no way expressed. The parts of the walls that were covered by paintings from his brush, all homogeneous with one another, were like the luminous images of a magic lantern, which would have been in this instance the brain of the artist, and the strangeness of which one could never have suspected so long as one had known only the man, which was like seeing the iron lantern boxing its lamp before any coloured slide had been slid into its groove. Among these pictures several of the kind that seemed most absurd to ordinary people interested me more than the rest because they recreated those optical illusions which prove to us that we should never succeed in identifying objects if we did not make some process of reasoning intervene How often, when driving in the dark, do we not come upon a long, lighted street which begins a few feet away from us, when what we have actually before our eyes is nothing but a rectangular patch of wall with a bright light falling on it, which has given us the mirage of depth. In view of which is it not logical, not by any artifice of symbolism but by a sincere return to the very root of the impression, to represent one thing by that other for which, in the flash of a first illusion, we mistook it? Surfaces and volumes are in reality independent of the names of objects which our memory imposes on them after we have recognised them. Elstir attempted to wrest from what he had just felt what he already knew, his effort had often been to break up that aggregate of impressions which we call vision\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The people who detested these \u2018horrors\u2019 were astonished to find that Elstir admired Chardin, Perroneau, any number of painters whom they, the ordinary men and women of society, liked. They did not take into account that Elstir had had to make, for his own part, in striving to reproduce reality (with the particular index of his taste for certain lines of approach), the same effort as a Chardin or a Perroneau and that consequently, when he ceased to work for himself, he admired in them attempts of the same order, fragments anticipatory so to speak of works of his own. Nor did these society people include in their conception of Elstir\u2019s work that temporal perspective which enabled them to like, or at least to look without discomfort at Chardin\u2019s painting. And yet the older among them might have reminded themselves that in the course of their lives they had seen gradually, as the years bore them away from it, the unbridgeable gulf between what they considered a masterpiece by Ingres and what, they had supposed, must remain for ever a \u2018horror\u2019 (Manet\u2019sOlympia, for example) shrink until the two canvases seemed like twins. But we learn nothing from any lesson because we have not the wisdom to work backwards from the particular to the general, and imagine ourselves always to be going through an experience which is without precedents in the past\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I was moved by the discovery in two of the pictures (more realistic, these, and in an earlier manner) of the same person, in one in evening dress in his own drawing-room, in the other wearing a frock coat and tall hat at some popular regatta where he had evidently no business to be, which proved that for Elstir he was not only a regular sitter but a friend, perhaps a patron whom it pleased him (just as Carpaccio used to introduce prominent figures, and in speaking likenesses, from contemporary life in Venice) to introduce into his pictures, just as Beethoven, too, found pleasure in inscribing at the top of a favourite work the beloved name of the Archduke Rudolph. There was something enchanting about this waterside carnival. The river, the women\u2019s dresses, the sails of the boats, the innumerable reflexions of one thing and another came crowding into this little square panel of beauty which Elstir had cut out of a marvellous afternoon. What delighted one in the dress of a woman who had stopped for a moment in the dance because it was hot and she was out of breath was irresistible also in the same way in the canvas of a motionless sail, in the water of the little harbour, in the wooden bridge, in the leaves of the trees and in the sky. As in one of the pictures that I had seen at Balbec, the hospital, as beautiful beneath its sky of lapis lazuli as the cathedral itself, seemed (more bold than Elstir the theorician, then Elstir the man of taste, the lover of things mediaeval) to be intoning: \u201cThere is no such thing as gothic, there is no such thing as a masterpiece; this tasteless hospital is just as good as the glorious porch,\u201d so I now heard: \u201cThe slightly vulgar lady at whom a man of discernment would refrain from glancing as he passed her by, would except from the poetical composition which nature has set before him \u2014 her dress is receiving the same light as the sail of that boat, and there are no degrees of value and beauty; the commonplace dress and the sail, beautiful in itself, are two mirrors reflecting the same gleam; the value is all in the painter\u2019s eye.\u201d This eye had had the skill to arrest for all time the motion of the hours at this luminous instant, when the lady had felt hot and had stopped dancing, when the tree was fringed with a belt of shadow, when the sails seemed to be slipping over a golden glaze. But just because the depicted moment pressed on one with so much force, this so permanent canvas gave one the most fleeting impression, one felt that the lady would presently move out of it, the boats drift away, the night draw on, that pleasure comes to an end, that life passes and that the moments illuminated by the convergence, at once, of so many lights do not recur. I recognized yet another aspect, quite different it is true, of what the moment means in a series of water-colours of mythological subjects, dating from Elstir\u2019s first period, which also adorned this room. Society people who held \u2018advanced\u2019 views on art went \u2018as far as\u2019 this earliest manner, but no further. These were certainly not the best work that he had done, but already the sincerity with which the subject had been thought out melted its natural coldness. Thus the Muses, for instance, were represented as it might be creatures belonging to a species now fossilised, but creatures which it would not have been surprising in mythological times to see pass in the evening, in twos or threes, along some mountain path. Here and there a poet, of a race that had also a peculiar interest for the zoologist (characterised by a certain sexlessness) strolled with a Muse, as one sees in nature creatures of different but of kindred species consort together. In one of these water-colours one saw a poet wearied by long wanderings on the mountains, whom a Centaur, meeting him and moved to pity by his weakness, had taken on his back and was carrying home. In more than one other, the vast landscape (in which the mythical scene, the fabulous heroes, occupied a minute place and were almost lost) was rendered, from the mountain tops to the sea, with an exactitude which told one more than the hour, told one to the very minute what time of day ft was, thanks to the precise angle of the setting sun, to the fleeting fidelity of the shadows. In this way the artist managed to give, by making it instantaneous, a sort of historical reality, as of a thing actually lived, to the symbol of his fable, painted it and set it at a definite point in the past\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While I was examining Elstir\u2019s paintings the bell, rung by arriving guests had been pealing uninterruptedly, and had lulled me into a pleasing unconsciousness. But the silence which followed its clangour and had already lasted for some time succeeded \u2014 less rapidly, it is true \u2014 in awakening me from my dream, as the silence that follows Lindor\u2019s music arouses Bartolo from his sleep. I was afraid that I had been forgotten, that they had sat down to dinner, and hurried to the drawing-room. At the door of the Elstir gallery I found a servant waiting for me, white-haired, though whether with age or powder I cannot say, with the air of a Spanish Minister, but treating me with the same respect that he would have shewn to a King. I felt from his manner that he must have been waiting for at least an hour, and I thought with alarm of the delay I had caused in the service of dinner, especially as I had promised to be at M. de Charlus\u2019s by eleven\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Spanish Minister (though I also met on the way the footman persecuted by the porter, who, radiant with delight when I inquired after his girl, told me that the very next day they were both to be off duty, so that he would be able to spend the whole day with her, and extolled the generosity of Madame la Duchesse) conducted me to the drawing-room, where I was afraid of finding M. de Guermantes in an ill humour. He welcomed me, on the contrary, with a joy that was evidently to a certain extent artificial and dictated by politeness, but was also sincere, prompted both by his stomach which so long a delay had begun to famish, and his consciousness of a similar impatience in all his other guests, who completely filled the room. Indeed I heard afterwards that I had kept them waiting for nearly three-quarters of an hour. The Duc de Guermantes probably thought that to prolong the general torment for two minutes more would not intensify it and that, politeness having driven him to postpone for so long the moment of moving into the dining-room, this politeness would be more complete if, by not having dinner announced immediately, he could succeed in persuading me that I was not late, and that they had not been waiting for me. And so he asked me, as if we had still an hour before dinner and some of the party had not yet arrived, what I thought of his Elstirs. But at the same time, and without letting the cravings of his stomach become apparent, so as not to lose another moment, he, in concert with the Duchess, proceeded to the ceremony of introduction. Then only I perceived that there had occurred round about me, me who until this evening, save for my novitiate in Mme. Swann\u2019s drawing-room, had been accustomed, in my mother\u2019s homes, at Combray and in Paris, to the manners, either protecting or defensive, of the grim ladies of our middle-world, who treated me as a child, a change of surroundings comparable to that which introduces Parsifal suddenly into the midst of the Flower-Maidens. Those who surrounded me now, their bosoms entirely bare (the naked flesh appeared on either side of a sinuous spray of mimosa or behind the broad petals of a rose) could not murmur a word of greeting without at the same time bathing me in long, caressing glances, as though shyness alone restrained them from kissing me. Many of them were nevertheless highly respectable from the moral standpoint; many, not all, for the most virtuous had not for those of a lighter vein the same repulsion that my mother would have felt. The caprices of one\u2019s conduct, denied by saintlier friends, in the face of the evidence, seemed in the Guermantes world to matter far less than the relations which one had been able to maintain. One pretended not to know that the body of one\u2019s hostess was at the disposal of all comers, provided that her visiting list showed no gaps. As the Duke put himself out not at all for his other guests (of whom he had long known everything that there was to know, and they of him) but quite markedly for me, whose kind of superiority, being outside his experience, inspired in him something akin to the respect which the great nobleman of the court of Louis XIV used to feel for his plebeian Ministers, he evidently considered that the fact of my not knowing his other guests mattered not at all \u2014 to me at least, though it might to them \u2014 and while I was anxious, on his account, as to the impression that I was going to make on them he was thinking only of how his friends would impress me\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At the very outset I found myself completely bewildered. No sooner had I entered the drawing-room than M. de Guermantes, without even allowing me time to shake hands with the Duchess, had led me, as though I were a delightful surprise to the person in question to whom he seemed to be saying: \u201cHere\u2019s your friend! You see, I\u2019m bringing him to you by the scruff of his neck,\u201d towards a lady of smallish stature. Whereupon, long before, thrust forward by the Duke, I had reached her chair, the lady had begun to flash at me continuously from her large, soft, dark eyes the thousand smiles of understanding which we address to an old friend who perhaps has not recognised us. As this was precisely my case and I could not succeed in calling to mind who she was I averted my eyes from her as I approached so as not to have to respond until our introduction should have released me from my predicament. Meanwhile the lady continued to maintain in unstable equilibrium the smile intended for myself. She looked as though she were anxious to be relieved of it and to hear me say: \u201cOh, but this is a pleasure! Mamma will be pleased when I tell her I\u2019ve met you!\u201d I was as impatient to learn her name as she was to see that I did finally greet her, fully aware of what I was doing, so that the smile which she was holding on indefinitely, like the note of a tuning-fork, might at length be let go. But M. de Guermantes managed things so badly (to my mind, at least) that I seemed to have heard only my own name uttered and was given no clue to the identity of my unknown friend, to whom it never occurred to tell me herself what her name was, so obvious did the grounds of our intimacy, which baffled me completely, seem to her. Indeed, as soon as I had come within reach, she did not offer me her hand, but took mine in a familiar clasp, and spoke to me exactly as though I had been equally conscious with herself of the pleasant memories to which her mind reverted. She told me how sorry Albert (who, I gathered, was her son) would be to have missed seeing me. I tried to remember who, among the people I had known as boys, was called Albert, and could think only of Bloch, but this could not be Bloch\u2019s mother that I saw before me since she had been dead for some time. In vain I struggled to identify the past experience common to herself and me to which her thoughts had been carried back. But I could no more distinguish it through the translucent jet of her large, soft pupils which allowed only her smile to pierce their surface than one can distinguish a landscape that lies on the other side of a smoked glass, even when the sun is blazing on it. She asked me whether my father was not working too hard, if I would not come to the theatre some evening with Albert, if I was stronger now, and as my replies, stumbling through the mental darkness in which I was plunged, became distinct only to explain that I was not feeling well that evening, she pushed forward a chair for me herself, going to all sorts of trouble which I was not accustomed to see taken by my parents\u2019 friends. At length the clue to the riddle was furnished me by the Duke: \u201cShe thinks you\u2019re charming,\u201d he murmured in my ear, which felt somehow that it had heard these words before. They were what Mme. de Villeparisis had said to my grandmother and myself after we had made the acquaintance of the Princesse de Luxembourg. Everything became clear; the lady I now saw had nothing in common with Mme. de Luxembourg, but from the language of him who thus served me with her I could discern the nature of the animal. It was a Royalty. She had never before heard of either my family or myself, but, a scion of the noblest race and endowed with the greatest fortune in the world (for, a daughter of the Prince de Parme, she had married a cousin of equal princelihood), she sought always, in gratitude to her Creator, to testify to her neighbour, however poor or lowly he might be, that she did not look down upon him. Really, I might have guessed this from her smile. I had seen the Princesse de Luxembourg buy little rye-cakes on the beach at Balbec to give to my grandmother, as though to a caged deer in the zoological garden. But this was only the second Princess of the Blood Royal to whom I had been presented, and I might be excused my failure to discern in her the common factors of the friendliness of the great. Besides, had not they themselves gone out of their way to warn me not to count too much on this friendliness, since the Duchesse de Guermantes, who had waved me so effusive a greeting with her gloved hand at the Op\u00e9ra-Comique, had appeared furious when I bowed to her in the street, like people who, having once given somebody a sovereign, feel that this has set them free from any further obligation toward him. As for M. de Charlus, his ups and downs were even more sharply contrasted. While in the sequel I have known, as the reader will learn, Highnesses and Majesties of another sort altogether, Queens who play the Queen and speak not after the conventions of their kind but like the Queens in Sardou\u2019s plays\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If M. de Guermantes had been in such haste to present me, it was because the presence at a party of anyone not personally known to a Royal Personage is an intolerable state of things which must not be prolonged for a single instant. It was similar to the haste which Saint-Loup had shewn in making me introduce him to my grandmother. By the same token, by a fragmentary survival of the old life of the court which is called social courtesy and is not superficial, in which, rather, by a centripetal reversion, it is the surface that becomes essential and profound, the Due and Duchesse de Guermantes regarded as a duty more essential than those (which one at least of the pair neglected often enough) of charity, chastity, pity and justice, as a more unalterable law that of never addressing the Princesse de Parme save in the third person\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Having never yet in my life been to Parma (a pilgrimage I had been anxious to make ever since certain Easter holidays long ago), to meet its Princess, who, I knew, owned the finest palace in that matchless city, where, moreover, everything must be in keeping, isolated as it was from the rest of the world, within the polished walls, in the atmosphere, stifling as a breathless summer evening on the Piazza of a small town in Italy, of its compact and almost cloying name, would surely have substituted in a flash for what I had so often tried to imagine all that did really exist at Parma in a sort of partial arrival there, without my having to stir from Paris, of myself; it was in the algebraical expression of a journey to the city of Correggio a simple equation, so to speak, of that unknown quantity. But if I had for many years past \u2014 like a perfumer impregnating a solid mass of grease with scent \u2014 made this name, Princesse de Parme, absorb the fragrance of thousands of violets, in return, when I set eyes on the Princess, who, until then I should have sworn, must be the Sanseverina herself, a second process began which was not, I may say, completed until several months had passed, and consisted in expelling, by means of fresh chemical combinations, all the essential oil of violets and all the Stendhalian fragrance from the name of the Princess, and in implanting there, in their place, the image of a little dark woman, taken up with good works, of a friendliness so humble that one felt at once in how exalted a pride that friendliness had its roots. Moreover, while, barring a few points of difference, she was exactly like any other great lady, she was as little Stendhalian as is, for example, in Paris, in the Europe quarter, the Rue de Parme, which bears far less resemblance to the name of Parma than to any or all of the neighbouring streets, and reminds one not nearly so much of the Charterhouse in which Fabrice ends his days as of the waiting room in the Saint-Lazare station\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Her friendliness sprang from two causes. The first and more general was the education which this daughter of Kings had received. Her mother (not merely allied by blood to all the royal families of Europe but furthermore \u2014 in contrast to the Ducal House of Parma \u2014 richer than any reigning Princess) had instilled into her from her earliest childhood the arrogantly humble precepts of an evangelical snobbery; and to-day every line of the daughter\u2019s face, the curve of her shoulders, the movements of her arms seemed to repeat the lesson: \u201cRemember that if God has caused you to be born on the steps of a throne you ought not to make that a reason for looking down upon those to whom Divine Providence has willed (wherefore His Name be praised) that you should be superior by birth and fortune. On the contrary, you must suffer the little ones. Your ancestors were Princes of Treves and Juliers from the year 647: God has decreed in His bounty that you should hold practically all the shares in the Suez Canal and three times as many Royal Dutch as Edmond de Rothschild; your pedigree in a direct line has been established by genealogists from the year 63 of the Christian Era; you have as sisters-in-law two Empresses. Therefore never seem, in your speech, to be recalling these great privileges, not that they are precarious (for nothing can alter antiquity of race, while the world will always need petrol), but because it is useless to point out that you are better born than other people or that your investments are all gilt-edged, since everyone knows these facts already. Be helpful to the needy. Furnish to all those whom the bounty of Heaven has done you the favour of placing beneath you as much as you can give them without forfeiture of your rank, that is to say help in the form of money, even your personal service by their sickbeds, but never (bear well in mind) invite them to your parties, which would do them no possible good and, by weakening your own position, would diminish the efficacy of your benevolent activities.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And so even at the moments when she could not do good the Princess endeavoured to shew, or rather to let it be thought, by all the external signs of dumb language, that she did not consider herself superior to the people among whom she found herself thrown. She treated each of them with that charming courtesy with which well-bred people treat their inferiors and was continually, to make herself useful, pushing back her chair so as to leave more room, holding my gloves, offering me all those services which would demean the proud spirit of a commoner but are very willingly rendered by sovereign ladies or, instinctively and by force of professional habit, by retired servants\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But already the Duke, who seemed in a hurry to complete the round of introduction, had led me off to another of the flower-maidens. On hearing her name I told her that I had passed by her country house, not far from Balbec. \u201cOh, I should have been so pleased to take you over it,\u201d she informed me, almost in a whisper, to enhance her modesty, but in a tone of deep feeling, steeped in regret for the loss of an opportunity to enjoy a quite exceptional pleasure; and went on, with a meaning glance: \u201cI do hope you will come again some day. But I must say that what would interest you more still would be my aunt Brancas\u2019s place. It was built by Mansard; it is the jewel of the province.\u201d It was not only she herself who would have been glad to shew me over her house, but her aunt Brancas would have been no less delighted to do me the honours of hers, or so I was assured by this lady who thought evidently that, especially at a time when the land shewed a tendency to pass into the hands of financiers who had no knowledge of the world, it was important that the great should keep up the exalted traditions of lordly hospitality, by speeches which involved them in nothing. It was also because she sought, like everyone in her world, to say the things which would give most pleasure to the person she was addressing, to give him the highest idea of himself, to make him think that he flattered people by writing to them, that he honoured those who entertained him, that everyone was burning to know him. The desire to give other people this comforting idea of themselves does, it must be admitted, exist even among the middle classes. We find there that kindly disposition, in the form of an individual merit compensating for some other defect, not alas among the most trusty male friends but at any rate among the most agreeable female companions. But there anyhow it blooms only in isolated patches. In an important section of the aristocracy, on the other hand, this characteristic has ceased to be individual; cultivated by education, sustained by the idea of a personal greatness which can fear no humiliation, which knows no rival, is aware that by being pleasant it can make people happy and delights in doing so, it has become the generic feature of a class. And even those whom personal defects of too incompatible a kind prevent from keeping it in their hearts bear the unconscious trace of it in their vocabulary or their gesticulation\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cShe is a very good creature,\u201d said the Duc de Guermantes, of the Princesse de Parme, \u201cand she can play the \u2018great lady\u2019 when she likes, better than anyone.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While I was being introduced to the ladies, one of the gentlemen of the party had been shewing various signs of agitation: this was Comte Hannibal de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9-Consalvi. Arriving late, he had not had time to investigate the composition of the party, and when I entered the room, seeing in me a guest who was not one of the Duchess\u2019s regular circle and must therefore have some quite extraordinary claim to admission, installed his monocle beneath the groined arch of his eyebrow, thinking that this would be a great help to him in discovering what manner of man I was. He knew that Mme. de Guermantes possessed (the priceless appanage of truly superior women) what was called a \u2018salon,\u2019 that is to say added occasionally to the people of her own set some celebrity who had recently come into prominence by the discovery of a new cure for something or the production of a masterpiece. The Faubourg Saint-Germain had not yet recovered from the shock of learning that, to the reception which she had given to meet the King and Queen of England, the Duchess had not been afraid to invite M. D\u00e9taille. The clever women of the Faubourg who had not been invited were inconsolable, so deliciously thrilling would it have been to come into contact with that strange genius. Mme. de Courvoisier made out that M. Ribot had been there as well, but this was a pure invention, designed to make people believe that Oriane was aiming at an Embassy for her husband. Finally, a last straw of scandal, M. de Guermantes, with a gallantry that would have done credit to Marshal Saxe, had repaired to the green-room of the Com\u00e9die Fran\u00e7aise, and had begged Mlle. Reichemberg to come and recite before the King, which having come to pass constituted an event without precedent in the annals of routs. Remembering all these surprises, which, moreover, had his entire approval, his own presence being not merely an ornament but, in the same way as that of the Duchesse de Guermantes, a consecration to any drawing-room, M. de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9, when he asked himself who I could be, felt that the field of exploration was very wide. For a moment the name of M. Widor flashed before his mind, but he decided that I was not old enough to be an organist, and M. Widor not striking enough to be \u2018asked out.\u2019 It seemed on the whole more plausible to regard me simply as the new Attach\u00e9 at the Swedish Legation of whom he had heard, and he was preparing to ask me for the latest news of Oscar, by whom he had several times been very hospitably received; but when the Duke, in introducing me, had mentioned my name to M. de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9, the latter, finding that name to be completely unknown to him had no longer any doubt that, being where I was, I must be a celebrity Of some sort. Oriane would certainly never invite anyone who was not, and had the art of attracting men who were in the public eye to her house, in a ratio that of course never exceeded one per cent, otherwise she would have lowered its tone. M. de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9 began, therefore, to lick his chops and to sniff the air greedily, his appetite whetted not only by the good dinner upon which he could count, but by the character of the party, which my presence could not fail to make interesting, and which would furnish him with a topic for brilliant conversation next day at the Duc de Chartres\u2019s luncheon-table. He had not yet settled in his own mind whether I was the man who had just been making those experiments with a serum to cure cancer, or the author of the new \u2018curtain-raiser\u2019 then in rehearsal at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Fran\u00e7ais; but, a great intellectual, a great collector of \u2018travellers\u2019 tales,\u2019 he continued an ever increasing display of reverences, signs of mutual understanding, smiles filtered through the glass of his monocle; either in the mistaken idea that a man of my standing would esteem him more highly if he could manage to instil into me the illusion that for him, the Comte de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9-Consalvi, the privileges of the mind were no less deserving of respect than those of birth; or simply from the need to express and difficulty of expressing his satisfaction, in his ignorance of the language in which he ought to address me, just as if, in fact, he had found himself face to face with one of the \u2018natives\u2019 of an undiscovered country on which his keel had grounded, natives from whom, in the hope of ultimate profit, he would endeavour, observing with interest the while their quaint customs and without interrupting his demonstrations of friendship, or like them uttering loud cries, to obtain ostrich eggs and spices in exchange for his glass beads. Having responded as best I could to his joy, I shook hands next with the Duc de Chatellerault, whom I had already met at Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s, who, he informed me, was as \u2018cunning as they made \u2019em.\u2019 He was typically Guermantes in the fairness of his hair, his arched profile, the points where the skin of his cheeks lost colour, all of which may be seen in the portraits of that family which have come down to us from the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. But, as I was no longer in love with the Duchess, her reincarnation in the person of a young man offered me no attraction. I interpreted the hook made by the Duc de Chatellerault\u2019s nose, as if it had been the signature of a painter whose work I had long studied but who no longer interested me in the least. Next, I said good evening also to the Prince de Foix, and to the detriment of my knuckles, which emerged crushed and mangled, let them be caught in a vice which was the German handclasp, accompanied by an ironical or good-natured smile, of the Prince von Faffenheim, M. de Norpois\u2019s friend, who, by virtue of the mania for nicknames which prevailed in this set, was known so universally as Prince Von that he himself used to sign his letters \u2018Prince Von,\u2019 or, when he wrote to his intimates, \u2018Von.\u2019 And yet this abbreviation was understandable, in view of his triple-barrelled name. It was less easy to grasp the reasons which made \u2018Elizabeth\u2019 be replaced, now by \u2018Lili,\u2019 now by \u2018Bebeth,\u2019 just as another world swarmed with \u2018Kikis.\u2019 One can realise that these people, albeit in most respects idle and light-minded enough, might have come to adopt \u2018Quiou\u2019 in order not to waste the precious time that it would have taken them to pronounce \u2018Montesquieu.\u2019 But it is not so easy to see what they saved by naming one of their cousins \u2018Dinand\u2019 instead of \u2018Ferdinand.\u2019 It must not be thought, however, that in the invention of nicknames the Guermantes invariably proceed to curtail or reduplicate syllables. Thus two sisters, the Comtesse de Montpeyroux and the Vicomtesse de V\u00e9lude, who were both of them enormously stout, invariably heard themselves addressed, without the least trace of annoyance on their part or of amusement on other people\u2019s, so long established was the custom, as \u2018Petite\u2019 and \u2018Mignonne.\u2019 Mme. de Guermantes, who adored Mme. de Montpeyroux, would, if her friend had been seriously ill, have flown to the sister with tears in her eyes and exclaimed: \u201cI hear Petite is dreadfully bad!\u201d Mme. de l\u2019Eclin, who wore her hair in bands that entirely hid her ears, was never called anything but \u2018The Empty Stomach\u2019; in some cases people simply added an \u2018a\u2019 to the last or first name of the husband to indicate the wife. The most miserly, most sordid, most inhuman man in the Faubourg having been christened Raphael, his charmer, his flower springing also from the rock always signed herself \u2018Raphaela\u2019\u2014 but these are merely a few specimens taken from innumerable rules, to which we can always return later on, if the occasion offers, and explain some of them. I then asked the Duke to present me to the Prince d\u2019Agrigente. \u201cWhat! Do you mean to say you don\u2019t know our excellent Gri-gri!\u201d cried M. de Guermantes, and gave M. d\u2019Agrigente my name. His own, so often quoted by Fran\u00e7oise, had always appeared to me like a transparent sheet of coloured glass through which I beheld, struck, on the shore of the violet sea, by the slanting rays of a golden sun, the rosy marble cubes of an ancient city of which I had not the least doubt that the Prince \u2014 happening for a miraculous moment to be passing through Paris \u2014 was himself, as luminously Sicilian and gloriously mellowed, the absolute sovereign. Alas, the vulgar drone to whom I was introduced, and who wheeled round to bid me good evening with a ponderous ease which he considered elegant, was as independent of his name as of any work of art that he might have owned without bearing upon his person any trace of its beauty, without, perhaps, ever having stopped to examine it. The Prince d\u2019Agrigente was so entirely devoid of anything princely, anything that might make one think of Girgenti that one was led to suppose that his name, entirely distinct from himself, bound by no ties to his person, had had the power of attracting to itself the whole of whatever vague poetical element there might have been in this man as in any other, and isolating it, after the operation, in the enchanted syllables. If any such operation had been performed, it had certainly been done most efficiently, for there remained not an atom of charm to be drawn from this kinsman of Guermantes. With the result that he found himself at one and the same time the only man in the world who was Prince d\u2019Agrigente and the man who, of all the men in the world was, perhaps, least so. He was, for all that, very glad to be what he was, but as a banker is glad to hold a number of shares in a mine without caring whether the said mine answers to the charming name of Ivanhoe or Primrose, or is called merely the Premier. Meanwhile, as these introductions, which it has taken me so long to recount but which, beginning as I entered the room, had lasted only a few seconds, were coming to an end, and Mme. de Guermantes, in an almost suppliant tone, was saying to me: \u201cI am sure Basin is tiring you, dragging you round like that; we are anxious for you to know our friends, but we are a great deal more anxious not to tire you, so that you may come again often,\u201d the Duke, with a somewhat awkward and timid wave of the hand, gave (as he would gladly have given it at any time during the last hour, filled for me by the contemplation of his Elstirs) the signal that dinner might now be served\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I should add that one of the guests was still missing, M. de Grouchy, whose wife, a Guermantes by birth, had arrived by herself, her husband being due to come straight from the country, where he had been shooting all day. This M. de Grouchy, a descendant of his namesake of the First Empire, of whom it has been said, quite wrongly, that his absence at the start of the Battle of Waterloo was the principal cause of Napoleon\u2019s defeat, came of an excellent family which, however, was not good enough in the eyes of certain fanatics for blue blood. Thus the Prince de Guermantes, whose own tastes, in later life, were to prove more easily satisfied, had been in the habit of saying to his nieces: \u201cWhat a misfortune for that poor Mme. de Guermantes\u201d (the Vicomtesse de Guermantes, Mme. de Grouchy\u2019s mother) \u201cthat she has never succeeded in marrying any of her children.\u201d \u201cBut, uncle, the eldest girl married M. de Grouchy.\u201d \u201cI do not call that a husband! However, they say that your uncle Fran\u00e7ois has proposed for the youngest one, so perhaps they won\u2019t all die old maids.\u201d No sooner was the order to serve dinner given than with a vast gyratory whirr, multiple and simultaneous, the double doors of the dining-room swung apart; a chamberlain with the air of a Lord Chamberlain bowed before the Princesse de Parme and announced the tidings \u201cMadame is served,\u201d in a tone such as he would have employed to say \u201cMadame is dead,\u201d which, however, cast no gloom over the assembly for it was with an air of unrestrained gaiety and as, in summer, at \u2018Robinson\u2019 that the couples moved forward one behind another to the dining-room, separating when they had reached their places where footmen thrust their chairs in behind them; last of all, Mme. de Guermantes advanced upon me, that I might lead her to the table, and without my feeling the least shadow of the timidity that I might have feared, for, like a huntress to whom her great muscular prowess has made graceful motion an easy thing, observing no doubt that I had placed myself on the wrong side of her, she pivoted with such accuracy round me that I found her arm resting on mine and attuned in the most natural way to a rhythm of precise and noble movements. I yielded to these with all the more readiness in that the Guermantes attached no more importance to them than does to learning a truly learned man in whose company one is less alarmed than in that of a dunce; other doors opened through which there entered the steaming soup, as though the dinner were being held in a puppet-theatre of skilful mechanism where the belated arrival of the young guest set, on a signal from the puppet-master, all the machinery in motion\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Timid and not majestically sovereign had been this signal from the Duke, to which had responded the unlocking of that vast, ingenious, subservient and sumptuous clockwork, mechanical and human. The indecision of his gesture did not spoil for me the effect of the spectacle that was attendant upon it. For I could feel that what had made it hesitating and embarrassed was the fear of letting me see that they were waiting only for myself to begin dinner and that they had been waiting for some time, just as Mme. de Guermantes was afraid that after looking at so many pictures I would find it tiring and would be hindered from taking my ease among them if her husband engaged me in a continuous flow of introductions. So that it was the absence of grandeur in this gesture that disclosed its true grandeur. As, also, did that indifference shewn by the Duke to the splendour of his surroundings, in contrast to his deference towards a guest, however insignificant, whom he desired to honour\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Not that M. de Guermantes was not in certain respects thoroughly commonplace, shewing indeed some of the absurd weaknesses of a man with too much money, the arrogance of an upstart, which he certainly was not. But just as a public official or a priest sees his own humble talents multiplied to infinity (as a wave is by the whole mass of the sea which presses behind it) by those forces on which they can rely, the Government of France and the Catholic Church, so M. de Guermantes was borne on by that other force, aristocratic courtesy in its truest form. This courtesy drew the line at any number of people. Mme. de Guermantes would not have asked to her house Mme. de Cambremer, or M. de Forcheville. But the moment that anyone (as was the case with me) appeared eligible for admission into the Guermantes world, this courtesy revealed treasures of hospitable simplicity more splendid still, were that possible, than those historic rooms, or the marvellous furniture that had remained in them\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When he wished to give pleasure to anyone, M. de Guermantes possessed, in this way, for making his guest for the moment the principal person present, an art which made the most of the circumstances and the place. No doubt at Guermantes his \u2018distinctions\u2019 and \u2018favours\u2019 would have assumed another form. He would have ordered his carriage to take me for a drive, alone with himself, before dinner. Such as they were, one could not help feeling touched by his manners as one is in reading memoirs of the period by those of Louis XIV when he replies good-naturedly, smiling and almost with a bow, to some one who has come to solicit his favour. It must however in both instances be borne in mind that this \u2018politeness\u2019 did not go beyond the strict meaning of the word\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Louis XIV (with whom the sticklers for pure nobility of his day find fault, nevertheless, for his scant regard for etiquette, so much so that, according to Saint-Simon, he was only a very minor king, as kings go, when compared with such monarchs as Philippe de Valois or Charles V), has the most minute instructions drawn up so that Princes of the Blood and Ambassadors may know to what sovereigns they ought to give precedence. In certain cases, in view of the impossibility of arriving at a decision a compromise is arranged by which the son of Louis XIV, Monseigneur, shall entertain certain foreign sovereigns only out of doors, in the open air, so that it may not be said that in entering the house one has preceded the other; and the Elector Palatine, entertaining the Duc de Chevreuse at dinner, pretends, so as not to have to make way for his guest, to be taken ill, and dines with him indeed, but dines lying down, thus avoiding the difficulty. M. le Duc evading opportunities of paying his duty to Monsieur the latter, on the advice of the King, his brother, who is moreover extremely attached to him, seizes an excuse for making his cousin attend his levee and forcing him to pass him his shirt. But as soon as the feeling is deep, when the heart is involved, this rule of duty, so inflexible when politeness only is at stake, changes entirely. A few hours after the death of his brother, one of the people whom he most dearly loved, when Monsieur, in the words of the Duc de Montfort, is \u2018still warm,\u2019 we find Louis XIV singing snatches from operas, astonished that the Duchesse de Bourgogne, who has difficulty in concealing her grief, should be looking so woe-begone, and, desiring that the gaiety of the court shall be at once resumed, so that his courtiers may be encouraged to sit down to the tables, ordering the Duc de Bourgogne to start a game of brelan. Well, not only in his social and concentrated activities, but in the most spontaneous utterances, the ordinary preoccupations of M. de Guermantes, the use he made of his time, one found a similar contrast; the Guermantes were no more susceptible than other mortals to grief; one might indeed say that their actual sensibility was lower; on the other hand one saw their names every day in the social columns of the Gaulois on account of the prodigious number of funerals at which they would have felt it a neglect of duty not to have their presence recorded. As the traveller discovers, almost unaltered, the houses roofed with turf, the terraces which may have met the eyes of Xenophon or Saint Paul, so in the manners of M. de Guermantes, a man who melted one\u2019s heart by his courtesy and revolted it by his harshness, I found still intact after the lapse of more than two centuries that deviation typical of court life under Louis XIV which transfers all scruples of conscience from matters of the affections and morality and applies them to purely formal questions\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The other reason for the friendliness shewn me by the Princesse de Parme was of a more personal kind. It was that she was convinced beforehand that everything that she saw at the Duchesse de Guermantes\u2019s, people and things alike, was of a quality superior to that of anything that she had at home. It is true that in all the other houses of her acquaintance she behaved as if this had been the case; over the simplest dish, the most ordinary flowers, she was not satisfied with going into ecstasies, she would ask leave to send round next morning, to copy the recipe or to examine the variety of blossom, her head cook or head gardener, gentlemen with large salaries who kept their own carriages and were deeply humiliated at having to come to inquire after a dish they despised or to take notes of a kind of carnation that was not half so fine, had not such ornamental streaks, did not produce so large a blossom as those which they had long been growing for her at home. But if in the Princess, wherever she went, this astonishment at the sight of the most commonplace things was assumed, and intended to shew that she did not derive from the superiority of her rank and riches a pride forbidden by her early instructors, habitually dissembled by her mother and intolerable in the sight of her Creator, it was, on the other hand, in all sincerity that she regarded the drawing-room of the Duchesse de Guermantes as a privileged place in which she could pass only from surprise to delight. To a certain extent, for that matter, though not nearly enough to justify this state of mind, the Guermantes were different from the rest of noble society, they were rarer and more refined. They had given me at first sight the opposite impression; I had found them vulgar, similar to all other men and women, but because before meeting them I had seen in them, as in Balbec, in Florence, in Parma, only names. Evidently, in this drawing-room, all the women whom I had imagined as being like porcelain figures were even more like the great majority of women. But, in the same way as Balbec or Florence, the Guermantes, after first disappointing the imagination because they resembled their fellow-creatures rather than their name, could subsequently, though to a less degree, appeal to the intellect by certain distinctive characteristics. Their bodily structure, the colour \u2014 a peculiar pink that merged at times into violet \u2014 of their skins, a certain almost flashing fairness of the finely spun hair, even in the men, on whom it was massed in soft golden tufts, half a wall-growing lichen, half a catlike fur (a luminous sparkle to which corresponded a certain brilliance of intellect, for if people spoke of the Guermantes complexion, the Guermantes hair, they spoke also of the wit of the Guermantes, as of the wit of the Mortemarts \u2014 a certain social quality whose superior fineness was famed even before the days of Louis XIV and all the more universally recognised since they published the fame of it themselves), all this meant that in the material itself, precious as that might be, in which one found them embedded here and there, the Guermantes remained recognisable, easy to detect and to follow, like the veins whose paleness streaks a block of jasper or onyx, or, better still, like the pliant waving of those tresses of light whose loosened hairs run like flexible rays along the sides of a moss-agate\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Guermantes \u2014 those at least who were worthy of the name \u2014 were not only of a quality of flesh, of hair, of transparency of gaze that was exquisite, but had a way of holding themselves, of walking, of bowing, of looking at one before they shook one\u2019s hand, of shaking hands, which made them as different in all these respects from an ordinary person in society as he in turn was from a peasant in a smock. And despite their friendliness one asked oneself: \u201cHave they not indeed the right, though they waive it, when they see us walk, bow, leave a room, do any of those things which when performed by them become as graceful as the flight of a swallow or the bending of a rose on its stem, to think: \u2018These people are of another race than ours, and we are, we, the true lords of creation.\u2019?\u201d Later on, I realised that the Guermantes did indeed regard me as being of another race, but one that aroused their envy because I possessed merits of which I knew nothing and which they professed to regard as alone important. Later still I came to feel that this profession of faith was only half sincere and that in them scorn or surprise could be coexistent with admiration and envy The physical flexibility essential to the Guermantes was twofold; thanks to one of its forms, constantly in action, at any moment and if, for example, a male Guermantes were about to salute a lady, he produced a silhouette of himself made from the unstable equilibrium of a series of asymmetrical movements with nervous compensations, one leg dragging a little either on purpose or because, having been broken so often in the hunting-field, it imparted to his trunk in its effort to keep pace with the other a deviation to which the upward thrust of one shoulder gave a counterpoise, while the monocle settled itself before his eye, raising an eyebrow just as the tuft of hair on the forehead was lowered in the formal bow; the other flexibility, like the form of the wave, the wind or the ocean track which is preserved on the shell or the vessel, was so to speak stereotyped in a sort of fixed mobility, curving the arched nose which, beneath the blue, protruding eyes, above the over-thin lips, from which, in the women, there emerged a raucous voice, recalled the fabulous origin attributed in the sixteenth century by the complaisance of parasitic and Hellenising genealogists to his race, ancient beyond dispute, but not to the degree of antiquity which they claimed when they gave as its source the mythological impregnation of a nymph by a divine Bird\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Guermantes were just as idiomatic from the intellectual as from the physical point of view. With the exception of Prince Gilbert (the husband with antiquated ideas of \u2018Marie-Gilbert,\u2019 who made his wife sit on his left when they drove out together because her blood, though royal, was inferior to his own)\u2014 but he was an exception and furnished, behind his back, a perpetual laughing-stock to the rest of the family, who had always fresh anecdotes to tell of him \u2014 the Guermantes, while living in the pure cream of aristocracy, affected to take no account of nobility. The theories of the Duchesse de Guermantes, who, to tell the truth, by dint of being a Guermantes, became to a certain extent something different and more attractive, subordinated everything else so completely to intellect, and were in politics so socialistic that one asked oneself where in her mansion could be hiding the familiar spirit whose duty it was to ensure the maintenance of the aristocratic standard of living, and which, always invisible but evidently crouching at one moment in the entrance hall, at another in the drawing-room, at a third in her dressing-room, reminded the servants of this woman who did not believe in titles to address her as Mme. la Duchesse, reminding also herself who cared only for reading and had no respect for persons to go out to dinner with her sister-in-law when eight o\u2019clock struck, and to put on a low gown\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The same familiar spirit represented to Mme. de Guermantes the social duties of duchesses, of the foremost among them, that was, who like herself were multi-millionaires, the sacrifice to boring tea, dinner and evening parties of hours in which she might have read interesting books, as unpleasant necessities like rain, which Mme. de Guermantes accepted, letting play on them her biting humour, but without seeking in any way to justify her acceptance of them. The curious accident by which the butler of Mme. de Guermantes invariably said \u201cMadame la Duchesse\u201d to this woman who believed only in the intellect did not however appear to shock her. Never had it entered her head to request him to address her simply as \u2018Madame.\u2019 Giving her the utmost benefit of the doubt one might have supposed that, thinking of something else at the time, she had heard only the word \u2018Madame\u2019 and that the suffix appended to it had not caught her attention. Only, though she might feign deafness, she was not dumb. In fact, whenever she had a message to give to her husband she would say to the butler: \u201cRemind Monsieur le Duc \u2014\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The familiar spirit had other occupations as well, one of which was to inspire them to talk morality. It is true that there were Guermantes who went in for intellect and Guermantes who went in for morals, and that these two classes did not as a rule coincide. But the former kind \u2014 including a Guermantes who had forged cheques, who cheated at cards and was the most delightful of them all, with a mind open to every new and sound idea \u2014 spoke even more eloquently upon morals than the others, and in the same strain as Mme. de Villeparisis, at the moments in which the familiar spirit expressed itself through the lips of the old lady. At corresponding moments one saw the Guermantes adopt suddenly a tone almost as old-ladylike, as genial and (as they themselves had more charm) more touching than that of the Marquise, to say of a servant: \u201cOne feels that she has a thoroughly sound nature, she\u2019s not at all a common girl, she must come of decent parents, she is certainly a girl who has never gone astray.\u201d At such moments the familiar spirit took the form of an intonation. But at times it could be bearing also, the expression on a face, the same in the Duchess as in her grandfather the Marshal, a sort of undefinable convulsion (like that of the Serpent, the genius of the Carthaginian family of Barca) by which my heart had more than once been set throbbing, on my morning walks, when before I had recognised Mme. de Guermantes I felt her eyes fastened upon me from the inside of a little dairy. This familiar spirit had intervened in a situation which was far from immaterial not merely to the Guermantes but to the Courvoisiers, the rival faction of the family and, though of as good blood as the Guermantes (it was, indeed, through his Courvoisier grandmother that the Guermantes explained the obsession which led the Prince de Guermantes always to speak of birth and titles as though those were the only things that mattered), their opposite in every respect. Not only did the Courvoisiers not assign to intelligence the same importance as the Guermantes, they had not the same idea of it. For a Guermantes (even were he a fool) to be intelligent meant to have a sharp tongue, to be capable of saying cutting things, to \u2018get away with it\u2019; but it meant also the capacity to hold one\u2019s own equally in painting, music, architecture, to speak English. The Courvoisiers had formed a less favourable impression of intelligence, and unless one were actually of their world being intelligent was almost tantamount to \u2018having probably murdered one\u2019s father and mother.\u2019 For them intelligence was the sort of burglar\u2019s jemmy by means of which people one did not know from Adam forced the doors of the most reputable drawing-rooms, and it was common knowledge among the Courvoisiers that you always had to pay in the long run for having \u2018those sort\u2019 of people in your house. To the most trivial statements made by intelligent people who were not \u2018in society\u2019 the Courvoisiers opposed a systematic distrust. Some one having on one occasion remarked: \u201cBut Swann is younger than Palam\u00e8de,\u201d\u2014\u201cHe says so, at any rate, and if he says it you may be sure it\u2019s because he thinks it is to his interest!\u201d had been Mme. de Gallardon\u2019s retort. Better still, when some one said of two highly distinguished foreigners whom the Guermantes had entertained that one of them had been sent in first because she was the elder: \u201cBut is she really the elder?\u201d Mme. de Gallardon had inquired, not positively as though that sort of person did not have any age but as if presumably devoid of civil or religious status, of definite traditions, they were both more or less young, like two kittens of the same litter between which only a veterinary surgeon was competent to decide. The Courvoisiers, more than the Guermantes, maintained also in a certain sense the integrity of the titled class thanks at once to the narrowness of their minds and the bitterness of their hearts. Just as the Guermantes (for whom, below the royal families and a few others like the Lignes, the La Tr\u00e9mo\u00eflles and so forth, all the rest were lost in a common rubbish-heap) were insolent towards various people of long descent who lived round Guermantes, simply because they paid no attention to those secondary distinctions by which the Courvoisiers were enormously impressed, so the absence of such distinctions affected them little. Certain women who did not hold any specially exalted rank in their native provinces but, brilliantly married, rich, good-looking, beloved of Duchesses, were for Paris, where people are never very well up in who one\u2019s \u2018father and mother\u2019 were, an excellent and exclusive piece of \u2018imported goods.\u2019 It might happen, though not commonly, that such women were, through the channel of the Princesse de Parme or by virtue of their own attractions, received by certain Guermantes. But with regard to these the indignation of the Courvoisiers knew no bounds. Having to meet, between five and six in the afternoon, at their cousin\u2019s, people with whose relatives their own relatives did not care to be seen mixing down in the Perche became for them an ever-increasing source of rage and an inexhaustible fount of rhetoric. The moment, for instance, when the charming Comtesse G\u2014\u2014-entered the Guermantes drawing-room, the face of Mme. de Villebon assumed exactly the expression that would have befitted it had she been called to recite the line:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And should but one stand fast, that one were surely I\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0a line which for that matter was unknown to her. This Courvoisier had consumed almost every Monday an \u00e9clair stuffed with cream within a few feet of the Comtesse G\u2014 \u2014 but to no consequence. And Mme. de Villebon confessed in secret that she could not conceive how her cousin Guermantes could allow a woman into her house who was not even in the second-best society of Ch\u00e2teaudun. \u201cI really fail to see why my cousin should make such a fuss about whom she knows; it\u2019s making a perfect farce of society!\u201d concluded Mme. de Villebon with a change of facial expression, this time a sly smile of despair, which, in a charade, would have been interpreted rather as indicating another line of poetry, though one with which she was no more familiar than with the first:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Gr\u00e2ce aux Dieux mon malheur passe mon esp\u00e9rance\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We may here anticipate events to explain that the pers\u00e9v\u00e9rance, (which rhymes, in the following line with esp\u00e9rance) shewn by Mme. de Villebon in snubbing Mme. G\u2014\u2014-was not entirely wasted. In the eyes of Mme. G\u2014\u2014\u2014 it invested Mme. de Villebon with a distinction so supreme, though purely imaginary, that when the time came for Mme. G\u2014\u2014-\u2018s daughter, who was the prettiest girl and the greatest heiress in the ballrooms of that season, to marry, people were astonished to see her refuse all the Dukes in succession. The fact was that her mother, remembering the weekly humiliations she had had to endure in the Rue de Grenelle on account of Chateaudun could think of only one possible husband for her daughter \u2014 a Villebon son\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A single point at which Guermantes and Courvoisiers converged was the art (one, for that matter, of infinite variety) of marking distances. The Guermantes manners were not absolutely uniform towards everyone. And yet, to take an example, all the Guermantes, all those who really were Guermantes, when you were introduced to them proceeded to perform a sort of ceremony almost as though the fact that they held out their hands to you had been as important as the conferring of an order of knighthood. At the moment when a Guermantes, were he no more than twenty, but treading already in the footsteps of his ancestors, heard your name uttered by the person who introduced you, he let fall on you as though he had by no means made up his mind to say \u201cHow d\u2019ye do?\u201d a gaze generally blue, always of the coldness of a steel blade which he seemed ready to plunge into the deepest recesses of your heart. Which was a matter of fact what the Guermantes imagined themselves to be doing, each of them regarding himself as a psychologist of the highest order. They thought moreover that they increased by this inspection the affability of the salute which was to follow it, and would not be rendered you without full knowledge of your deserts. All this occurred at a distance from yourself which, little enough had it been a question of a passage of arms, seemed immense for a handclasp, and had as chilling an effect in this connexion as in the other, so that when the Guermantes, after a rapid twisting thrust that explored the most intimate secrets of your soul and laid bare your title to honour, had deemed you worthy to associate with him thereafter, his hand, directed towards you at the end of an arm stretched out to its fullest extent, appeared to be presenting a rapier at you for a single combat, and that hand was in fact placed so far in advance of the Guermantes himself at that moment that when he afterwards bowed his head it was difficult to distinguish whether it was yourself or his own hand that he was saluting. Certain Guermantes, lacking the sense of proportion, or being incapable of refraining from repeating themselves incessantly, went further and repeated this ceremony afresh every time that they met you. Seeing that they had no longer any need to conduct the preliminary psychological investigation for which the \u2018familiar spirit\u2019 had delegated its powers to them and the result of which they had presumably kept in mind, the insistence of the perforating gaze preceding the handclasp could be explained only by the automatism which their gaze had acquired or by some power of fascination which they believed themselves to possess. The Courvoisiers whose physique was different, had tried in vain to assimilate that searching gaze and had had to fall back upon a lordly stiffness or a rapid indifference On the other hand, it was from the Courvoisiers that certain very exceptional Guermantes of the gentler sex seemed to have borrowed the feminine form of greeting. At the moment when you were presented to one of these she made you a sweeping bow in which she carried towards you, almost to an angle of forty-five degrees, her head and bust, the rest of her body (which came very high, up to the belt which formed a pivot) remaining stationary. But no sooner had she projected thus towards you the upper part of her person than she flung it backwards beyond the vertical line by a sudden retirement through almost the same angle. This subsequent withdrawal neutralised what appeared to have been conceded to you; the ground which you believed yourself to have gained did not even remain a conquest, as in a duel; the original positions were retained. This same annulment of affability by the resumption of distance (which was Courvoisier in origin and intended to shew that the advances made in the first movement were no more than a momentary feint) displayed itself equally clearly, in the Courvoisier ladies as in the Guermantes, in the letters which you received from them, at any rate in the first period of your acquaintance. The \u2018body\u2019 of the letter might contain sentences such as one writes only (you would suppose) to a friend, but in vain might you have thought yourself entitled to boast of being in that relation to the lady, since the letter began with \u2018Monsieur,\u2019 and ended with \u2018Croyez monsieur \u00e0 mes sentiments distingu\u00e9s.\u2019 After which, between this cold opening and frigid conclusion which altered the meaning of all the rest, there might come in succession (were it a reply to a letter of condolence from yourself) the most touching pictures of the grief which the Guermantes lady had felt on losing her sister, of the intimacy that had existed between them, of the beauty of the place in which she was staying, of the consolation that she found in the charm of her young children, all this amounted to no more than a letter such as one finds in printed collections, the intimate character of which implied, however, no more intimacy between yourself and the writer than if she had been the Younger Pliny or Mme. de Simiane\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is true that certain Guermantes ladies wrote to you from the first as \u2018My dear friend,\u2019 or \u2018My friends\u2019; these were not always the most simple natured among them, but rather those who, living only in the society of kings and being at the same time \u2018light,\u2019 assumed in their pride the certainty that everything which came from themselves gave pleasure and in their corruption the habit of setting no price upon any of the satisfactions that they had to offer. However, since to have had a common ancestor in the reign of Louis XIII was enough to make a young Guermantes say, in speaking of the Marquise de Guermantes: \u201cMy aunt Adam,\u201d the Guermantes were so numerous a clan that, even among these simple rites, that for example of the bow upon introduction to a stranger, there existed a wide divergence. Each subsection of any refinement had its own, which was handed down from parents to children like the prescription for a liniment or a special way of making jam. Thus it was that we saw Saint-Loup\u2019s handclasp thrust out as though involuntarily at the moment of his hearing one\u2019s name, without any participation by his eyes, without the addition of a bow. Any unfortunate commoner who for a particular reason \u2014 which, for that matter, very rarely occurred \u2014 was presented to anyone of the Saint-Loup subsection racked his brains over this abrupt minimum of a greeting, which deliberately assumed the appearance of non-recognition, to discover what in the world the Guermantes \u2014 male or female \u2014 could have against him. And he was highly surprised to learn that the said Guermantes had thought fit to write specially to the introducer to tell him how delighted he or she had been with the stranger, \u2022 whom he or she looked forward to meeting again. As specialised as the mechanical gestures of Saint-Loup were the complicated and rapid capers (which M. de Charlus condemned as ridiculous) of the Marquis de Fierbois, the grave and measured paces of the Prince de Guermantes. But it is impossible to describe here the richness of the choreography of the Guermantes ballet owing to the sheer length of the cast\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To return to the antipathy which animated the Courvoisiers against the Duchesse de Guermantes, they might have had the consolation of feeling sorry for her so long as she was still unmarried, for she was then comparatively poor. Unfortunately, at all times and seasons, a sort of fuliginous emanation, quite sut generis, enveloped, hid from the eye the wealth of the Courvoisiers which, however great it might be, remained obscure. In vain might a young Courvoisier with an ample dowry find a most eligible bridegroom; it invariably happened that the young couple had no house of their own in Paris, \u2018came up to stay\u2019 in the season with his parents, and for the rest of the year lived down in the country in the thick of a society that may have been unadulterated but was also quite undistinguished. Whereas a Saint-Loup who was up to the eyes in debt dazzled Donci\u00e8res with his carriage-horses, a Courvoisier who was extremely rich always went in the tram. Similarly (though of course many years earlier) Mlle, de Guermantes (Oriane), who had scarcely a penny to her name, created more stir with her clothes than all the Courvoisiers put together. The really scandalous things she said gave a sort of advertisement to her style of dressing and doing her hair. She had had the audacity to say to the Russian Grand Duke: \u201cWell, Sir, I hear you would like to have Tolstoy murdered?\u201d at a dinner-party to which none of the Courvoisiers, not that any of them knew very much about Tolstoy, had been asked. They knew little more about Greek writers, if we may judge by the Dowager Duchesse de Gallardon (mother-in-law of the Princesse de Gallardon who at that time was still a girl) who, not having been honoured by Oriane with a single visit in five years, replied to some one who asked her the reason for this abstention: \u201cIt seems she recites Aristotle\u201d (meaning Aristophanes) \u201cin society. I cannot allow that sort of thing in my house!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One can imagine how greatly this \u2018sally\u2019 by Mlle. de Guermantes upon Tolstoy, if it enraged the Courvoisiers, delighted the Guermantes, and by derivation everyone who was not merely closely but even remotely attached to them. The Dowager Comtesse d\u2019Argencourt (n\u00e9e Seineport) who entertained a little of everything, because she was a blue-stocking and in spite of her son\u2019s being a terrible snob, repeated the saying before her literary friends with the comment: \u201cOriane de Guermantes, you know; she\u2019s as fine as amber, as mischievous as a monkey, there\u2019s nothing she couldn\u2019t do if she chose, her water-colours are worthy of a great painter and she writes better verses than most of the great poets, and as for family, don\u2019t you know, you couldn\u2019t imagine anything better, her grandmother was Mlle, de Montpensier, and she is the eighteenth Oriane de Guermantes in succession, without a single misalliance; it\u2019s the purest blood, the oldest in the whole of France.\u201d And so the sham men of letters, those demi-intellectuals who went to Mme. d\u2019Argencourt\u2019s, forming a mental picture of Oriane de Guermantes, whom they would never have an opportunity to know personally, as something more wonderful and more extraordinary than Princess Badroulbadour, not only felt themselves ready to die for her on learning that so noble a person glorified Tolstoy above all others, but felt also quickening with a fresh strength in their minds their own love of Tolstoy, their longing to fight against Tsarism. These liberal ideas might have grown faint in them, they might have begun to doubt their importance, no longer venturing to confess to holding them, when suddenly from Mlle, de Guermantes herself, that is to say from a girl so indisputably cultured and authorised to speak, who wore her hair flat on her brow (a thing that no Courvoisier would ever have consented to do), came this vehement support. A certain number of realities, good or bad in themselves, gain enormously in this way by receiving the adhesion of people who are in authority over us. For instance among the Courvoisiers the rites of affability in a public thoroughfare consisted in a certain bow, very ugly and far from affable in itself but which people knew to be the distinguished way of bidding a person good day, with the result that everyone else, suppressing the instinctive smile of welcome on his own face, endeavoured to imitate these frigid gymnastics. But the Guermantes in general and Oriane in particular, while better conversant than anyone with these rites, did not hesitate, if they caught sight of you from a carriage, to greet you with a sprightly wave of the hand, and in a drawing-room, leaving the Courvoisiers to make their stiff and imitative bows, sketched charming reverences in the air, held out their hands as though to a comrade with a smile from their blue eyes, so that suddenly, thanks to the Guermantes, there entered into the substance of smartness, until then a little hollow and dry, everything that you would naturally have liked and had compelled yourself to forego, a genuine welcome, the effusion of a true friendliness, spontaneity. It is in a similar fashion (but by a rehabilitation which this time is scarcely justified) that people who carry in themselves an instinctive taste for bad music and for melodies, however commonplace, which have in them something easy and caressing, succeed, by dint of education in symphonic culture, in mortifying that appetite. But once they have arrived at this point, when, dazzled \u2014 and rightly so \u2014 by the brilliant orchestral colouring of Richard Strauss, they see that musician adopt with an indulgence worthy of Auber the most vulgar motifs, what those people originally admired finds suddenly in so high an authority a justification which delights them, and they let themselves be enchanted without scruple and with a twofold gratitude, when they listen to Salom\u00e9, by what it would have been impossible for them to admire in Les Diamants de la Couronne. Authentic or not, the retort made by Mlle, de Guermantes to the Grand Duke, retailed from house to house, furnished an opportunity to relate the excessive smartness with which Oriane had been turned out at the dinner-party in question. But if such splendour (and this is precisely what rendered it unattainable by the Courvoisiers) springs not from wealth but from prodigality, the latter does nevertheless last longer if it enjoys the constant support of the former, which allows it to spend all its fire. Given the principles openly advertised not. only by Oriane but by Mlle, de Villeparisis, namely that nobility does not count, that it is ridiculous to bother one\u2019s head about rank, that wealth does not necessarily mean happiness, that intellect, heart, talent are alone of importance, the Courvoisiers were justified in hoping that, as a result of the training she had received from the Marquise, Oriane would marry some one who was not in society, an artist, a fugitive from justice, a scallawag, a free-thinker, that she would pass definitely into the category of what the Courvoisiers called \u2018detrimentals.\u2019 They were all the more justified in this hope since, inasmuch as Mme. de Villeparisis was at this very moment, from the social point of view, passing through an awkward crisis (none of the few bright stars whom I was to meet in her drawing-room had as yet reappeared there), she professed an intense horror of the society which was thus holding her aloof. Even when she referred to her nephew the Prince de Guermantes, whom she did still see, she could never make an end of mocking at him because he was so infatuated about his pedigree. But the moment it became a question of finding a husband for Oriane, it had been no longer the principles publicly advertised by aunt and niece that had controlled the operations, it had been the mysterious \u2018familiar spirit\u2019 of their race. As unerringly as if Mme. de Villeparisis and Oriane had never spoken of anything but rent-rolls and pedigrees in place of literary merit and depth of character, and as if the Marquise, for the space of a few days, had been \u2014 as she would ultimately be \u2014 dead and on her bier, in the church of Combray, where each member of the family would be reduced to a mere Guermantes, with a forfeiture of individuality and baptismal names to which there testified on the voluminous black drapery of the pall the single \u2018G\u2019 in purple surmounted by the ducal coronet, it was on the wealthiest man and the most nobly born, on the most eligible bachelor of the Faubourg Saint-Germain, on the eldest son of the Duc de Guermantes, the Prince des Laumes, that the familiar spirit had let fall the choice of the intellectual, the critical, the evangelical Mme. de Villeparisis. And for a couple of hours, on the day of the wedding, Mme. de Villeparisis received in her drawing-room all the noble persons at whom she had been in the habit of sneering, at whom she indeed sneered still to the various plebeian intimates whom she had invited and on whom the Prince des Laumes promptly left cards, preparatory to \u2018cutting the cable\u2019 in the following year. And then, making the Courvoisiers\u2019 cup of bit terness overflow, the same old maxims, which made out intellect and talent to be the sole claims to social pre-eminence, resumed their doctrinal fore in the household of the Princesse des Laumes immediately after her mar riage. And in this respect, be it said in passing, the point of view which Saint-Loup upheld when he lived with Rachel, frequented the friends of Rachel, would have liked to marry Rachel, implied \u2014 whatever the horror that it inspired in the family \u2014 less falsehood than that of the Guermantes young ladies in general, preaching the virtues of intellect, barely admitting the possibility of anyone\u2019s questioning the equality of mankind, all of which ended at a given point in the same result as if they had professed the opposite principles, that is to say in marriage to an extremely wealthy duke. Saint-Loup did, on the contrary, act in conformity with his theories which led people to say that he was treading in evil ways. Certainly from the moral standpoint Rachel was not altogether satisfactory. But it is by no means certain whether, if she had been some person no more worthy but a duchess or the heiress to many millions, Mme. de Marsantes would not have been in favour of the match\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Well, to return to Mme. des Laumes (shortly afterwards Duchesse de Guermantes, on the death of her father-in-law), it was the last agonising straw upon the backs of the Courvoisiers that the theories of the young Princess, remaining thus lodged in her speech, should not in any sense be guiding her conduct; with the result that this philosophy (if one may so call it) in no way impaired the aristocratic smartness of the Guermantes drawing-room. No doubt all the people whom Mme. de Guermantes did not invite imagined that it was because they were not clever enough, and some rich American lady who had never had any book in her possession except a little old copy, never opened, of Parny\u2019s poems, arranged because it was of the \u2018period\u2019 upon one of the tables in her inner room, shewed how much importance she attached to the things of the mind by the devouring gaze which she fastened on the Duchesse de Guermantes when that lady made her appearance at the Opera. No doubt, also, Mme. de Guermantes was sincere when she selected a person on account of his or her intellect. When she said of a woman: \u201cIt appears, she\u2019s quite charming!\u201d or of a man that he was the \u201ccleverest person in the world,\u201d she imagined herself to have no other reason for consenting to receive them than this charm or cleverness, the familiar spirit not interposing itself at this last moment; more deeply rooted, stationed at the obscure entry of the region in which the Guermantes exercised their judgment, this vigilant spirit precluded them from finding the man clever or the woman charming if they had no social value, actual or potential. The man was pronounced learned, but like a dictionary, or, on the contrary, common, with the mind of a commercial traveller, the woman pretty, but with a terribly bad style, or too talkative. As for the people who had no definite position, they were simply dreadful \u2014 such snobs! M. de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9, whose country house was quite close to Guermantes, mixed with no one below the rank of Highness. But he laughed at them in his heart and longed only to spend his days in museums. Accordingly Mme. de Guermantes was indignant when anyone spoke of M. de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9 as a snob. \u201cA snob! Babal! But, my poor friend, you must be mad, it\u2019s just the opposite. He loathes smart people; he won\u2019t let himself be introduced to anyone. Even in my house! If I ask him to meet some one he doesn\u2019t know, he swears at me all the time.\u201d This was not to say that, even in practice, the Guermantes did not adopt an entirely different attitude towards cleverness from the Courvoisiers. In a positive sense, this difference between the Guermantes and the Courvoisiers had begun already to bear very promising fruit. Thus the Duchesse de Guermantes, enveloped moreover in a mystery which had set so many poets dreaming of her at a respectful distance, had given that party to which I have already referred, at which the King of England had enjoyed himself more thoroughly than anywhere else, for she had had the idea, which would never have occurred to a Courvoisier mind, of inviting, and the audacity, from which a Courvoisier courage would have recoiled, to invite, apart from the personages already mentioned, the musician Gaston Lemaire and the dramatist Grandmougin. But it was pre-eminently from the negative point of view that intellectuality made itself felt. If the necessary coefficient of cleverness and charm declined steadily as the rank of the person who sought an invitation from the Princesse des Laumes became more exalted, vanishing into zero when he or she was one of the principal Crowned Heads of Europe, conversely the farther they fell below this royal level the higher the coefficient rose. For instance at the Princesse de Parme\u2019s parties there were a number of people whom her Royal Highness invited because she had known them as children, or because they were related to some duchess, or attached to the person of some Sovereign, they themselves being quite possibly ugly, boring or stupid; well, with a Courvoisier any of the reasons: \u201ca favourite of the Princesse de Parme,\u201d \u201ca niece on the mother\u2019s side of the Duchesse d\u2019Arpajon,\u201d \u201cspends three months every year with the Queen of Spain,\u201d would have been sufficient to make her invite such people to her house, but Mme. de Guermantes, who had politely acknowledged their bows for ten years at the Princesse de Parme\u2019s, had never once allowed them to cross her threshold, considering that the same rule applied to a drawing-room in a social as in a material sense, where it only needed a few pieces of furniture which had no particular beauty but were left there to fill the room and as a sign of the owner\u2019s wealth, to render it hideous. Such a drawing-room resembled a book in which the author could not refrain from the use of language advertising his own learning, brilliance, fluency. Like a book, like a house, the quality of a \u2018salon,\u2019 thought Mme. de Guermantes \u2014 and rightly \u2014 is based on the corner-stone of sacrifice\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Many of the friends of the Princesse de Parme, with whom the Duchesse de Guermantes had confined herself for years past to the same conventional greeting, or to returning their cards, without ever inviting them to her parties or going to theirs, complained discreetly of these omissions to her Highness who, on days when M. de Guermantes came by himself to see her, passed on a hint to him. But the wily nobleman, a bad husband to the Duchess in so far as he kept mistresses, but her most tried and trusty friend in everything that concerned the good order of her drawing-room (and her own wit, which formed its chief attraction), replied: \u201cBut doe my wife know her? Indeed! Oh, well, I daresay she does. But the truth is, Ma\u2019am, that Oriane does not care for women\u2019s conversation. She lives surrounded by a court of superior minds \u2014 I am not her husband, I am only the first footman. Except for quite a small number, who are all of them very clever indeed, women bore her. Surely, Ma\u2019am, your Highness with all her fine judgment is not going to tell me that the Marquise de Souvr\u00e9 has any brains. Yes, I quite understand, the Princess receives her out of kindness. Besides, your Highness knows her. You tell me that Oriane has met her; it is quite possible, but once or twice at the most I assure you. And then, I must explain to your Highness, it is really a little my fault as well. My wife is very easily tired, and she is so anxious to be friendly always that if I allowed her she would never stop going to see people. Only yesterday evening she had a temperature, she was afraid of hurting the Duchesse de Bourbon\u2019s feelings by not going to see her. I had to shew my teeth, I assure you; I positively forbade them to bring the carriage round. Do you know, Ma\u2019am, I should really prefer not to mention to Oriane that you have spoken to me about Mme. de Souvr\u00e9. My wife is so devoted to your Highness, she will go round at once to invite Mme. de Souvr\u00e9 to the house; that will mean another call to be paid, it will oblige us to make friends with the sister, whose husband I know quite well. I think I shall say nothing at all about it to Oriane, if the Princess has no objection. That will save her a great deal of strain and excitement. And I assure you that it will be no loss to Mme. de Souvr\u00e9. She goes everywhere, moves in the most brilliant circles. You know, we don\u2019t entertain at all, really, just a few little friendly dinners, Mme. de Souvr\u00e9 would be bored to death.\u201d The Princesse de Parme, innocently convinced that the Duc de Guermantes would not transmit her request to his Duchess, and dismayed by her failure to procure the invitation that Mme. de Souvr\u00e9 sought, was all the more flattered to think that she herself was one of the regular frequenters of so exclusive a household. No doubt this satisfaction had its drawbacks also. Thus whenever the Princesse de Parme invited Mme. de Guermantes to her own parties she had to rack her brains to be sure that there was no one else on her list whose presence might offend the Duchess and make her refuse to come again\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On ordinary evenings (after dinner, at which she invariably entertained at a very early hour, for she clung to old customs, a small party) the drawing-room of the Princesse de Parme was thrown open to her regular guests, and, generally speaking, to all the higher ranks of the aristocracy, French and foreign. The order of her receptions was as follows: on issuing from the dining-room the Princess sat down on a sofa before a large round table and chatted with the two most important of the ladies who had dined with her, or else cast her eyes over a magazine, or sometimes played cards (or pretended to play, adopting a German court custom), either a game of patience by herself or selecting as her real or pretended partner some prominent personage. By nine o\u2019clock the double doors of the big drawing-room were in a state of perpetual agitation, opening and shutting and opening again to admit the visitors who had dined quietly at home (or if they had dined in town hurried from their caf\u00e9 promising to return later, since they intended only to go in at one door and out at the other) in order to conform with the Princess\u2019s time-table. She, meanwhile, her mind fixed on her game or conversation, made a show of not seeing the new arrivals, and it was not until they were actually within reach of her that she rose graciously from her seat, with a friendly smile for the women. The latter thereupon sank before the upright Presence in a courtesy which was tantamount to a genuflexion, so as to bring their lips down to the level of the beautiful hand which hung very low, and to kiss it. But at that moment the Princess, just as if she had been every time surprised by a formality with which nevertheless she was perfectly familiar, raised the kneeling figure as though by main force, and with incomparable grace and sweetness, and kissed her on both cheeks. A grace and sweetness that were conditional, you may say, upon the meekness with which the arriving guest inclined her knee. Very likely; and it seems that in a society without distinctions of rank politeness would vanish, not, as is generally supposed, from want of breeding, but because from one class would have vanished the deference due to a distinction which must be imaginary to be effective, and, more completely still, from the other class the affability in the distribution of which one is prodigal so long as one knows it to be, to the recipient, of an untold value which, in a world based on equality, would at once fall to nothing like everything that has only a promissory worth. But this disappearance of politeness in a reconstructed society is by no means certain, and we are at times too ready to believe that the present is the only possible state of things. People of first-rate intelligence have held the opinion that a Republic could not have any diplomacy or foreign alliances, and, more recently, that the peasant class would not tolerate the separation of Church and State. After all, the survival of politeness in a society levelled to uniformity would be no more miraculous than the practical success of the railway or the use of the aeroplane in war. Besides, even if politeness were to vanish, there is nothing to shew that this would be a misfortune. Lastly, would not society become secretly more hierarchical as it became outwardly more democratic? This seems highly probable. The political power of the Popes has grown enormously since they ceased to possess either States or an Army; our cathedrals meant far less to a devout Catholic of the seventeenth century than they mean to an atheist of the twentieth, and if the Princesse de Parme had been the sovereign ruler of a State, no doubt I should have felt myself impelled to speak of her almost as I should speak of a President of the Republic, that is to say not at all\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As soon as the postulant had been raised from the ground and embraced by the Princess, the latter resumed her seat and returned to her game of patience, but first of all, if the newcomer were of any importance, held her for a moment in conversation, making her sit down in an armchair\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When the room became too crowded the lady in waiting who had to control the traffic cleared the floor by leading the regular guests into an immense hall on to which the drawing-room opened, a hall filled with portraits and minor trophies of the House of Bourbon. The intimate friends of the Princess would then volunteer for the part of guide and would repeat interesting anecdotes, to which the young people had not the patience to listen, more interested in the spectacle of living Royalties (with the possibility of having themselves presented to them by the lady in waiting and the maids of honour) than in examining the relics of dead Sovereigns. Too much occupied with the acquaintances which they would be able to form and the invitations it might perhaps be possible to secure, they knew absolutely nothing, even in after-years, of what there was in this priceless museum of the archives of the Monarchy, and could only recall confusedly that it was decorated with cacti and giant palms which gave this centre of social elegance a look of the palmarium in the Jardin d\u2019Acclimatation\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Naturally the Duchesse de Guermantes, by way of self-mortification, did occasionally appear on these evenings to pay an \u2018after dinner\u2019 call on the Princess, who kept her all the time by her side, while she rallied the Duke. But on evenings when the Duchess came to dine, the Princess took care not to invite her regular party, and closed her doors to the world on rising from table, for fear lest a too liberal selection of guests might offend the exacting Duchess. On such evenings, were any of the faithful who had not received warning to present themselves on the royal doorstep, they would be informed by the porter: \u201cHer Royal Highness is not at home this evening,\u201d and would turn away. But, long before this, many of the Princess\u2019s friends had known that, on the day in question, they would not be asked to her house. These were a special set of parties, a privilege barred to so many who must have longed for admission. The excluded could, with a practical certainty, enumerate the roll of the elect, and would say irritably among themselves: \u201cYou know, of course, that Oriane de Guermantes never goes anywhere without her entire staff.\u201d With the help of this body the Princesse de Parme sought to surround the Duchess as with a protecting rampart against those persons the chance of whose making a good impression on her was at all doubtful. But with several of the Duchess\u2019s favourites, with several members of this glittering \u2018staff,\u2019 the Princesse de Parme resented having to go out of her way to shew them attentions, seeing that they paid little or no attention to herself. No doubt the Princess was fully prepared to admit that it was possible to derive more enjoyment in the company of the Duchesse de Guermantes than in her own. She could not deny that there was always a \u2018crush\u2019 on the Duchess\u2019s at-home days, or that she herself often met there three or four royal personages who thought it sufficient to leave their cards upon her. And in vain might she commit to memory Oriane\u2019s witty sayings, copy her gowns, serve at her own tea parties the same strawberry tarts, there were occasions on which she was left by herself all afternoon with a lady in waiting and some foreign Counsellor of Legation. And so whenever (as had been the case with Swann, for instance, at an earlier period) there was anyone who never let a day pass without going to spend an hour or two at the Duchess\u2019s and paid a call once in two years on the Princesse de Parme, the latter felt no great desire, even for the sake of amusing Oriane, to make to this Swann or whoever he was the \u2018advances\u2019 of an invitation to dinner. In a word, having the Duchess in her house was for the Princess a source of endless perplexity, so haunted was she by the fear that Oriane would find fault with everything. But in return, and for the same reason, when the Princesse de Parme came to dine with Mme. de Guermantes she could be certain beforehand that everything would be perfect, delightful, she had only one fear which was that of her own inability to understand, remember, give satisfaction, her inability to assimilate new ideas and people. On this account my presence aroused her attention and excited her cupidity, just as might a new way of decorating the dinner-table with festoons of fruit, uncertain as she was which of the two it might be \u2014 the table decorations or my presence \u2014 that was the more distinctively one of those charms, the secret of the success of Oriane\u2019s parties, and in her uncertainty firmly resolved to try at her own next dinner-party to introduce them both. What for that matter fully justified the enraptured curiosity which the Princesse de Parme brought to the Duchess\u2019s house was that element \u2014 amusing, dangerous, exciting \u2014 into which the Princess used to plunge with a combination of anxiety, shock and delight (as at the seaside on one of those days of \u2018big waves\u2019 of the danger of which the bathing-masters warn us, simply and solely because none of them knows how to swim), from which she used to emerge terrified, happy, rejuvenated, and which was known as the wit of the Guermantes. The wit of the Guermantes \u2014 a thing as non-existent as the squared circle, according to the Duchess who regarded herself as the sole Guermantes to possess it \u2014 was a family reputation like that of the pork pies of Tours or the biscuits of Rheims. No doubt (since an intellectual peculiarity does not employ for its perpetuation the same channels as a shade of hair or complexion) certain intimate friends of the Duchess who were not of her blood were nevertheless endowed with this wit, which on the other hand had failed to permeate the minds of various Guermantes, too refractory to assimilate wit of any kind. The holders, not related to the Duchess, of this Guermantes wit had generally the characteristic feature of having been brilliant men, fitted for a career to which, whether it were in the arts, diplomacy, parliamentary eloquence or the army, they had preferred the life of a small and intimate group. Possibly this preference could be explained by a certain want of originality, of initiative, of will power, of health or of luck, or possibly by snobbishness\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With certain people (though these, it must be admitted, were the exception) if the Guermantes drawing-room had been the stumbling-block in their careers, it had been without their knowledge. Thus a doctor, a painter and a diplomat of great promise had failed to achieve success in the careers for which they were nevertheless more brilliantly endowed than most of their competitors because their friendship with the Guermantes had the result that the two former were regarded as men of fashion and the third as a reactionary, which had prevented each of the three from winning the recognition of his colleagues. The mediaeval gown and red cap which are still donned by the electoral colleges of the Faculties are (or were at least, not so long since) something more than a purely outward survival from a narrow-minded past, from a rigid sectarianism. Under the cap with its golden tassels, like the High Priest in the conical mitre of the Jews, the \u2018Professors\u2019 were still, in the years that preceded the Dreyfus case, fast rooted in rigorously pharisaical ideas. Du Boulbon was at heart an artist, but was safe because he did not care for society. Cottard was always at the Verdurins\u2019. But Mme. Verdurin was a patient; besides, he was protected by his vulgarity; finally, at his own house he entertained no one outside the Faculty, at banquets over which there floated an aroma of carbolic. But in powerful corporations, where moreover the rigidity of their prejudices is but the price that must be paid for the noblest integrity, the most lofty conceptions of morality, which weaken in an atmosphere that, more tolerant, freer at first, becomes very soon dissolute, a Professor in his gown of scarlet satin faced with ermine, like that of a Doge (which is to say a Duke) of Venice enshrined in the Ducal Palace, was as virtuous, as deeply attached to noble principles, but as unsparing of any alien element as that other Duke, excellent but terrible, whom we know as M. de Saint-Simon. The alien, here, was the wordly doctor, with other manners, other social relations. To make good, the unfortunate of whom we are now speaking, so as not to be accused by his colleagues of looking down on them (the strange ideas of a man of fashion!) if he concealed from them his Duchesse de Guermantes, hoped to disarm them by giving mixed dinner-parties in which the medical element was merged in the fashionable. He was unaware that in so doing he signed his own death-warrant, or rather he discovered this later, when the Council of Ten had to fill a vacant chair, and it was invariably the name of another doctor, more normal, it might be obviously inferior, that leaped from the fatal urn, when their \u2018Veto\u2019 thundered from the ancient Faculty, as solemn, as absurd and as terrible as the \u2018Juro\u2019 that spelled the death of Moli\u00e8re. So too with the painter permanently labelled man of fashion, when fashionable people who dabbled in art had succeeded in making themselves be labelled artists; so with the diplomat who had too many reactionary associations\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But this case was the rarest of all. The type of distinguished man who formed the main substance of the Guermantes drawing-room was that of people who had voluntarily (or so at least they supposed) renounced all else, everything that was incompatible with the wit of the Guermantes, with the courtesy of the Guermantes, with that indefinable charm odious to any \u2018Corporation\u2019 however little centralised\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And the people who were aware that in days gone by one of these frequenters of the Duchess\u2019s drawing-room had been awarded the gold medal of the Salon, that another, Secretary to the Bar Council, had made a brilliant start in the Chamber, that a third had ably served France as Charg\u00e9 d\u2019Affaires, might have been led to regard as \u2018failures\u2019 people who had done nothing more now for twenty years. But there were few who were thus \u2018well-informed,\u2019 and the parties concerned would themselves have been the last to remind people, finding these old distinctions to be now valueless, in the light of this very Guermantes spirit of wit: for did not this condemn respectively as a bore or an usher, and as a counter-jumper a pair of eminent Ministers, one a trifle solemn, the other addicted to puns, of whose praises the newspapers were always full but in whose company Mme. de Guermantes would begin to yawn and shew signs of impatience if the imprudence of a hostess had placed either of them next to her at the dinner-table. Since being a statesman of the first rank was in no sense a recommendation to the Duchess\u2019s favour, those of her friends who had definitely abandoned the \u2018Career\u2019 or the \u2018Service,\u2019 who had never stood for the Chamber, felt, as they came day after day to have luncheon and talk with their great friend, or when they met her in the houses of Royal Personages, of whom for that matter they thought very little (or at least they said so), that they themselves had chosen the better part, albeit their melancholy air, even in the midst of the gaiety, seemed somehow to challenge the soundness of this opinion\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It must be recognised also that the refinement of social life, the subtlety of conversation at the Guermantes\u2019 did also contain, exiguous as it may have been, an element of reality. No official title was equivalent to the approval of certain chosen friends of Mme. de Guermantes, whom the most powerful Ministers had been unable to attract to their houses. If in this drawing-room so many intellectual ambitions, such noble efforts even had been for ever buried, still at least from their dust the rarest blossoms of civilised society had taken life. Certainly men of wit, Swann for instance, regarded themselves as superior to men of genuine worth, whom they despised, but that was because what the Duchesse de Guermantes valued above everything else was not intellect; it was, according to her, that superior, more exquisite form of the human intellect exalted to a verbal variety of talent \u2014 wit. And long ago at the Verdurins\u2019 when Swann condemned Brichot and Elstir, one as a pedant and the other as a clown, despite all the learning of one and the other\u2019s genius, it was the infiltration of the Guermantes spirit that had led him to classify them so. Never would he have dared to present either of them to the Duchess, conscious instinctively of the air with which she would have listened to Brichot\u2019s monologues and Elstir\u2019s hair-splittings, the Guermantes spirit regarding pretentious and prolix speech, whether in a serious or a farcical vein, as alike of the most intolerable imbecility\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As for the Guermantes of the true flesh and blood, if the Guermantes spirit had not absorbed them as completely as we see occur in, to take an example, those literary circles in which everyone shares a common way of pronouncing his words, of expressing his thoughts, and consequently of thinking, it was certainly not because originality is stronger in purely social groups or presents any obstacle there to imitation. But imitation depends not merely upon the absence of any unconquerable originality but also demands a relative fineness of ear which enables one first of all to discern what one is afterwards to imitate. Whereas there were several Guermantes in whom this musical sense was as entirely lacking as in the Courvoisiers\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To take as an instance what is called, in another sense of the word imitation, \u2018giving imitations\u2019 (or among the Guermantes was called \u2018taking off\u2019), Mme. de Guermantes might succeed in this to perfection, the Courvoisiers were as incapable of appreciating her as if they had been a tribe of rabbits instead of men and women, because they had never had the sense to observe the particular defect or accent that the Duchess was endeavouring to copy. When she \u2018gave an imitation\u2019 of the Duc de Limoges, the Courvoisiers would protest: \u201cOh, no, he doesn\u2019t really speak like that! I met him again only yesterday at dinner at Bebeth\u2019s; he talked to me all evening and he didn\u2019t speak like that at all!\u201d whereas the Guermantes of any degree of culture exclaimed: \u201cGad, what fun Oriane is! The odd part of it is that when she is copying him she looks exactly like him! I feel I\u2019m listening to him. Oriane, do give us a little more Limoges!\u201d Now these Guermantes (and not necessarily the few really outstanding members of the clan who when the Duchess imitated the Duc de Limoges, would say admiringly\u2019 \u201cOh, you really have got him,\u201d or \u201cYou do get him,\u201d) might indeed be del void of wit according to Mme. de Guermantes (and in this respect she was right); yet, by dint of hearing and repeating her sayings they had come to imitate more or less her way of expressing herself, of criticising people of what Swann, like the Duke himself, used to call her \u2018phrasing\u2019 of things so that they presented in their conversation something which to the Courvoisiers appeared \u2018fearfully like\u2019 Oriane\u2019s wit and was treated by them collectively as the \u2018wit of the Guermantes.\u2019 As these Guermantes were to her not merely kinsfolk but admirers, Oriane (who kept the rest of the family rigorously at arm\u2019s-length and now avenged by her disdain the insults that they had heaped upon her in her girlhood) went to call on them now and then, generally in company with the Duke, in the season, when she drove out with him. These visits were historic events. The heart began to beat more rapidly in the bosom of the Princesse d\u2019Epinay, who was \u2018at home\u2019 in her big drawing-room on the ground floor, when she perceived afar off, like the first glow of an innocuous fire, or the \u2018reconnaissances\u2019 of an unexpected invasion, making her way across the courtyard slowly, in a diagonal course, the Duchess crowned with a ravishing hat and holding atilt a sunshade from which there rained down a summer fragrance. \u201cWhy, here comes Oriane,\u201d she would say, like an \u2018On guard!\u2019 intended to convey a prudent warning to her visitors, so that they should have time to beat an orderly retreat, to clear the rooms without panic. Half of those present dared not remain, and rose at once to go. \u201cBut no, why? Sit down again, I insist on keeping you a little longer,\u201d said the Princess in a careless tone and seemingly at her ease (to shew herself the great lady) but in a voice that suddenly rang false. \u201cBut you may want to talk to each other.\u201d \u201cReally, you\u2019re in a hurry? Oh, very well, I shall come and see you,\u201d replied the lady of the house to those whom she was just as well pleased to see depart. The Duke and Duchess gave a very civil greeting to people whom they had seen there regularly for years, without for that reason coming to know them any better, while these in return barely said good day to them, thinking this more discreet. Scarcely had they left the room before the Duke began asking good-naturedly who they were, so as to appear to be taking an interest in the intrinsic quality of people whom he himself, owing to the cross-purposes of fate or the wretched state of Oriane\u2019s nerves, never saw in his own house. \u201cTell me, who was that little woman in the pink hat?\u201d \u201cWhy, my dear cousin, you have seen her hundreds of times, she\u2019s the Vicomtesse de Tours, who was a Lamarzelle.\u201d \u201cBut, do you know, she\u2019s quite good-looking; she seems clever too; if it weren\u2019t for a little flaw in her upper lip she\u2019d be a regular charmer. If there\u2019s a Vicomte de Tours, he can\u2019t have any too bad a time. Oriane, do you know what those eyebrows and the way her hair grows reminded me of? Your cousin Hedwige de Ligne.\u201d The Duchesse de Guermantes, who languished whenever people spoke of the beauty of any woman other than herself, let the conversation drop. She bad reckoned without the weakness her husband had for letting it be seen that he knew all about the people who did not come to his house, whereby be believed that he shewed himself to be more seriously minded than his wife. \u2018\u201cBut,\u201d he resumed suddenly with emphasis, \u201cyou mentioned the name Lamarzelle. I remember, when I was in the Chamber, hearing a really remarkable speech made . . . \u201d \u201cThat was the uncle of the young woman you saw just now.\u201d \u201cIndeed! What talent! No, my dear girl,\u201d he assured the Vicomtesse d\u2019Egremont, whom Mme. de Guermantes could not endure, but who, refusing to stir from the Princesse d\u2019Epinay\u2019s drawing-room where she willingly humbled herself to play the part of parlour-maid (and was ready to slap her own parlour-maid on returning home), stayed there, confused, tearful, but stayed when the ducal couple were in the room, took their cloaks, tried to make herself useful, offered discreetly to withdraw into the next room, \u201cyou are not to make tea for us, let us just sit and talk quietly, we are simple souls, really, honestly. Besides,\u201d he went on, turning to the Princesse d\u2019Epinay (leaving the Egremont lady blushing, humble, ambitious and full of zeal), \u201cwe can only give you a quarter of an hour.\u201d This quarter of an hour was entirely taken up with a sort of exhibition of the witty things which the Duchess had said during the previous week, and to which she herself would certainly not have referred had not her husband, with great adroitness, by appearing to be rebuking her with reference to the incidents that had provoked them, obliged her as though against her will to repeat them\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Princesse d\u2019Epinay, who was fond of her cousin and knew that she had a weakness for compliments, went into ecstasies over her hat, her sunshade, her wit. \u201cTalk to her as much as you like about her clothes,\u201d said the Duke in the sullen tone which he had adopted and now tempered with a sardonic smile so that his resentment should not be taken seriously, \u201cbut for heaven\u2019s sake don\u2019t speak of her wit, I should be only too glad not to have so witty a wife. You are probably alluding to the shocking pun she made about my brother Palam\u00e8de,\u201d he went on, knowing quite well that the Princess and the rest of the family had not yet heard this pun, and delighted to have an opportunity of shewing off his wife. \u201cIn the first place I consider it unworthy of a person who has occasionally, I must admit, said some quite good things, to make bad puns, but especially about my brother, who is very susceptible, and if it is going to lead to his quarrelling with me, that would really be too much of a good thing.\u201d \u201cBut we never heard a word about it! One of Oriane\u2019s puns! It\u2019s sure to be delicious. Oh, do tell us!\u201d \u201cNo, no,\u201d the Duke went on, still sulking though with a broader smile, \u201cI\u2019m so glad you haven\u2019t heard it. Seriously, I\u2019m very fond of my brother.\u201d \u201cListen, Basin,\u201d broke in the Duchess, the moment having come for her to take up her husband\u2019s cue, \u201cI can\u2019t think why you should say that it might annoy Palam\u00e8de, you know quite well it would do nothing of the sort. He is far too intelligent to be vexed by a stupid joke which has nothing offensive about it. You are making them think I said something nasty; I simply uttered a remark which was not in the least funny, it is you who make it seem important by losing your temper over it. I don\u2019t understand you.\u201d \u201cYou are making us terribly excited, what is it all about?\u201d \u201cOh, obviously nothing serious!\u201d cried M. de Guermantes. \u201cYou may have heard that my brother offered to give Br\u00e9z\u00e9, the place he got from his wife, to his sister Marsantes.\u201d \u201cYes, but we were told that she didn\u2019t want it, she didn\u2019t care for that part of the country, the climate didn\u2019t suit her.\u201d \u201cVery well, some one had been telling my wife all that and saying that if my brother was giving this place to our sister it was not so much to please her as to tease her. \u2018He\u2019s such a teaser, Charlus,\u2019 was what they actually said. Well, you know Br\u00e9z\u00e9, it\u2019s a royal domain, I should say it\u2019s worth millions, it used to be part of the crown lands, it includes one of the finest forests in the whole of France. There are plenty of people who would be only too delighted to be teased to that tune. And so when she heard the word \u2018teaser\u2019 applied to Charlus because he was giving away such a magnificent property, Oriane could not help exclaiming, without meaning anything, I must admit, there wasn\u2019t a trace of ill-nature about it, for it came like a flash of lightning: \u2018Teaser, teaser? Then he must be Teaser Augustus.\u2019 You understand,\u201d he went on, resuming his sulky tone, having first cast a sweeping glance round the room in order to judge the effect of his wife\u2019s witticism \u2014 and in some doubt as to the extent of Mme. d\u2019Epinay\u2019s acquaintance with ancient history, \u201cyou understand, it\u2019s an allusion to Augustus Caesar, the Roman Emperor; it\u2019s too stupid, a bad play on words, quite unworthy of Oriane. And then, you see, I am more circumspect than my wife, if I haven\u2019t her wit, I think of the consequences; if anyone should be so ill-advised as to repeat the remark to my brother there\u2019ll be the devil to pay. All the more,\u201d he went on, \u201cbecause as you know Palam\u00e8de is very high and mighty, and very fussy also, given to gossip and all that sort of thing, so that quite apart from the question of his giving away Br\u00e9z\u00e9 you must admit that \u2018Teaser Augustus\u2019 suits him down to the ground. That is what justifies my wife\u2019s remarks; even when she is inclined to stoop to what is almost vulgar, she is always witty and does really describe people.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And so, thanks on one occasion to \u2018Teaser Augustus,\u2019 on another to something else, the visits paid by the Duke and Duchess to their kinsfolk replenished the stock of anecdotes, and the emotion which these visits aroused lasted long after the departure of the sparkling lady and her \u2018producer.\u2019 Her hostess would begin by going over again with the privileged persons who had been at the entertainment (those who had remained in the room) the clever things that Oriane had said. \u201cYou hadn\u2019t heard \u2018Teaser Augustus\u2019?\u201d asked the Princesse d\u2019Epinay. \u201cYes,\u201d replied the Marquise de Baveno, blushing as she spoke, \u201cthe Princesse de Sarsina (the La Rochefoucauld one) mentioned it to me, not quite in the same words. But of course it was far more interesting to hear it repeated like that with my cousin in the room,\u201d she went on, as though speaking of a song that had been accompanied by the composer himself. \u201cWe were speaking of Oriane\u2019s latest \u2014 she was here just now,\u201d her hostess greeted a visitor who would be plunged in despair at not having arrived an hour earlier. \u201cWhat! Has Oriane been here?\u201d \u201cYes, you ought to have come a little sooner,\u201d the Princesse d\u2019Epinay informed her, not in reproach but letting her understand all that her clumsiness had made her miss. It was her fault alone if she had not been present at the Creation of the World or at Mme. Carvalho\u2019s last performance. \u201cWhat do you think of Oriane\u2019s latest? I must say, I do enjoy \u2018Teaser Augustus\u2019,\u201d and the \u2018saying\u2019 would be served up again cold next day at luncheon before a few intimate friends who were invited on purpose, and would reappear under various sauces throughout the week. Indeed the Princess happening in the course of that week to pay her annual visit to the Princesse de Parme seized the opportunity to ask whether her Royal Highness had heard the pun, and repeated it to her. \u201cAh! Teaser Augustus,\u201d said the Princesse de Parme, her eyes bulging with an instinctive admiration, which begged however for a complementary elucidation which Mme. d\u2019Epinay was not loath to furnish. \u201cI must say, \u2018Teaser Augustus\u2019 pleases me enormously as a piece of \u2018phrasing\u2019,\u201d she concluded. As a matter of fact the word \u2018phrasing\u2019 was not in the least applicable to this pun, but the Princesse d\u2019Epinay, who claimed to have assimilated her share of the Guermantes spirit, had borrowed from Oriane the expressions \u2018phrased\u2019 and \u2018phrasing\u2019 and employed them without much discrimination. New the Princesse de Parme, who was not at all fond of Mme. d\u2019Epinay, whom she considered plain, knew to be miserly and believed, on the authority of the Courvoisiers, to be malicious, recognised this word \u2018phrasing\u2019 which she had heard used by Mme. de Guermantes but would not by herself have known how or when to apply. She received the impression that it was in fact its \u2018phrasing\u2019 that formed the charm of \u2018Teaser Augustus\u2019 and, without altogether forgetting her antipathy towards the plain and miserly lady, could not repress a burst of admiration for a person endowed to such a degree with the Guermantes spirit, so strong that she was on the point of inviting the Princesse d\u2019Epinay to the Opera. She was held in check only by the reflexion that it would be wiser perhaps to consult Mme. de Guermantes first. As for Mme. d\u2019Epinay, who, unlike the Courvoisiers, paid endless attentions to Oriane and was genuinely fond of her but was jealous of her exalted friends and slightly irritated by the fun which the Duchess used to make of her before everyone on account of her meanness, she reported on her return home what an effort it had required to make the Princesse de Parme grasp the point of \u2018Teaser Augustus,\u2019 and declared what a snob Oriane must be to number such a goose among her friends. \u201cI should never have been able to see much of the Princesse de Parme even if I had cared to,\u201d she informed the friends who were dining with her. \u201cM. d\u2019Epinay would not have allowed it for a moment, because of her immorality,\u201d she explained, alluding to certain purely imaginary excesses on the part of the Princess. \u201cBut even if I had had a husband less strict in his views, I must say I could never have made friends with her. I don\u2019t know how Oriane can bear to see her every other day, as she does. I go there once a year, and it\u2019s all I can do to sit out my call.\u201d As for those of the Courvoisiers who happened to be at Victurnienne\u2019s on the day of Mme. de Guermantes\u2019s visit, the arrival of the Duchess generally put them to flight owing to the exasperation they felt at the \u2018ridiculous salaams\u2019 that were made to her there. One alone remained on the afternoon of \u2018Teaser Augustus.\u2019 He did not entirely see the point, but he did see part of it, being an educated man. And the Courvoisiers went about repeating that Oriane had called uncle Palarned \u2018Caesar Augustus,\u2019 which was, according to them, a good enough descrin tion of him, but why all this endless talk about Oriane, they went on People couldn\u2019t make more fuss about a queen. \u201cAfter all, what is Oriane? I don\u2019t say that the Guermantes aren\u2019t an old family, but the Courvoisiers are every bit as good in rank, antiquity, marriages. We mustn\u2019t forget that on the Field of the Cloth of Gold, when the King of England asked Fran\u00e7ois I who was the noblest of the lords there present, \u2018Sire,\u2019 said the King of France, \u2018Courvoisier.\u2019\u201d But even if all the Courvoisiers had stayed in the room to hear them, Oriane\u2019s sayings would have fallen on deaf ears, since the incidents that usually gave occasion for those sayings would have been regarded by them from a totally different point of view. If, for instance, a Courvoisier found herself running short of chairs, in the middle of a party, or if she used the wrong name in greeting a guest whose face she did not remember, or if one of her servants said something stupid, the Courvoisier, extremely annoyed, flushed, quivering with excitement, would deplore so unfortunate an occurrence. And when she had a visitor in the room and Oriane was expected, she would say in a tone anxiously and imperiously questioning: \u201cDo you know her?\u201d, fearing that if the visitor did not know her his presence might make an unfortunate impression on Oriane. But Mme. de Guermantes on the contrary extracted from such incidents opportunities for stories which made the Guermantes laugh until the tears streamed down their cheeks, so that one was obliged to envy her her having run short of chairs, having herself made or having allowed her servant to make a blunder, having had at her party some one whom nobody knew, as one is obliged to be thankful that great writers have been kept at a distance by men and betrayed by women when their humiliations and their sufferings have been if not the direct stimulus of their genius, at any rate the subject matter of their works\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Courvoisiers were incapable of rising to the level of the spirit of innovation which the Duchesse de Guermantes introduced into the life of society and, by adapting it, following an unerring instinct, to the necessities of the moment, made into something artistic where the purely rational application of cut and dried rules would have given as unfortunate results as would greet a man who, anxious to succeed in love or in politics, was to reproduce in his own daily life the exploits of Bussy d\u2019Amboise. If the Courvoisiers gave a family dinner or a dinner to meet some prince, the addition of a recognised wit, of some friend of their son seemed to them an anomaly capable of producing the direst consequences. A Courvoisier whose father had been a Minister of the Empire having to give an afternoon party to meet Princesse Mathilde deduced by a geometrical formula that she could invite no one but Bonapartists. Of whom she knew practically none. All the smart women of her acquaintance, all the amusing men were ruthlessly barred because, from their Legitimist views or connexions, they might easily, according to Courvoisier logic, give offence to the Imperial Highness. The latter, who in her own house entertained the flower of the Faubourg Saint-Germain, was quite surprised when she found at Mme. de Courvoisier\u2019s only a notorious old sponger whose husband had been an Imperial Prefect, the widow of the Director of Posts and sundry others known for their loyalty to Napoleon, their stupidity and their dullness. Princesse Mathilde, however, in no way stinted the generous and refreshing shower of her sovereign grace over these miserable scarecrows whom the Duchesse de Guermantes, for her part, took good care not to invite when it was her turn to entertain the Princess, but substituted for them without any abstract reasoning about Bonapartism the most brilliant coruscation of all the beauties, all the talents, all the celebrities, who, the exercise of some subtle sixth sense made her feel, would be acceptable to the niece of the Emperor even when they belonged actually to the Royal House. There was not lacking indeed the Due d\u2019Aumale, and when on withdrawing the Princess, raising Mme. de Guermantes from the ground where she had sunk in a curtsey and was trying to kiss the august hand, embraced her on both cheeks, it was from the bottom of her heart that she was able to assure the Duchess that never had she spent a happier afternoon nor seen so delightful a party. The Princesse de Parme was Courvoisier in her incapacity for innovation in social matters, but unlike the Courvoisiers the surprise that was perpetually caused her by the Duchesse de Guermantes engendered in her not, as in them, antipathy but admiration. This astonishment was still farther enhanced by the infinitely backward state of the Princess\u2019s education. Mme. de Guermantes was herself a great deal less advanced than she supposed. But it was enough for her to have gone a little beyond Mme. de Parme to stupefy that lady, and, as the critics of each generation confine themselves to maintaining the direct opposite of the truths admitted by their predecessors, she had only to say that Flaubert, that archenemy of the bourgeois, had been bourgeois through and through, or that there was a great deal of Italian music in Wagner, to open before the Princess, at the cost of a nervous exhaustion which recurred every time, as before the eyes of a swimmer in a stormy sea, horizons that seemed to her unimaginable and remained for ever vague. A stupefaction caused also by the paradoxes uttered with relation not only to works of art but to persons of their acquaintance and to current social events. No doubt the incapacity that prevented Mme. de Parme from distinguishing the true wit of the Guermantes from certain rudimentarily acquired forms of that wit (which made her believe in the high intellectual worth of certain, especially certain female Guermantes, of whom she was bewildered on hearing the Duchess confide to her with a smile that they were mere blockheads) was one of the causes of the astonishment which the Princess always felt on hearing Mme. de Guermantes criticise other people. But there was another cause also, one which I, who knew at this time more books than people and literature better than life, explained to myself by thinking that the Duchess, living this wordly life the idleness and sterility of which are to a true social activity what criticism, in art, is to creation, extended to the persons who surrounded her the instability of point of view, the uneasy thirst of the reasoner who to assuage a mind that has grown too dry goes in search of no matter what paradox that is still fairly new, and will make no bones about upholding the refreshing opinion that the really great Iphig\u00e9nie is Piccini\u2019s and not Gluck\u2019s, at a pinch the true Ph\u00e8dre that of Pradon\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When a woman who was intelligent, educated, witty had married a shy bumpkin whom one saw but seldom and never heard, Mme. de Guermantes one fine day would find a rare intellectual pleasure not only in decrying the wife but in \u2018discovering\u2019 the husband. In the Cambremer household for example, if she had lived in that section of society at the time, she would have decreed that Mme. de Cambremer was stupid, and that the really interesting person, misunderstood, delightful, condemned to silence by a chattering wife but himself worth a thousand of her, was the Marquis, and the Duchess would have felt on declaring this the same kind of refreshment as the critic who, after people have for seventy years been admiring Hernani, confesses to a preference for Le Lion Amoureux. And from this same morbid need of arbitrary novelties, if from her girlhood everyone had been pitying a model wife, a true saint, for being married to a scoundrel, one fine day Mme. de Guermantes would assert that this scoundrel was perhaps a frivolous man but one with a heart of gold, whom the implacable harshness of his wife had driven to do the most inconsistent things. I knew that it is not only over different works, in the long course of centuries, but over different parts of the same work that criticism plays, thrusting back into the shadow what for too long has been thought brilliant, and making emerge what has appeared to be doomed to permanent obscurity. I had not only seen Bellini, Winterhalter, the Jesuit architects, a Restoration cabinetmaker come to take the place of men of genius who were called \u2018worn out,\u2019 simply because they had worn out the lazy minds of the intellectuals, as neurasthenics are always worn out and always changing; I had seen preferred in Sainte-Beuve alternately the critic and the poet, Musset rejected so far as his poetry went save for a few quite unimportant little pieces. No doubt certain essayists are mistaken when they set above the most famous scenes in Le Cid or Polyeucte some speech from Le Menteur which, like an old plan, furnishes information about the Paris of the day, but their predilection, justified if not by considerations of beauty at least by a documentary interest, is still too rational for our criticism run mad. It will barter the whole of Moli\u00e8re for a line fromL\u2019Etourdi, and even when it pronounces Wagner\u2019s Tristan a bore will except a \u2018charming note on the horns\u2019 at the point where the hunt goes by. This depravation of taste helped me to understand that of which Mme. de Guermantes gave proof when she decided that a man of their world, recognised as a good fellow but a fool, was a monster of egoism, sharper than people thought \u2014 that another widely known for his generosity might be the personification of avarice, that a good mother paid no attention to her children, and that a woman generally supposed to be vicious was really actuated by the noblest feelings. As though spoiled by the nullity of life in society, the intelligence and perception of Mme. de Guermantes were too vacillating for disgust not to follow pretty swiftly in the wake of infatuation (leaving her still ready to feel herself attracted afresh by the kind of cleverness which she had in turn sought out and abandoned) and for the charm which she had felt in some warm-hearted man not to change, if he came too often to see her, sought too freely from her directions which she was incapable of giving him, into an irritation which she believed to be produced by her admirer but which was in fact due to the utter impossibility of finding pleasure when one does nothing else than seek it. The variations of the Duchess\u2019s judgment spared no one, except her husband. He alone had never been in love with her, in him she had always felt an iron character, indifferent to the caprices that she displayed, contemptuous of her beauty, violent, of a will that would never bend, the sort under which alone nervous people can find tranquillity. M. de Guermantes on the other hand, pursuing a single type of feminine beauty but seeking it in mistresses whom he constantly replaced, had, once he had left them, and to express derision of them, only an associate, permanent and identical, who irritated him often by her chatter but as to whom he knew that everyone regarded her as the most beautiful, the most virtuous, the cleverest, the best-read member of the aristocracy, as a wife whom he, M. de Guermantes, was only too fortunate to have found, who cloaked all his irregularities, entertained like no one else in the world, and upheld for their drawing-room its position as the premier in the Faubourg Saint-Germain. This common opinion he himself shared; often moved to ill-humour against her, he was proud of her. If, being as niggardly as he was fastidious, he refused her the most trifling sums for her charities or for the servants, yet he insisted upon her wearing the most sumptuous clothes and driving behind the best horses in Paris. Whenever Mme. de Guermantes had just perpetrated, with reference to the merits and defects, which she suddenly transposed, of one of their friends, a new and succulent paradox, she burned to make trial of it before people capable of relishing it, to bring out its psychological originality and to set its epigrammatic brilliance sparkling. No doubt these new opinions embodied as a rule no more truth than the old, often less; but this very element, arbitrary and incalculable, of novelty which they contained conferred on them something intellectual which made the communication of them exciting. Only the patient on whom the Duchess was exercising her psychological skill was generally an intimate friend as to whom those people to whom she longed to hand on her discovery were entirely unaware that he was not still at the apex of her favour; thus the reputation that Mme. de Guermantes had of being an incomparable friend, sentimental, tender and devoted, made it difficult for her to launch the attack herself; she could at the most intervene later on, as though under constraint, by uttering a response to appease, to contradict in appearance but actually to support a partner who had taken it on himself to provoke her; this was precisely the part in which M. de Guermantes excelled\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As for social activities, it was yet another form of pleasure, arbitrary and spectacular, that Mme. de Guermantes felt in uttering, with regard to them, those unexpected judgments which pricked with an incessant and exquisite feeling of surprise the Princesse de Parme. But with this one of the Duchess\u2019s pleasures it was not so much with the help of literary criticism as by following political life and the reports of parliamentary debates that I tried to understand in what it might consist. The successive and contradictory edicts by which Mme. de Guermantes continually reversed the scale of values among the people of her world no longer sufficing to distract her, she sought also in the manner in which she ordered her own social behaviour, in which she recorded her own most trivial decisions on points of fashion, to taste those artificial emotions, to fulfil those adventitious obligations which stimulate the perceptions of Parliaments and gain hold of the minds of politicians. We know that when a Minister explains to the Chamber that he believed himself to be acting rightly in following a line of conduct which does, as a matter of fact, appear quite straightforward to the commonsense person who next morning in his newspaper reads the report of the sitting, this commonsense reader does nevertheless feel himself suddenly stirred and begins to doubt whether he has been right in approving the Minister\u2019s conduct when he sees that the latter\u2019s speech was listened to with the accompaniment of a lively agitation and punctuated with expressions of condemnation such as: \u201cIt\u2019s most serious!\u201d ejaculated by a Deputy whose name and titles are so long, and followed in the report by movements so emphatic that in the whole interruption the words \u201cIt\u2019s most serious!\u201d occupy less room than a hemistich does in an alexandrine. For instance in the days when M. de Guermantes, Prince des Laumes, sat in the Chamber, one used to read now and then in the Paris newspapers, albeit it was intended primarily for the M\u00e9s\u00e9glise division, to shew the electors there that they had not given their votes to an inactive or voiceless mandatory:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (Monsieur de Guermantes-Bouillon, Prince des Laumes: \u201cThis is serious!\u201d \u201cHear, hear!\u201d from the Centre and some of the Right benches, loud exclamations from the Extreme Left.)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The commonsense reader still retains a gleam of faith in the sage Minister, but his heart is convulsed with a fresh palpitation by the first words of the speaker who rises to reply:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThe astonishment, it is not too much to say the stupor\u201d (keen sensation on the Right side of the House) \u201cthat I have felt at the words of one who is still, I presume, a member of the Government\u201d (thunder of applause) . . . Several Under-Secretaries of State for Posts and Telegraphs without Deputies then crowded round the Ministerial bench. Then rising from his seat, nodded his head in the affirmative\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This \u2018thunder of applause\u2019 carries away the last shred of resistance in the mind of the commonsense reader; he discovers to be an insult to the Chamber, monstrous in fact, a course of procedure which in itself is of no importance; it may be some normal action such as arranging that the rich shall pay more than the poor, bringing to light some piece of injustice, preferring peace to war; he will find it scandalous and will see in it an offence to certain principles to which as a matter of fact he had never given a thought, which are not engraved on the human heart, but which move him forcibly by reason of the acclamations which they provoke and the compact majorities which they assemble\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It must at the same time be recognised that this subtlety of the politician which served to explain to me the Guermantes circle, and other groups in society later on, is nothing more than the perversion of a certain fineness of interpretation often described as \u2018reading between the lines.\u2019 If in representative assemblies there is absurdity owing to perversion of this quality, there is equally stupidity, through the want of it, in the public who take everything \u2018literally,\u2019 who do not suspect a dismissal when a high dignitary is relieved of his office \u2018at his own request,\u2019 and say: \u201cHe cannot have been dismissed, since it was he who asked leave to retire,\u201d\u2014 a defeat when the Russians by a strategic movement withdraw upon a stronger position that has been prepared beforehand, a refusal when, a Province having demanded its independence from the German Emperor, he grants it religious autonomy. It is possible, moreover (to return to these sittings of the Chamber), that when they open the Deputies themselves are like the commonsense person who will read the published report. Learning that certain workers on strike have sent their delegates to confer with a Minister, they may ask one another innocently: \u201cThere now, I wonder what they can have been saying; let\u2019s hope it\u2019s all settled,\u201d at the moment when the Minister himself mounts the tribune in a solemn silence which has already brought artificial emotions into play. The first words of the Minister: \u201cThere is no necessity for me to inform the Chamber that I have too high a sense of what is the duty of the Government to have received a deputation of which the authority entrusted to me could take no cognisance,\u201d produce a dramatic effect, for this was the one hypothesis which the commonsense of the Deputies had not imagined. But precisely because of its dramatic effect it is greeted with such applause that it is only after several minutes have passed that the Minister can succeed in making himself heard, the Minister who will receive on returning to his place on the bench the congratulations of his colleagues. We are as deeply moved as on the day when the same Minister failed to invite to a big official reception the President of the Municipal Council who was supporting the Opposition, and declare that on this occasion as on the other he has acted with true statesmanship\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0M. de Guermantes at this period in his life had, to the great scandal of the Courvoisiers, frequently been among the crowd of Deputies who came forward to congratulate the Minister. I have heard it said afterwards that even at a time when he was playing a fairly important part in the Chamber and was being thought of in connexion with Ministerial office or an Embassy he was, when a friend came to ask a favour of him, infinitely more simple, behaved politically a great deal less like the important political personage than anyone else who did not happen to be Duc de Guermantes. For if he said that nobility made no difference, that he regarded his fellow Deputies as equals, he did not believe it for a moment. He sought, pretended to value but really despised political importance, and as he remained in his own eyes M. de Guermantes it did not envelop his person in that dead weight of high office which makes other politicians unapproachable. And in this way his pride guarded against every assault not only his manners which were of an ostentatious familiarity but also such true simplicity as he might actually have\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To return to those artificial and moving decisions such as are made by politicians, Mme. de Guermantes was no less disconcerting to the Guermantes, the Courvoisiers, the Faubourg in general and, more than anyone, the Princesse de Parme by her habit of issuing unaccountable decrees behind which one could feel to be latent principles which impressed one all the more, the less one expected them. If the new Greek Minister have a fancy dress ball, everyone chose a costume and asked everyone else what the Duchess would wear. One thought that she would appear as the Duchesse de Bourgogne, another suggested as probable the guise of Princess of Dujabar, a third Psyche. Finally, a Courvoisier having asked her: \u201cWhat are you going to wear, Oriane?\u201d provoked the one response of which nobody had thought: \u201cWhy, nothing at all!\u201d which at once set every tongue wagging, as revealing Oriane\u2019s opinion as to the true social position of the new Greek Minister and the proper attitude to adopt towards him, that is to say the opinion which ought to have been foreseen namely that a duchess \u2018was not expected\u2019 to attend the fancy dress bali given by this new Minister: \u201cI do not see that there is any necessity to go to the Greek Minister\u2019s; I do not know him; I am not a Greek; why should I go to these people\u2019s house, I have nothing to do with them?\u201d said the Duchess. \u201cBut everybody will be there, they say it\u2019s going to be charming!\u201d cried Mme. de Gallardon. \u201cStill, it\u2019s just as charming sometimes to sit by one\u2019s own fireside,\u201d replied Mme. de Guermantes. The Courvoisiers could not get over this, but the Guermantes, without copying it, approved of their cousin\u2019s attitude. \u201cNaturally, everybody isn\u2019t in a position like Oriane to break with all the conventions. But if you look at it in one way you can\u2019t say she was actually wrong in wishing to shew that we are going rather far in flinging ourselves at the feet of all these foreigners who appear from heaven knows where.\u201d Naturally, knowing the stream of comment which one or other attitude would not fail to provoke, Mme. de Guermantes took as much pleasure in appearing at a party to which her hostess had not dared to count on her coming as in staying at home or spending the evening at the play with her husband on the night of a party to which \u2018everybody was going,\u2019 or, again, when people imagined that she would eclipse the finest diamonds with some historic diadem, by stealing into the room without a single jewel, and in another style of dress than what had been, wrongly, supposed to be essential to the occasion. Albeit she was anti-Dreyfusard (while retaining her belief in the innocence of Dreyfus, just as she spent her life in the social world believing only in abstract ideas) she had created an enormous sensation at a party at the Princesse de Ligne\u2019s, first of all by remaining seated after all the ladies had risen to their feet as General Mercier entered the room, and then by getting up and in a loud voice asking for her carriage when a Nationalist orator had begun to address the gathering, thereby shewing that she did not consider that society was meant for talking politics; all heads were turned towards her at a Good Friday concert at which, although a Voltairean, she had not remained because she thought it indecent to bring Christ upon the stage. We know how important, even for the great queens of society, is that moment of the year at which the round of entertainment begins: so much so that the Marquise d\u2019Amoncourt, who, from a need to say something, a form of mania, and also from want of perception, was always making a fool of herself, had actually replied to somebody who had called to condole with her on the death of her father, M. de Montmorency: \u201cWhat makes it sadder still is that it should come at a time when one\u2019s mirror is simply stuffed with cards!\u201d Very well, at this point in the social year, when people invited the Duchesse de Guermantes to dinner, making every effort to see that she was not already engaged, she declined, for the one reason of which nobody in society would ever have thought; she was just starting on a cruise among the Norwegian fjords, which were so interesting. People in society were stupefied, and, without any thought of following the Duchess\u2019s example, derived nervertheless from her action that sense of relief which one has in reading Kant when after the most rigorous demonstration of determinism one finds that above the world of necessity there is the world of freedom. Every invention of which no one has ever thought before excites the interest even of people who can derive no benefit from it. That of steam navigation was a small thing compared with the employment of steam navigation at that sedentary time of year called \u2018the season.\u2019 The idea that anyone could voluntarily renounce a hundred dinners or luncheons, twice as many afternoon teas, three times as many evening parties, the most brilliant Mondays at the Opera and Tuesdays at the Fran\u00e7ais to visit the Norwegian fjords seemed to the Courvoisiers no more explicable than the idea of Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea, but conveyed to them a similar impression of independence and charm. So that not a day passed on which somebody might not be heard to ask, not merely: \u201cYou\u2019ve heard Oriane\u2019s latest joke?\u201d but \u201cYou know Oriane\u2019s latest?\u201d and on \u2018Oriane\u2019s latest\u2019 as on \u2018Oriane\u2019s latest joke\u2019 would follow the comment: \u201cHow typical of Oriane!\u201d \u201cIsn\u2019t that pure Oriane?\u201d Oriane\u2019s latest might be, for instance, that, having to write on behalf of a patriotic society to Cardinal X \u2014 Bishop of Macon (whom M. de Guermantes when he spoke of him invariably called \u2018Monsieur de Mascon,\u2019 thinking this to be \u2018old French\u2019), when everyone was trying to imagine what form the letter would take, and had no difficulty as to the opening words, the choice lying between \u2018Eminence,\u2019 and \u2018Monseigneur,\u2019 but was puzzled as to the rest, Oriane\u2019s letter, to the general astonishment, began: \u2018Monsieur le Cardinal,\u2019 following an old academic form, or: \u2018My Cousin,\u2019 this term being in use among the Princes of the Church, the Gsermantes and Crowned Heads, who prayed to God to take each and all of them into \u2018His fit and holy keeping.\u2019 To start people on the topic of an \u2018Oriane\u2019s latest\u2019 it was sufficient that at a performance at which all Paris was present and a most charming play was being given, when they looked for Mme. de Guermantes in the boxes of the Princesse de Parme, the Princesse de Guermantes, countless other ladies who had invited her, they discovered her sitting by herself, in black, with a tiny hat on her head, in a stall in which she had arrived before the curtain rose. \u201cYou hear better, when it\u2019s a play that\u2019s worth listening to,\u201d she explained, to the scandal of the Courvoisiers and the admiring bewilderment of the Guermantes and the Princesse de Parme, who suddenly discovered that the \u2018fashion\u2019 of hearing the beginning of a play was more up to date, was a proof of greater originality and intelligence (which need not astonish them, coming from Oriane) than that of arriving for the last act after a big dinner-party and \u2018going on\u2019 somewhere first. Such were the various kinds of surprise for which the Princesse de Parme knew that she ought to be prepared if she put a literary or social question to Mme. de Guermantes, one result of which was that during these dinner-parties at Oriane\u2019s her Royal Highness never ventured upon the slightest topic save with the uneasy and enraptured prudence of the bather emerging from between two breakers\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Among the elements which, absent from the three or four other more or less equivalent drawing-rooms that set the fashion for the Faubourg Saint-Germain, differentiated from them that of the Duchesse de Guermantes, just as Leibniz allows that each monad, while reflecting the entire universe, adds to it something of its own, one of the least attractive was regularly furnished by one or two extremely good-looking women who had no title to be there apart from their beauty and the use that M. de Guermantes had made of them, and whose presence revealed at once, as does in other drawing-rooms that of certain otherwise unaccountable pictures, that in this household the husband was an ardent appreciator of feminine graces. They were all more or less alike, for the Duke had a taste for large women, at once statuesque and loose-limbed, of a type half-way between the Venus of Milo and the Samothracian Victory; often fair, rarely dark, sometimes auburn, like the most recent, who was at this dinner, that Vicomtesse d\u2019Arpajon whom he had loved so well that for a long time he had obliged her to send him as many as ten telegrams daily (which slightly annoyed the Duchess), corresponded with her by carrier pigeon when he was at Guermantes, and from whom moreover he had long been so incapable of tearing himself away that, one winter which he had had to spend at Parma, he travelled back regularly every week to Paris, spending two days in the train, in order to see her\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As a rule these handsome \u2018supers\u2019 had been his mistresses but were no longer (as was Mme. d\u2019Arpajon\u2019s case) or were on the point of ceasing to be so. It may well have been that the importance which the Duchess enjoyed in their sight and the hope of being invited to her house, though they themselves came of thoroughly aristocratic, but still not quite first-class stock, had prompted them, even more than the good looks and generosity of the Duke, to yield to his desires. Not that the Duchess would have placed any insuperable obstacle in the way of their crossing her threshold: she was aware that in more than one of them she had found an ally, thanks to whom she had obtained a thousand things which she wanted but which M. de Guermantes pitilessly denied his wife so long as he was not in love with some one else. And so the reason why they were not invited by the Duchess until their intimacy with the Duke was already far advanced lay principally in the fact that he, every time that he had embarked on the deep waters of love, had imagined nothing more than a brief flirtation, as a reward for which he considered an invitation from his wife to be more than adequate. And yet he found himself offering this as the price of far less, for a first kiss in fact, because a resistance upon which he had never reckoned had been brought into play or because there had been no resistance. In love it often happens that gratitude, the desire to give pleasure, makes us generous beyond the limits of what the other person\u2019s expectation and self-interest could have anticipated. But then the realisation of this offer was hindered by conflicting circumstances. In the first place, all the women who had responded to M. de Guermantes\u2019s love, and sometimes even when they had not yet surrendered themselves to him, he had, one after another, segregated from the world. He no longer allowed them to see anyone, spent almost all his time in their company, looked after the education of their children to whom now and again, if one was to judge by certain speaking likenesses later on, he had occasion to present a little brother or sister. And so if, at the start of the connexion, the prospect of an introduction to Mme. de Guermantes, which had never crossed the mind of the Duke, had entered considerably into the thoughts of his mistress, their connexion had by itself altered the whole of the lady\u2019s point of view; the Duke was no longer for her merely the husband of the smartest woman in Paris, but a man with whom his new mistress was in love, a man moreover who had given her the means and the inclination for a more luxurious style of living and had transposed the relative importance in her mind of questions of social and of material advantage; while now and then a composite jealousy, into which all these factors entered, of Mme. de Guermantes animated the Duke\u2019s mistresses. But this case was the rarest of all; besides, when the day appointed for the introduction at length arrived (at a point when as a rule the Duke had lost practically all interest in the matter, his actions, like everyone\u2019s else, being generally dictated by previous actions the prime motive of which had already ceased to exist), it frequently happened that it was Mme. de Guermantes who had sought the acquaintance of the mistress in whom she hoped, and so greatly needed, to discover, against her dread husband, a valuable ally. This is not to say that, save at rare moments, in their own house, where, when the Duchess talked too much, he let fall a few words or, more dreadful still, preserved a silence which rendered her speechless, M. de Guermantes failed in his outward relations with his wife to observe what are called the forms. People who did not know them might easily misunderstand. Sometimes between the racing at Deauville, the course of waters and the return to Guermantes for the shooting, in the few weeks which people spend in Paris, since the Duchess had a liking for caf\u00e9-concerts, the Duke would go with her to spend the evening at one of these. The audience remarked at once, in one of those little open boxes in which there is just room for two, this Hercules in his \u2018smoking\u2019 (for in France we give to everything that is more or less British the one name that it happens not to bear in England), his monocle screwed in his eye, in his plump but finely shaped hand, on the ring-finger of which there glowed a sapphire, a plump cigar from which now and then he drew a puff of smoke, keeping his eyes for the most part on the stage but, when he did let them fall upon the audience in which there was absolutely no one whom he knew, softening them with an air of gentleness, reserve, courtesy and consideration. When a verse struck him as amusing and not too indecent, the Duke would turn round with a smile to his wife, letting her share, by a twinkle of good-natured understanding, the innocent merriment which the new song had aroused in himself. And the spectators might believe that there was no better husband in the world than this, nor anyone more enviable than the Duchess \u2014 that woman outside whom every interest in the Duke\u2019s life lay, that woman with whom he was not in love, to whom he had been consistently unfaithful; when the Duchess felt tired, they saw M. de Guermantes rise, put on her cloak with his own hands, arranging her necklaces so that they did not catch in the lining, and clear a path for her to the street with an assiduous and respectful attention which she received with the coldness of the woman of the world who sees in such behaviour simply conventional politeness, at times even with the slightly ironical bitterness of the disabused spouse who has no illusion left to shatter. But despite these externals (another element of that politeness which has made duty evolve from the depths of our being to the surface, at a period already remote but still continuing for its survivors) the life of the Duchess was by no means easy. M. de Guermantes never became generous or human save for a new mistress who would take, as it generally happened, the Duchess\u2019s part; the latter saw becoming possible for her once again generosities towards inferiors, charities to the poor, even for herself, later on, a new and sumptuous motor-car. But from the irritation which developed as a rule pretty rapidly in Mme. de Guermantes at people whom she found too submissive the Duke\u2019s mistresses were not exempt. Presently the Duchess grew tired of them. Simultaneously, at this moment, the Duke\u2019s intimacy with Mme. d\u2019Arpajon was drawing to an end. Another mistress dawned on the horizon\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0No doubt the love which M. de Guermantes had had for each of them in succession would begin one day to make itself felt afresh; in the first place, this love in dying bequeathed them, like beautiful marbles \u2014 marbles beautiful to the Duke, become thus in part an artist, because he had loved them and was sensitive now to lines which he would not have appreciated without love \u2014 which brought into juxtaposition in the Duchess\u2019s drawing-room their forms long inimical, devoured by jealousies and quarrels, and finally reconciled in the peace of friendship; besides, this friendship itself was an effect of the love which had made M. de Guermantes observe in those who were his mistresses virtues which exist in every human being but are perceptible only to the sensual eye, so much so that the ex-mistr\u00eass, become \u2018the best of comrades\u2019 who would do anything in the world for one, is as recognised a type as the doctor or father who is not a doctor or a father but a friend. But during a period of transition the woman whom M. de Guermantes was preparing to abandon bewailed her lot, made scenes, shewed herself exacting, appeared indiscreet, became a nuisance. The Duke began to take a dislike to her. Then Mme. de Guermantes had an opportunity to bring into prominence the real or imagined defects of a person who annoyed her. Known as a kind woman, Mme. de Guermantes received the telephone messages, the confidences, the tears of the abandoned mistress and made no complaint. She laughed at them, first with her husband, then with a few chosen friends. And imagining that this pity which she shewed for the poor wretch gave her the right to make fun of her, even to her face, whatever the lady might say, provided it could be included among the attributes of the character for absurdity which the puke and Duchess had recently fabricated for her, Mme. de Guermantes had no hesitation in exchanging with her husband a glance of ironical connivance\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Meanwhile, as she sat down to table, the Princesse de Parme remembered that she had thought of inviting a certain other Princess to the Opera, and, wishing to be assured that this would not in any way offend Mme. de Guermantes, was preparing to sound her. At this moment there entered M. de Grouchy, whose train, owing to some block on the line, had been held up for an hour. He made what excuses he could. His wife, had she been a Courvoisier, would have died of shame. But Mme. de Grouchy was not a Guermantes for nothing. As her husband was apologising for being late:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI see,\u201d she broke in, \u201cthat even in little things arriving late is a tradition in your family.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSit down, Grouchy, and don\u2019t let them pull your leg,\u201d said the Duke\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI hope I move with the times, still I must admit that the Battle of Waterloo had its points, since it brought about the Restoration of the Bourbons, and better still in a way which made them unpopular. But you seem to be a regular Nimrod!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWell, as a matter of fact, I have had quite a good bag. I shall take the liberty of sending the Duchess six brace of pheasants to-morrow.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0An idea seemed to flicker in the eyes of Mme. de Guermantes. She insisted that M. de Grouchy must not give himself the trouble of sending the pheasants. And making a sign to the betrothed footman with whom I had exchanged a few words on my way from the Elstir room:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cPoullein,\u201d she told him, \u201cyou will go to-morrow and fetch M. le Comte\u2019s pheasants and bring them straight back \u2014 you won\u2019t mind, will you, Grouchy, if I make a few little presents. Basin and I can\u2019t eat a whole dozen by ourselves.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut the day after to-morrow will be soon enough,\u201d said M. de Grouchy\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo, to-morrow suits me better,\u201d the Duchess insisted\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Poullein had turned pale; his appointment with his sweetheart would have to be missed. This was quite enough for the diversion of the Duchess, who liked to appear to be taking a human interest in everyone. \u201cI know it\u2019s your day out,\u201d she went on to Poullein, \u201call you\u2019ve got to do is to change with Georges; he can take to-morrow off and stay in the day after.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But the day after, Poullein\u2019s sweetheart would not be free. A holiday then was of no account to him. As soon as he was out of the room, everyone complimented the Duchess on the interest she took in her servants. \u201cBut I only behave towards them as I like people to behave to me.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s just it. They can say they\u2019ve found a good place with you.\u201d \u201cOh, nothing so very wonderful. But I think they all like me. That one is a little annoying because he\u2019s in love. He thinks it incumbent on him to go about with a long face.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At this point Poullein reappeared. \u201cYou\u2019re quite right,\u201d said M. de Grouchy, \u201che doesn\u2019t look much like smiling. With those fellows one has to be good but not too good.\u201d \u201cI admit I\u2019m not a very dreadful mistress. He\u2019ll have nothing to do all day but call for your pheasants, sit in the house doing nothing and eat his share of them.\u201d \u201cThere are plenty of people who would be glad to be in his place,\u201d said M. de Grouchy, for envy makes men blind\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOriane,\u201d began the Princesse de Parme, \u201cI had a visit the other day from your cousin Heudicourt; of course she\u2019s a highly intelligent woman \u2014 she\u2019s a Guermantes, one can say no more, but they tell me she has a spitel ful tongue.\u201d The Duke fastened on his wife a slow gaze of deliberate stupefaction. Mme. de Guermantes began to smile. Gradually the Princess became aware of their pantomime. \u201cBut . . . do you mean to say you don\u2019t agree with me?\u201d she stammered with growing uneasiness. \u201cReally Ma\u2019am, it\u2019s too good of you to pay any attention to Basin\u2019s faces. Now\u2019 Basin, you\u2019re not to hint nasty things about our cousins.\u201d \u201cHe thinks her too wicked?\u201d inquired the Princess briskly. \u201cOh, dear me, no!\u201d replied the Duchess. \u201cI don\u2019t know who told your Highness that she was spiteful. On the contrary, she\u2019s an excellent creature who never said any harm of anyone, or did any harm to any one.\u201d \u201cAh!\u201d sighed Mme. de Parme, greatly relieved. \u201cI must say I never noticed anything myself. But I know it\u2019s often difficult not to be a little spiteful when one is so full of wit . . . \u201d \u201cAh! Now that is a quality of which she has even less.\u201d \u201cLess wit?\u201d asked the stupefied Princess. \u201cCome now, Oriane,\u201d broke in the Duke in a plaintive tone, casting to right and left of him a glance of amusement, \u201cyou heard the Princess tell you that she was a superior woman.\u201d \u201cBut isn\u2019t she?\u201d \u201cSuperior in chest measurement, at any rate.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t listen to him, Ma\u2019am, he\u2019s not sincere; she\u2019s as stupid as a (h\u2019m) goose,\u201d came in a loud and rasping voice from Mme. de Guermantes, who, a great deal more \u2018old French\u2019 even than the Duke when he was not trying, did often deliberately seek to be, but in a manner the opposite of the lace-neckcloth, deliquescent style of her husband and in reality far more subtle, by a sort of almost peasant pronunciation which had a harsh and delicious flavour of the soil. \u201cBut she\u2019s the best woman in the world. Besides, I don\u2019t really know that one can call it stupidity when it\u2019s carried to such a point as that. I don\u2019t believe I ever met anyone quite like her; she\u2019s a case for a specialist, there\u2019s something pathological about her, she\u2019s a sort of \u2018innocent\u2019 or \u2018cretin\u2019 or an \u2018arrested development,\u2019 like the people you see in melodramas, or in L\u2019Arl\u00e9sienne. I always ask myself, when she comes to see me, whether the moment may not have arrived at which her intelligence is going to dawn, which makes me a little nervous always.\u201d The Princess was lost in admiration of these utterances but remained stupefied by the preceding verdict. \u201cShe repeated to me \u2014 and so did Mme. d\u2019Epinay \u2014 what you said about \u2018Teaser Augustus.\u2019 It\u2019s delicious,\u201d she put in\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0M. de Guermantes explained the joke to me. I wanted to tell him that his brother, who pretended not to know me, was expecting me that same evening at eleven o\u2019clock. But I had not asked Robert whether I might mention this engagement, and as the fact that M. de Charlus had practically fixed it with me himself directly contradicted what he had told the Duchess I judged it more tactful to say nothing. \u201c\u2018Teaser Augustus\u2019 was not bad,\u201d said M. de Guermantes, \u201cbut Mme. d\u2019Heudicourt probably did not tell you a far better thing that Oriane said to her the other day in reply to an invitation to luncheon.\u201d \u201cNo, indeed! Do tell me!\u201d \u201cNow Basin, you keep quiet; in the first place, it was a stupid remark, and it will make the Princess think me inferior even to my fool of a cousin. Though I don\u2019t know why I should call her my cousin. She\u2019s one of Basin\u2019s cousins. Still, I believe she is related to me in some sort of way.\u201d \u201cOh!\u201d cried the Princesse de Parme, at the idea that she could possibly think Mme. de Guermantes stupid, and protesting helplessly that nothing could ever lower the Duchess from the place she held in her estimation. \u201cBesides we have already subtracted from her the quality of wit; as what I said to her tends to deny her certain other good qualities also, it seems to me inopportune to repeat it.\u201d \u201c\u2018Deny her!\u2019 \u2018Inopportune!\u2019 How well she expresses herself!\u201d said the Duke with a pretence of irony, to win admiration for the Duchess. \u201cNow, then, Basin, you\u2019re not to make fun of your wife.\u201d \u201cI should explain to your Royal Highness,\u201d went on the Duke, \u201cthat Oriane\u2019s cousin may be superior, good, stout, anything you like to mention, but she is not exactly \u2014 what shall I say \u2014 lavish.\u201d \u201cNo, I know, she\u2019s terribly close-fisted,\u201d broke in the Princess. \u201cI should not have ventured to use the expression, but you have hit on exactly the right word. You can see it in her house-keeping, and especially in the cooking, which is excellent, but strictly rationed.\u201d \u201cWhich leads to some quite amusing scenes,\u201d M. de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9 interrupted him. \u201cFor instance, my dear Basin, I was down at Heudicourt one day when you were expected, Oriane and yourself. They had made the most elaborate preparations when, during the afternoon, a footman brought in a telegram to say that you weren\u2019t coming.\u201d \u201cThat doesn\u2019t surprise me!\u201d said the Duchess, who not only was difficult to secure, but liked people to know as much. \u201cYour cousin read the telegram, was duly distressed, then immediately, without losing her head, telling herself that there was no point in going to unnecessary expense for so unimportant a gentleman as myself, called the footman back. \u2018Tell the cook not to put on the chicken!\u2019 she shouted after him. And that evening I heard her asking the butler: \u2018Well? What about the beef that was left over yesterday? Aren\u2019t you going to let us have that?\u2019\u201d \u201cAll the same, one must admit that the cheer you get there is of the very best,\u201d said the Duke, who fancied that in using this language he shewed himself to belong to the old school. \u201cI don\u2019t know any house where one gets better food.\u201d \u201cOr less,\u201d put in the Duchess. \u201cIt is quite wholesome and quite enough for what you would call a vulgar yokel like myself,\u201d went on the Duke, \u201cone keeps one\u2019s appetite.\u201d \u201cOh, if it\u2019s to be taken as a cure, it\u2019s certainly more hygienic than sumptuous. Not that it\u2019s as good as all that,\u201d added Mme. de Guermantes, who was not at all pleased that the title of \u2018best table in Paris\u2019 should be awarded to any but her own. \u201cWith my cousin it\u2019s just the same as with those costive authors who hatch out every fifteen years a one-act play or a sonnet. The sort of thing people call a little masterpiece, trifles that are perfect gems, in fact the one thing I loathe most in the world. The cooking at Z\u00e9na\u00efde\u2019s is not bad, but you would think it more ordinary if she was less parsimonious. There are some things her cook does quite well, and others that he spoils. I have had some thoroughly bad dinners there, as in most houses, only they\u2019ve done me less harm there because the stomach is, after all, more sensitive to quantity than to quality.\u201d \u201cWell, to get on with the story,\u201d the Duke concluded \u201cZ\u00e9na\u00efde insisted that Oriane should go to luncheon there, and as my wife is not very fond of going out anywhere she resisted, wanted to be sure that under the pretence of a quiet meal she was not being trapped into some great banquet, and tried in vain to find out who else were to be of the party. \u2018You must come,\u2019 Z\u00e9na\u00efde insisted, boasting of all the good things there would be to eat. \u2018You are going to have a pur\u00e9e of chestnuts, I need say no more than that, and there will be seven littlebouch\u00e9es \u00e0 la reine.\u2019 \u2018Seven little bouch\u00e9es!\u2019 cried Oriane, \u2018that means that we shall be at least eightl\u2019\u201d There was silence for a few seconds, and then the Princess having seen the point let her laughter explode like a peal of thunder. \u201cAh! \u2018Then we shall be eight,\u2019\u2014 it\u2019s exquisite. How very well phrased!\u201d she said, having by a supreme effort recaptured the expression she had heard used by Mme. d\u2019Epinay, which this time was more appropriate. \u201cOriane, that was very charming of the Princess, she said your remark was well phrased.\u201d \u201cBut, my dear, you\u2019re telling me nothing new. I know how clever the Princess is,\u201d replied Mme. de Guermantes, who readily assimilated a remark when it was uttered at once by a Royal Personage and in praise of her own wit. \u201cI am very proud that Ma\u2019am should appreciate my humble phrasings. I don\u2019t remember, though, that I ever did say such a thing, and if I did it must have been to flatter my cousin, for if she had ordered seven \u2018mouthfuls,\u2019 the mouths, if I may so express myself, would have been a round dozen if not more.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cShe used to have all M. de Bornier\u2019s manuscripts,\u201d went on the Princess, still speaking of Mme. d\u2019Heudicourt, and anxious to make the most of the excellent reasons she might have for associating with that lady. \u201cShe must have dreamed it, I don\u2019t believe she ever even know him,\u201d said the Duchess. \u201cWhat is really interesting about him is that he kept up a correspondence with people of different nationalities at the same time,\u201d put in the Vicomtesse d\u2019Arpajon who, allied to the principal ducal and even reigning families of Europe, was always glad that people should be reminded of the fact. \u201cSurely, Oriane,\u201d said M. de Guermantes, with ulterior purpose, \u201cyou can\u2019t have forgotten that dinner-party where you had M. de Bornier sitting next to you!\u201d \u201cBut, Basin,\u201d the Duchess interrupted him, \u201cif you mean to inform me that I knew M. de Bornier, why of course I did, he even called upon me several times, but I could never bring myself to invite him to the house because I should always have been obliged to have it disinfected afterwards with formol. As for the dinner you mean, I remember it only too well, but it was certainly not at Z\u00e9na\u00efde\u2019s, who never set eyes on Bornier in her life, and would probably think if you spoke to her of the Fille de Roland that you meant a Bonaparte Princess who was said at one time to be engaged to the son of the King of Greece; no, it was at the Austrian Embassy. Dear Hoyos imagined he was giving me a great treat by planting on the chair next to mine that pestiferous academician. I quite thought I had a squadron of mounted police sitting beside me. I was obliged to stop my nose as best I could, all through dinner; until the gruy\u00e8re came round I didn\u2019t dare to breathe.\u201d M. de Guermantes, whose secret object was attained, made a furtive examination of his guests\u2019 faces to judge the effect of the Duchess\u2019s pleasantry. \u201cYou were speaking of correspondence; I must say, I thought Gambetta\u2019s admirable,\u201d she went on, to shew that she was not afraid to be found taking an interest in a proletarian and a radical. M. de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9, who fully appreciated the brilliance of this feat of daring, gazed round him with an eye at once flashing and affectionate, after which he wiped his monocle\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cGad, it\u2019s infernally dull that Fille de Roland,\u201d said M. de Guermantes, with the satisfaction which he derived from the sense of his own superiority to a work which had bored him so, perhaps also from the suave mari magno feeling one has in the middle of a good dinner, when one recalls so terrible an evening in the past. \u201cStill, there were some quite good lines in it, and a patriotic sentiment.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I let it be understood that I had no admiration for M. de Bornier. \u201cIndeed! You have some fault to find with him?\u201d the Duke asked with a note of curiosity, for he always imagined when anyone spoke ill of a man that it must be on account of a personal resentment, just as to speak well of a woman marked the beginning of a love-affair. \u201cI see you\u2019ve got your knife into him. What did he do to you? You must tell us. Why yes, there must be some skeleton in the cupboard or you wouldn\u2019t run him down. It\u2019s long-winded, the Fille de Roland, but it\u2019s quite strong in parts.\u201d \u201cStrong is just the right word for an author who smelt like that,\u201d Mme. de Guermantes broke in sarcastically. \u201cIf this poor boy ever found himself face to face with him, I can quite understand that he carried away an impression in his nostrils!\u201d \u201cI must confess, though, to Ma\u2019am,\u201d the Duke went on, addressing the Princesse de Parme, \u201cthat quite apart from theFille de Roland, in literature and even in music I am terribly old-fashioned; no old nightingale can be too stale for my taste. You won\u2019t believe me, perhaps, but in the evenings, if my wife sits down to the piano, I find myself calling for some old tune by Auber or Boieldieu, or even Beethoven! That\u2019s the sort of thing that appeals to me. As for Wagner, he sends me to sleep at once.\u201d \u201cYou are wrong there,\u201d said Mme. de Guermantes, \u201cin spite of his insufferable long-windedness, Wagner was a genius. Lohengrin is a masterpiece. Even in Tristan there are some amusing passages scattered about. And the Chorus of Spinners in the Flying Dutchman is a perfect marvel.\u201d \u201cA\u2019n\u2019t I right, Babal,\u201d said M. de Guermantes, turning to M. de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9, \u201cwhat we like is:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Les rendez-vous de noble compagnie\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Se donnent tous en ce charmant s\u00e9jour\n\nIt\u2019s delicious. And Fra Diavolo, and the Magic Flute, and the Chalet, and the Marriage of Figaro, and the Diamants de la Couronne \u2014 there\u2019s music for you! It\u2019s the same thing in literature. For instance, I adore Balzac, theBal de Sceaux, the Mohicans de Paris.\u201d \u201cOh, my dear, if you are going to begin about Balzac, we shall never hear the end of it; do wait, keep it for some evening when M\u00e9m\u00e9\u2018s here. He\u2019s even better, he knows it all by heart.\u201d Irritated by his wife\u2019s interruption, the Duke held her for some seconds under the fire of a menacing silence. And his huntsman\u2019s eyes reminded me of a brace of loaded pistols. Meanwhile Mme. d\u2019Arpajon had been exchanging with the Princesse de Parme, upon tragic and other kinds of poetry, a series of remarks which did not reach me distinctly until I caught the following from Mme. d\u2019Arpajon: \u201cOh, Ma\u2019am is sure to be right; I quite admit he makes the world seem ugly, because he\u2019s unable to distinguish between ugliness and beauty, or rather because his insufferable vanity makes him believe that everything he says is beautiful; I agree with your Highness that in the piece we are speaking of there are some ridiculous things, quite unintelligible, errors of taste, that it is difficult to understand, that it\u2019s as much trouble to read as if it was written in Russian or Chinese, for of course it\u2019s anything in the world but French, still when one has taken the trouble, how richly one is rewarded, it\u2019s so full of imagination!\u201d Of this little lecture I had missed the opening sentences. I gathered in the end not only that the poet incapable of distinguishing between beauty and ugliness was Victor Hugo, but furthermore that the poem which was as difficult to understand as Chinese or Russian was\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lorsque l\u2019enfant para\u00eet, le cercle de famille\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Applaudit \u00e0 grands cris\n\nA piece dating from the poet\u2019s earliest period, and perhaps even nearer to Mme. Deshouli\u00e8res than to the Victor Hugo of the L\u00e9gende des Si\u00e8cles. Far from condemning Mme. d\u2019Arpajon as absurd, I saw her (the only one, at that table so matter-of-fact, so nondescript, at which I had sat down with such keen disappointment), I saw her in my mind\u2019s eye crowned with that lace cap, with the long spiral ringlets falling from it on either side, which was worn by Mme. de R\u00e9musat, Mme. de Broglie, Mme. de Saint-Aularie, all those distinguished women who in their fascinating letters quote with so much learning and so aptly passages from Sophocles, Schiller and theImitation, but in whom the earliest poetry of the Romantics induced the alarm and exhaustion inseparable for my grandmother from the latest verses of St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9. \u201cMme. d\u2019Arpajon is very fond of poetry,\u201d said the Princesse de Parme to her hostess, impressed by the ardent tone in which the speech had been delivered. \u201cNo; she knows absolutely nothing about it,\u201d replied Mme. de Guermantes in an undertone, taking advantage of the fact that Mme. d\u2019Arpajon, who was dealing with an objection raised by General de Beautreillis, was too much intent upon what she herself was saying to hear what was being murmured by the Duchess. \u201cShe has become literary since she\u2019s been forsaken. I can tell your Highness that it is I who have to bear the whole burden of it because it is to me that she comes in floods of tears whenever Basin hasn\u2019t been to see her, which is practically every day. And yet it isn\u2019t my fault, after all, if she bores him, and I can\u2019t force him to go to her, although I would rather he were a little more faithful to her, because then I shouldn\u2019t see quite so much of her myself. But she drives him crazy, and there\u2019s nothing extraordinary in that. She isn\u2019t a bad sort, but she\u2019s boring to a degree you can\u2019t imagine. And all this because Basin took it into his head for a year or so to play me false with her. And to have in addition a footman who has fallen in love with a little street-walker and goes about with a long face if I don\u2019t request the young person to leave her profitable pavement for half an hour and come to tea with me! Oh! Life really is too tedious!\u201d the Duchess languorously concluded. Mme. d\u2019Arpajon bored M. de Guermantes principally because he had recently fallen in love with another, whom I discovered to be the Marquise de Surgis-le-Duc. At this moment the footman who had been deprived of his holiday was waiting at table. And it struck me that, still disconsolate, he was doing it with a good deal of difficulty, for I noticed that, in handing the dish to M. de Ch\u00e2tellerault, he performed his task so awkwardly that the Duke\u2019s elbow came in contact several times with his own. The young Duke was not in the least annoyed with the blushing footman, but looked up at him rather with a smile in his clear blue eyes. This good humour seemed to me on the guest\u2019s part to betoken a kindness of heart. But the persistence of his smile led me to think that, aware of the servant\u2019s discomfiture, what he felt was perhaps really a malicious joy. \u201cBut, my dear, you know you\u2019re not revealing any new discovery when you tell us about Victor Hugo,\u201d went on the Duchess, this time addressing Mme. d\u2019Arpajon whom she had just seen turn away from the General with a troubled air. \u201cYou mustn\u2019t expect to launch that young genius. Everybody knows that he has talent. What is utterly detestable is the Victor Hugo of the last stage, the L\u00e9gende des Si\u00e8cles, I forget all their names. But in the Feuilles d\u2019Automne, the Chants du Cr\u00e9puscule, there\u2019s a great deal that\u2019s the work of a poet, a true poet! Even in theContemplations,\u201d went on the Duchess, whom none of her listeners dared to contradict, and with good reason, \u201cthere are still some quite pretty things. But I confess that I prefer not to venture farther than theCrepuscule! And then in the finer poems of Victor Hugo, and there really are some, one frequently comes across an idea, even a profound idea.\u201d And with the right shade of sentiment, bringing out the sorrowful thought with the full strength of her intonation, planting it somewhere beyond the sound of her voice, and fixing straight in front of her a charming, dreamy gaze, the Duchess said slowly: \u201cTake this:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0La douleur est un fruit\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0.Dieu ne le fait pas cro\u00eetre\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sur la branche trop faible encor pour le porter\n\nOr, better still:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Les morts durent bien peu\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0H\u00e9las, dans le cercueil ils tombent en poussi\u00e8re\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moins vite qu\u2019en nos coeurs!\u201d\n\nAnd, while a smile of disillusionment contracted with a graceful undulation her sorrowing lips, the Duchess fastened on Mme. d\u2019Arpajon the dreaming gaze of her charming, clear blue eyes. I was beginning to know them, as well as her voice, with its heavy drawl, its harsh savour. In those eyes and in that voice, I recognised much of the life of nature round Combray. Certainly, in the affectation with which that voice brought into prominence at times a rudeness of the soil there was more than one element: the wholly provincial origin of one branch of the Guermantes family, which had for long remained more localised, more hardy, wilder, more provoking than the rest; and also the usage of really distinguished people, and of witty people who know that distinction does not consist in mincing speech, and the usage of nobles who fraternise more readily with their peasants than with the middle classes; peculiarities all of which the regal position of Mme. de Guermantes enabled her to display more easily to bring out with every sail spread. It appears that the same voice existed also in certain of her sisters whom she detested, and who, less intelligent than herself and almost plebeianly married, if one may coin this adverb to speak of unions with obscure noblemen, entrenched on their provincial estates, or, in Paris, in a Faubourg Saint-Germain of no brilliance, possessed this voice also but had bridled it, corrected it, softened it so far as lay in their power, just as it is very rarely that any of us presumes on his own originality and does not apply himself diligently to copying the most approved models. But Oriane was so much more intelligent, so much richer, above all, so much more in fashion than her sisters, she had so effectively, when Princesse des Laumes, behaved just as she pleased in the company of the Prince of Wales, that she had realised that this discordant voice was an attraction, and had made of it, in the social order, with the courage of originality rewarded by success, what in the theatrical order a R\u00e9jane, a Jeanne Granier (which implies no comparison, naturally, between the respective merits and talents of those two actresses) had made of theirs, something admirable and distinctive which possibly certain R\u00e9jane and Granier sisters, whom no one has ever known, strove to conceal as a defect\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To all these reasons for displaying her local originality, the favourite writers of Mme. de Guermantes \u2014 M\u00e9rim\u00e9e, Meilhac and Hal\u00e9vy \u2014 had brought in addition, with the respect for what was natural, a feeling for the prosaic by which she attained to poetry and a spirit purely of society which called up distant landscapes before my eyes. Besides, the Duchess was fully capable, adding to these influences an artistic research of her own, of having chosen for the majority of her words the pronunciation that seemed to her most \u2018He de France,\u2019 most \u2018Champenoise,\u2019 since, if not quite to the same extent as her sister-in-law Marsantes, she rarely used anything but the pure vocabulary that might have been employed by an old French writer. And when one was tired of the composite patchwork of modern speech, it was, albeit one was aware that she expressed far fewer ideas, a thorough relaxation to listen to the talk of Mme. de Guermantes \u2014 almost the same feeling, if one was alone with her and she restrained and clarified still further her flow of words, as one has on hearing an old song. Then, as I looked at, as I listened to Mme. de Guermantes, I could see, a prisoner in the perpetual and quiet afternoon of her eyes, a sky of the He de France or of Champagne spread itself, grey-blue, oblique, with the same angle of inclination as in the eyes of Saint-Loup\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, by these several formations, Mme. de Guermantes expressed at once the most ancient aristocratic France, then, from a far later source, the manner in which the Duchesse de Broglie might have enjoyed and found fault with Victor Hugo under the July Monarchy, and, finally, a keen taste for the literature that sprang from M\u00e9rim\u00e9e and Meilhac. The first of these formations attracted me more than the second, did more to console me for the disappointments of my pilgrimage to and arrival in the Faubourg Saint-Germain, so different from what I had imagined it to be; but even the second I preferred to the last. For, so long as Mme. de Guermantes was being, almost spontaneously, a Guermantes and nothing more, her Pailleronism, her taste for the younger Dumas were reflected and deliberate. As this taste was the opposite of my own, she was productive, to my mind, of literature when she talked to me of the Faubourg Saint-Germain, and never seemed to me so stupidly Faubourg Saint-Germain as when she was talking literature\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moved by this last quotation, Mme. d\u2019Arpajon exclaimed: \u201c\u2019Ces reliques du coeur ont aussi leur poussi\u00e8re!\u2019 Sir, you must write that down for me on my fan,\u201d she said to M. de Guermantes. \u201cPoor woman, I feel sorry for her!\u201d said the Princesse de Parme to Mme. de Guermantes. \u201cNo, really, Ma\u2019am, you must not be soft-hearted, she has only got what she deserves.\u201d \u201cBut \u2014 you\u2019ll forgive me for saying this to you \u2014 she does really love him all the same!\u201d \u201cOh, not at all; she isn\u2019t capable of it; she thinks she loves him just as she thought just now she was quoting Victor Hugo, when she repeated a line from Musset. Listen,\u201d the Duchess went on in a tone of melancholy, \u201cnobody would be more touched than myself by any true sentiment. But let me give you an instance. Only yesterday, she made a terrible scene with Basin. Your Highness thinks perhaps that it was because he\u2019s in love with other women, because he no longer loves her; not in the least, it was because he won\u2019t put her sons down for the Jockey. Does Ma\u2019am call that the behaviour of a woman in love? No; I will go farther;\u201d Mme. de Guermantes added with precision, \u201cshe is a person of singular insensibility.\u201d Meanwhile it was with an eye sparkling with satisfaction that M. de Guermantes had listened to his wife talking about Victor Hugo \u2018point-blank\u2019 and quoting his poetry. The Duchess might frequently annoy him; at moments like this he was proud of her. \u201cOriane is really extraordinary. She can talk about anything, she has read everything. She could not possibly have guessed that the conversation this evening would turn on Victor Hugo. Whatever subject you take up, she is ready for you, she can hold her own with the most learned scholars. This young man must be quite captivated.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDo let us change the conversation,\u201d Mme. de Guermantes went on, \u201cbecause she\u2019s dreadfully susceptible. You will think me quite old-fashioned,\u201d she began, turning to me. \u201cI know that nowadays it\u2019s considered a weakness to care for ideas in poetry, poetry with some thought in it.\u201d \u201cOld-fashioned?\u201d asked the Princesse de Parme, quivering with the slight thrill sent through her by this new wave which she had not expected, albeit she knew that the conversation of the Duchesse de Guermantes always held in store for her these continuous and delightful shocks, that breath-catching panic, that wholesome exhaustion after which her thoughts instinctively turned to the necessity of taking a footbath in a dressing cabin and a brisk walk to \u2018restore her circulation.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cFor my part, no, Oriane,\u201d said Mme. de Brissac, \u201cI don\u2019t in the least object to Victor Hugo\u2019s having ideas, quite the contrary, but I do object to his seeking for them in sheer monstrosities. After all, it was he who accustomed us to ugliness in literature. There are quite enough ugly things already in real life. Why can\u2019t we be allowed at least to forget it while we are reading. A distressing spectacle, from which we should turn away in real life, that is what attracts Victor Hugo.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cVictor Hugo is not as realistic as Zola though, surely?\u201d asked the Princesse de Parme. The name of Zola did not stir a muscle on the face of M. de Beautreillis. The General\u2019s anti-Dreyfusism was too deep-rooted for him to seek to give expression to it. And his good-natured silence when anyone broached these topics moved the profane heart as a proof of the same delicacy that a priest shews in avoiding any reference to your religious duties, a financier when he takes care not to recommend your investing in the companies which he himself controls, a strong man when he behaves with lamblike gentleness and does not hit you in the jaw. \u201cI know you\u2019re related to Admiral Jurien de la Gravi\u00e8re,\u201d was murmured to me with an air of connivance by Mme. de Varambon, the lady in waiting to the Princesse de Parme, an excellent but limited woman, procured for the Princess in the past by the Duke\u2019s mother. She had not previously uttered a word to me, and I could never afterwards, despite the admonitions of the Princess and my own protestations, get out of her mind the idea that I was in some way connected with the Academician Admiral, who was a complete stranger to me. The obstinate persistence of the Princesse de Parme\u2019s lady in waiting in seeing in me a nephew of Admiral Jurien de la Gravi\u00e8re was in itself quite an ordinary form of silliness. But the mistake she made was only a crowning instance of all the other mistakes, less serious, more elaborate, unconscious or deliberate, which accompany one\u2019s name on the label which society writes out and attaches to one. I remember that a friend of the Guermantes who had expressed a keen desire to meet me gave me as the reason that I was a great friend of his cousin, Mme. de Chaussegros. \u201cShe is a charming person, she\u2019s so fond of you.\u201d I scrupulously, though quite vainly, insisted on the fact that there must be some mistake, as I did not know Mme. de Chaussegros. \u201cThen it\u2019s her sister you know; it comes to the same thing. She met you in Scotland.\u201d I had never been in Scotland, and took the futile precaution, in my honesty, of letting my informant know this. It was Mme. de Chaussegros herself who had said that she knew me, and no doubt sincerely believed it, as a result of some initial confusion, for from that time onwards she never failed to hold out her hand to me whenever she saw me. And as, after all, the world in which I moved was precisely that in which Mme. de Chaussegros moved my modesty had neither rhyme nor reason. To say that I was intimate with the Chaussegros was, literally, a mistake, but from the social point of view was to state an equivalent of my position, if one can speak of the social position of so young a man as I then was. It therefore mattered not in the least that this friend of the Guermantes should tell me only things that were false about myself, he neither lowered nor exalted me (from the worldly point of view) in the idea which he continued to hold of me. And when all is said, for those of us who are not professional actors the tedium of living always in the same character is removed for a moment, as if we were to go on the boards, when another person forms a false idea of us, imagines that we are friends with a lady whom we do not know and are reported to have met in the course of a delightful tour of a foreign country which we have never made. Errors that multiply themselves and are harmless when they have not the inflexible rigidity of this one which had been committed, and continued for the rest of her life to be committed, in spite of my denials, by the imbecile lady in waiting to Mme. de Parme, rooted for all time in the belief that I was related to the tiresome Admiral Jurien de la Gravi\u00e8re. \u201cShe is not very strong in her head,\u201d the Duke confided to me, \u201cand besides, she ought not to indulge in too many libations. I fancy, she\u2019s slightly under the influence of Bacchus.\u201d As a matter of fact Mme. de Varambon had drunk nothing but water, but the Duke liked to find scope for his favourite figures of speech. \u201cBut Zola is not a realist, Ma\u2019am, he\u2019s a poet!\u201d said Mme. de Guermantes, drawing inspiration from the critical essays which she had read in recent years and adapting them to her own personal genius. Agreeably buffeted hitherto, in the course of this bath of wit, a bath stirred for herself, which she was taking this evening and which, she considered, must be particularly good for her health, letting herself be swept away by the waves of paradox which curled and broke one after another, before this, the most enormous of them all, the Princesse de Parme jumped for fear of being knocked over. And it was in a choking voice, as though she were quite out of breath, that she now gasped: \u201cZola a poet!\u201d \u201cWhy, yes,\u201d answered the Duchess with a laugh, entranced by this display of suffocation. \u201cYour Highness must have remarked how he magnifies everything he touches. You will tell me that he touches just what \u2014 perish the thought! But he makes it into something colossal. His is the epic dungheap. He is the Homer of the sewers! He has not enough capitals to print Cambronne\u2019s word.\u201d Despite the extreme exhaustion which she was beginning to feel, the Princess was enchanted; never had she felt better. She would not have exchanged for an invitation to Schonbrunn, albeit that was the one thing that really flattered her, these divine dinner-parties at Mme. de Guermantes\u2019s, made invigorating by so liberal a dose of attic salt. \u201cHe writes it with a big C,\u201d cried Mme. d\u2019Arpajon. \u201cSurely with a big M, I think, my dear,\u201d replied Mme. de Guermantes, exchanging first with her husband a merry glance which implied: \u201cDid you ever hear such an idiot?\u201d \u201cWait a minute, now.\u201d Mme. de Guermantes turned to me, fixing on me a tender, smiling gaze, because, as an accomplished hostess, she was anxious to display her own knowledge of the artist who interested me specially, to give me, if I required it, an opportunity for exhibiting mine. \u201cWait,\u201d she urged me, gently waving her feather fan, so conscious was she at this moment that she was performing in full the duties of hospitality, and, that she might be found wanting in none of them, making a sign also to the servants to help me to more of the asparagus and mousseline sauce: \u201cwait, now, I do believe that Zola has actually written an essay on Elstir, the painter whose things you were looking at just now \u2014 the only ones of his, really, that I care for,\u201d she concluded. As a matter of fact sh hated Elstir\u2019s work, but found a unique quality in anything that was in her own house. I asked M. de Guermantes if he knew the name of the gentleman in the tall hat who figured in the picture of the crowd and whom I recognised as the same person whose portrait the Guermantes also had and had hung beside the other, both dating more or less from the same early period in which Elstir\u2019s personality was not yet completely established and he derived a certain inspiration from Manet. \u201cGood Lord, yes,\u201d he replied, \u201cI know it\u2019s a fellow who is quite well-known and no fool either in his own line, but I have no head for names. I have it on the tip of my tongue, Monsieur. . . . Monsieur. . . . oh, well, it doesn\u2019t matter, I can\u2019t remember it. Swann would be able to tell you, it was he who made Mme. de Guermantes buy all that stuff; she is always too good-natured, afraid of hurting people\u2019s feelings if she refuses to do things; between ourselves, I believe he\u2019s landed us with a lot of rubbish. What I can tell you is that the gentleman you mean has been a sort of Maecenas to M. Elstir, he started him and has often helped him out of tight places by ordering pictures from him. As a compliment to this man \u2014 if you can call that sort of thing a compliment \u2014 he has painted him standing about among that crowd, where with his Sunday-go-to-meeting look he creates a distinctly odd effect. He may be a big gun in his own way but he is evidently not aware of the proper time and place for a top hat. With that thing on his head, among all those bare-headed girls, he looks like a little country lawyer on the razzle-dazzle. But tell me, you seem quite gone on his pictures. If I had only known, I should have got up the subject properly. Not that there\u2019s any need to rack one\u2019s brains over the meaning of M. Elstir\u2019s work, as one would for Ingres\u2019s Source or the Princes in the Towier by Paul Delaroche. What one appreciates in his work is that it\u2019s shrewdly observed, amusing, Parisian, and then one passes on to the next thing. One doesn\u2019t need to be an expert to look at that sort of thing. I know of course that they\u2019re merely sketches, still, I don\u2019t feel myself that he puts enough work into them. Swann was determined that we should buy aBundle of Asparagus. In fact it was in the house for several days. There was nothing else in the picture, a bundle of asparagus exactly like what you\u2019re eating now. But I must say I declined to swallow M. Elstir\u2019s asparagus. He asked three hundred francs for them. Three hundred francs for a bundle of asparagus. A louis, that\u2019s as much as they\u2019re worth, even if they are out of season. I thought it a bit stiff. When he puts real people into his pictures as well, there\u2019s something rather caddish, something detrimental about him which does not appeal to me. I am surprised to see a delicate mind, a superior brain like yours admire that sort of thing.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know why you should say that, Basin,\u201d interrupted the Duchess, who did not like to hear people run down anything that her rooms contained. \u201cI am by no means prepared to admit that there\u2019s nothing distinguished in Elstir\u2019s pictures. You have to take it or leave it. But it\u2019s not always lacking in talent. And you must admit that the ones I bought are singularly beautiful.\u201d \u201cWell, Oriane, in that style of thing I\u2019d a thousand times rather have the little study by M. Vibert we saw at the water-colour exhibition. There\u2019s nothing much in it, if you like, you could take it in the palm of your hand, but you can see the man\u2019s clever through and through: that unwashed scarecrow of a missionary standing before the sleek prelate who is making his little dog do tricks, it\u2019s a perfect little poem of subtlety, and in fact goes really deep.\u201d \u201cI believe you know M. Elstir,\u201d the Duchess went on to me, \u201cas a man, he\u2019s quite pleasant.\u201d \u201cHe is intelligent,\u201d said the Duke; \u201cone is surprised, when one talks to him, that his painting should be so vulgar.\u201d \u201cHe is more than intelligent, he is really quite clever,\u201d said the Duchess in the confidently critical tone of a person who knew what she was talking about. \u201cDidn\u2019t he once start a portrait of you, Oriane?\u201d asked the Princesse de Parme. \u201cYes, in shrimp pink,\u201d replied Mme. de Guermantes, \u201cbut that\u2019s not going to hand his name down to posterity. It\u2019s a ghastly thing; Basin wanted to have it destroyed.\u201d This last statement was one which Mme. de Guermantes often made. But at other times her appreciation of the picture was different: \u201cI do not care for his painting, but he did once do a good portrait of me.\u201d The former of these judgments was addressed as a rule to people who spoke to the Duchess of her portrait, the other to those who did not refer to it and whom therefore she was anxious to inform of its existence. The former was inspired in her by coquetry, the latter by vanity. \u201cMake a portrait of you look ghastly! Why, then it can\u2019t be a portrait, it\u2019s a falsehood; I don\u2019t know one end of a brush from the other, but I\u2019m sure if I were to paint you, merely putting you down as I see you, I should produce a masterpiece,\u201d said the Princesse de Parme ingenuously. \u201cHe sees me probably as I see myself, without any allurements,\u201d said the Duchesse de Guermantes, with the look, melancholy, modest and coaxing, which seemed to her best calculated to make her appear different from what Elstir had portrayed. \u201cThat portrait ought to appeal to Mme. de Gallardon,\u201d said the Duke. \u201cBecause she knows nothing about pictures?\u201d asked the Princesse de Parme, who knew that Mme. de Guermantes had an infinite contempt for her cousin. \u201cBut she\u2019s a very good woman, isn\u2019t she?\u201d The Duke assumed an air of profound astonishment. \u201cWhy, Basin, don\u2019t you see the Princess is making fun of you?\u201d (The Princess had never dreamed of doing such a thing.) \u201cShe knows as well as you do that Gallardonette is an old poison,\u201d went on Mme. de Guermantes, whose vocabulary, limited as a rule to all these old expressions, was as savoury as those dishes which it is possible to come across in the delicious books of Pampille, but which have in real life become so rare, dishes where the jellies, the butter, the gravy, the quails are all genuine, permit of no alloy, where even the salt is brought specially from the salt-marshes of Brittany; from her accent, her choice of words, one felt that the basis of the Duchess\u2019s conversation came directly from Guermantes. In this way the Duchess differed profoundly from her nephew Saint-Loup, the prey of so many new ideas and expressions; it is difficult, when one\u2019s mind is troubled by the ideas of Kant and the longings of Baudelaire, to write the exquisite French of Henri IV, which meant that the very purity of the Duchess\u2019s language was a sign of limitation, and that, in her, both her intelligence and her sensibility had remained proof against all innovation. Here again, Mme. de Guermantes\u2019s mind attracted me just because of what it excluded was exactly the content of my own thoughts) and by everything which by virtue of that exclusion, it had been able to preserve, that seductive vigour of the supple bodies which no exhausting necessity to think no moral anxiety or nervous trouble has deformed. Her mind, of a formation so anterior to my own, was for me the equivalent of what had been offered me by the procession of the girls of the little band along the seashore Mme. de Guermantes offered me, domesticated and held in subjection by her natural courtesy, by the respect due to another person\u2019s intellectual worth, all the energy and charm of a cruel little girl of one of the noble families round Combray who from her childhood had been brought up in the saddle, tortured cats, gouged out the eyes of rabbits, and; albeit she had remained a pillar of virtue, might equally well have been, a good few years ago now, the most brilliant mistress of the Prince de Sagan. Only she was incapable of realising what I had sought for in her, the charm of her historic name, and the tiny quantity of it that I had found in her, a rustic survival from Guermantes. Were our relations founded upon a misunderstanding which could not fail to become manifest as soon as my homage, instead of being addressed to the relatively superior woman that she believed herself to be, should be diverted to some other woman of equal mediocrity and breathing the same unconscious charm? A misunderstanding so entirely natural, and one that will always exist between a young dreamer like myself and a woman of the world, one however that profoundly disturbs him, so long as he has not yet discovered the nature of his imaginative faculties and has not acquired his share of the inevitable disappointments which he is destined to find in people, as in the theatre, in his travels and indeed in love. M. de Guermantes having declared (following upon Elstir\u2019s asparagus and those that were brought round after the financi\u00e8re chicken) that green asparagus grown in the open air, which, as has been so quaintly said by the charming writer who signs himself E. de Clermont-Tonnerre, \u201chave not the impressive rigidity of their sisters,\u201d ought to be eaten with eggs: \u201cOne man\u2019s meat is another man\u2019s poison, as they say,\u201d replied M. de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9. \u201cIn the province of Canton, in China, the greatest delicacy that can be set before one is a dish of ortolan\u2019s eggs completely rotten.\u201d M. de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9, the author of an essay on the Mormons which had appeared in the Revue des Deux Mondes, moved in none but the most aristocratic circles, but among these visited only such as had a certain reputation for intellect, with the result that from his presence, were it at all regular, in a woman\u2019s house one could tell that she had a \u2018salon.\u2019 He pretended to a loathing of society, and assured each of his duchesses in turn that it was for the sake of her wit and beauty that he came to see her. They all believed him. Whenever, with death in his heart, he resigned himself to attending a big party at the Princesse de Parme\u2019s, he summoned them all to accompany him, to keep up his courage, and thus appeared only to be moving in the midst of an intimate group. So that his reputation as an intellectual might survive his worldly success, applying certain maxims of the Guermantes spirit, he would set out with ladies of fashion on long scientific expeditions at the height of the dancing season, and when a woman who was a snob, and consequently still without any definite position, began to go everywhere, he would put a savage obstinacy into his refusal to know her, to allow himself to be introduced to her. His hatred of snobs was a derivative of his snobbishness, but made the simpletons (in other words, everyone) believe that he was immune from snobbishness. \u201cBabal always knows everything,\u201d exclaimed the Duchesse de Guermantes. \u201cI think it must be charming, a country where you can be quite sure that your dairyman will supply you with really rotten eggs, eggs of the year of the comet. I can see myself dipping my bread and butter in them. I must say, you get the same thing at aunt Madeleine\u2019s\u201d (Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s) \u201cwhere everything\u2019s served in a state of putrefaction, eggs included.\u201d Then, as Mme. d\u2019Arpajon protested, \u201cBut my dear Phili, you know it as well as I do. You can see the chicken in the egg. What I can\u2019t understand is how they manage not to fall out. It\u2019s not an omelette you get there, it\u2019s a poultry-yard. You were so wise not to come to dinner there yesterday, there was a brill cooked in carbolic! I assure you, it wasn\u2019t a dinner-table, it was far more like an operating-table. Really, Norpois carries loyalty to the pitch of heroism. He actually asked for more!\u201d \u201cI believe I saw you at dinner there the time she made that attack on M. Bloch\u201d (M. de Guermantes, perhaps to give to an Israelite name a more foreign sound, pronounced the \u2018ch\u2019 in Bloch not like a \u2018k\u2019 but as in the German \u2018hoch\u2019) \u201cwhen he said about some poit\u201d (poet) \u201cor other that he was sublime. Ch\u00e2tellerault did his best to break M. Bloch\u2019s shins, the fellow didn\u2019t understand in the least and thought my nephew\u2019s kick was aimed at a young woman sitting opposite him.\u201d (At this point, M. de Guermantes coloured slightly.) \u201cHe did not realise that he was annoying our aunt by his \u2018sublimes\u2019 chucked about all over the place like that. In short, aunt Madeleine, who doesn\u2019t keep her tongue in her pocket, turned on him with: \u2018Indeed, Sir, and what epithet do you keep for M. de Bousset?\u2019\u201d (M. de Guermantes thought that, when one mentioned a famous name, the use of \u2018Monsieur\u2019 and a particle was eminently \u2018old school.\u2019) \u201cThat put him in his place, all right.\u201d \u201cAnd what answer did this M. Bloch make?\u201d came in a careless tone from Mme. de Guermantes, who, running short for the moment of original ideas, felt that she must copy her husband\u2019s teutonic pronunciation. \u201cAh! I can assure you, M. Bloch did not wait for any more, he\u2019s still running.\u201d \u201cYes, I remember quite well seeing you there that evening,\u201d said Mme. de Guermantes with emphasis as though, coming from her, there must be something in this reminiscence highly flattering to myself. \u201cIt is always so interesting at my aunt\u2019s. At the last party she gave, which was, of course, when I met you, I meant to ask you whether that old gentleman who went past where we were, sitting wasn\u2019t Fran\u00e7ois Copp\u00e9e. You must know who everyone is,\u201d she went on, sincerely envious of my relations with poets and poetry, and also out of \u2018consideration\u2019 for myself, the wish to establish in a better position in the eyes of her other guests a young man so well versed in literature. I assured the Duchess that I had not observed any celebrities at Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s party. \u201cWhat!\u201d she replied with a bewilderment which revealed that her respect for men of letters and her contempt for society were more superficial than she said, perhaps even than she thought, \u201cWhat! There were no famous authors there! You astonish me! Why, I saw all sorts of quite impossible people!\u201d I remembered the evening in question distinctly owing to an entirely trivial incident that had occurred at the party. Mme. de Villeparisis had introduced Bloch to Mme. Alphonse de Rothschild, but my friend had not caught the name and, thinking he was talking to an old English lady who was a trifle mad had replied only in monosyllables to the garrulous conversation of the historic beauty, when Mme. de Villeparisis in making her known to some one else uttered, quite distinctly this time: \u201cThe Baronne Alphonse de Rothschild.\u201d Thereupon there had coursed suddenly and simultaneously through Bloch\u2019s arteries so many ideas of millions and of social importance, which it would have been more prudent to subdivide and separate, that he had undergone, so to speak, a momentary failure of heart and brain alike, and cried aloud in the dear old lady\u2019s presence: \u201cIf I\u2019d only known!\u201d an exclamation the silliness of which kept him from sleeping for at least a week afterwards. His remark was of no great interest, but I remembered it as a proof that sometimes in this life, under the stress of an exceptional emotion, people do say what is in their minds. \u201cI fancy Mme. de Villeparisis is not absolutely . . . moral,\u201d said the Princesse de Parme, who knew that the best people did not visit the Duchess\u2019s aunt, and, from what the Duchess herself had just been saying, that one might speak freely about her. But, Mme. de Guermantes not seeming to approve of this criticism, she hastened to add: \u201cThough, of course, intellect carried to that degree excuses everything.\u201d \u201cBut you take the same view of my aunt that everyone else does,\u201d replied the Duchess, \u201cwhich is, really, quite mistaken. It\u2019s just what M\u00e9m\u00e9 was saying to me only yesterday.\u201d She blushed; a reminiscence unknown to me filmed her eyes. I formed the supposition that M. de Charlus had asked her to cancel my invitation, as he had sent Robert to ask me not to go to her house. I had the impression that the blush \u2014 equally incomprehensible to me \u2014 which had tinged the Duke\u2019s cheek when he made some reference to his brother could not be attributed to the same cause. \u201cMy poor aunt \u2014 she will always have the reputation of being a lady of the old school, of sparkling wit and uncontrolled passions. And really there\u2019s no more middle-class, serious, commonplace mind in Paris. She will go down as a patron of the arts, which means to say that she was once the mistress of a great painter, though he was never able to make her understand what a picture was; and as for her private life, so far from being a depraved woman, she was so much made for marriage, so conjugal from her cradle that, not having succeeded in keeping a husband, who incidentally was a cad, she has never had a love-affair which she hasn\u2019t taken just as seriously as if it were holy matrimony, with the same susceptibilities, the same quarrels, the same fidelity. By which token, those relations are often the most sincere; you\u2019ll find, in fact, more inconsolable lovers than husbands.\u201d \u201cYet, Oriane, if you take the case of your brother-in-law Palam\u00e8de you were speaking about just now; no mistress in the world could ever dream of being mourned as that poor Mme. de Charlus has been.\u201d \u201cAh!\u201d replied the Duchess, \u201cYour Highness must permit me to be not altogether of her opinion. People don\u2019t all like to be mourned in the same way, each of us has his preferences.\u201d \u201cStill, he did make a regular cult of her after her death. It is true that people sometimes do for the dead what they would not have done for the living.\u201d \u201cFor one thing,\u201d retorted Mme. de Guermantes in a dreamy tone which belied her teasing purpose, \u201cwe go to their funerals, which we never do for the living!\u201d M. de Guermantes gave a sly glance at M. de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9 as though to provoke him into laughter at the Duchess\u2019s wit. \u201cAt the same time I frankly admit,\u201d went on Mme. de Guermantes, \u201cthat the manner in which I should like to be mourned by a man I loved would not be that adopted by my brother-in-law.\u201d The Duke\u2019s face darkened. He did not like to hear his wife utter rash judgments, especially about M. de Charlus. \u201cYou are very particular. His grief set an example to everyone,\u201d he reproved her stiffly. But the Duchess had in dealing with her husband that sort of boldness which animal tamers shew, or people who live with a madman and are not afraid of making him angry. \u201cOh, very well, just as you like \u2014 he does set an example, I never said he didn\u2019t, he goes every day to the cemetery to tell her how many people he has had to luncheon, he misses her enormously, but \u2014 as he\u2019d mourn for a cousin, a grandmother, a sister. It is not the grief of a husband. It is true that they were a pair of saints, which makes it all rather exceptional.\u201d M. de Guermantes, infuriated by his wife\u2019s chatter, fixed on her with a terrible immobility a pair of eyes already loaded. \u201cI don\u2019t wish to say anything against poor M\u00e9m\u00e9, who, by the way, could not come this evening,\u201d went on the Duchess, \u201cI quite admit there\u2019s no one like him, he\u2019s delightful; he has a delicacy, a warmth of heart that you don\u2019t as a rule find in men. He has a woman\u2019s heart, M\u00e9m\u00e9 has!\u201d \u201cWhat you say is absurd,\u201d M. de Guermantes broke in sharply. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing effeminate about M\u00e9m\u00e9, I know nobody so manly as he is.\u201d \u201cBut I am not suggesting that he\u2019s the least bit in the world effeminate. Do at least take the trouble to understand what I say,\u201d retorted the Duchess. \u201cHe\u2019s always like that the moment anyone mentions his brother,\u201d she added, turning to the Princesse de Parme. \u201cIt\u2019s very charming, it\u2019s a pleasure to hear him. There\u2019s nothing so nice as two brothers who are fond of each other,\u201d replied the Princess, as many a humbler person might have replied, for it is possible to belong to a princely race by birth and at the same time to be mentally affiliated to a race that is thoroughly plebeian\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAs we\u2019re discussing your family, Oriane,\u201d said the Princess, \u201cI saw your nephew Saint-Loup yesterday; I believe he wants to ask you to do something for him.\u201d The Duc de Guermantes bent his Olympian brow. When he did not himself care to do a service, he preferred his wife not to assume the responsibility for it, knowing that it would come to the same thing in the end and that the people to whom the Duchess would be obliged to apply would put this concession down to the common account of the household, just as much as if it had been asked of them by the husband alone. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t he tell me about it himself?\u201d said the Duchess. \u201cHe was here yesterday and stayed a couple of hours, and heaven only knows what a bore he managed to make himself. He would be no stupider than anyone else if he had only the sense, like many people we know, to be content with being a fool. It\u2019s his veneer of knowledge that\u2019s so terrible. He wants to preserve an open mind \u2014 open to all the things he doesn\u2019t understand. He talks to you about Morocco. It\u2019s appalling.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHe can\u2019t go back there, because of Rachel,\u201d said the Prince de Foix \u201cSurely, now that they\u2019ve broken it off,\u201d interrupted M. de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9. \u201cSo far from breaking it off, I found her a couple of days ago in Robert\u2019s rooms, they didn\u2019t look at all like people who\u2019d quarrelled, I can assure you,\u201d replied the Prince de Foix, who loved to spread abroad every rumour that could damage Robert\u2019s chances of marrying, and might for that matter have been misled by one of the intermittent resumptions of a connexion that was practically at an end\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThat Rachel was speaking to me about you, I see her like that in the mornings, on the way to the Champs-Elys\u00e9es; she\u2019s a kind of head-in-air, as you say, what you call \u2018unlaced,\u2019 a sort of \u2018Dame aux Cam\u00e9lias,\u2019 only figuratively speaking, of course.\u201d This speech was addressed to me by Prince Von, who liked always to appear conversant with French literature and Parisian catchwords\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhy, that\u2019s just what it was \u2014 Morocco!\u201d exclaimed the Princess, flinging herself into this opening. \u201cWhat on earth can he want in Morocco?\u201d asked M. de Guermantes sternly; \u201cOriane can do absolutely nothing for him there, as he knows perfectly well.\u201d \u201cHe thinks he invented strategy,\u201d Mme. de Guermantes pursued the theme, \u201cand then he uses impossible words for the most trivial things, which doesn\u2019t prevent him from making blots all over his letters. The other day he announced that he\u2019d been given some sublime potatoes, and that he\u2019d taken a sublime stage box.\u201d \u201cHe speaks Latin,\u201d the Duke went one better. \u201cWhat! Latin?\u201d the Princesse gasped. \u201c\u2018Pon my soul he does! Ma\u2019am can ask Oriane if I\u2019m not telling the truth.\u201d \u201cWhy, of course, Ma\u2019am; the other day he said to us straight out, without stopping to think: \u2018I know of no more touching example of sic transit gloria mundi.\u2019 I can repeat the phrase now to your Highness because, after endless inquiries and by appealing to linguists, we succeeded in reconstructing it, but Robert flung it out without pausing for breath, one could hardly make out that there was Latin in it, he was just like a character in the Malade Imaginaire. And all this referred simply to the death of the Empress of Austria!\u201d \u201cPoor woman!\u201d cried the Princess, \u201cwhat a delicious creature she was.\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d replied the Duchess, \u201ca trifle mad, a trifle headstrong, but she was a thoroughly good woman, a nice, kind-hearted lunatic; the only thing I could never make out about her was why she had never managed to get her teeth made to fit her; they always came loose half-way through a sentence and she was obliged to stop short or she\u2019d have swallowed them.\u201d \u201cThat Rachel was speaking to me about you, she told me that young Saint-Loup worshipped you, that he was fonder of you than he was of her,\u201d said Prince Von to me, devouring his food like an ogre as he spoke, his face scarlet, his teeth bared by his perpetual grin. \u201cBut in that case she must be jealous of me and hate me,\u201d said I. \u201cNot at all, she told me all sorts of nice things about you. The Prince de Foix\u2019s mistress would perhaps be jealous if he preferred you to her. You don\u2019t understand? Come home with me, and I\u2019ll explain it all to you.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t, I\u2019m going on to M. de Charlus at eleven.\u201d \u201cWhy, he sent round to me yesterday to ask me to dine with him this evening, but told me not to come after a quarter to eleven. But if you must go to him, at least come with me as far as the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Fran\u00e7ais, you will be in the periphery,\u201d said the Prince, who thought doubtless that this last word meant \u2018proximity\u2019 or possibly \u2018centre.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But the bulging eyes in his coarse though handsome red face frightened me and I declined, saying that a friend was coming to call for me. This reply seemed to me in no way offensive. The Prince, however, apparently formed a different impression of it for he did not say another word to me\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI really must go and see the Queen of Naples; what a grief it must be to her,\u201d said (or at least appeared to me to have said) the Princesse de Parme. For her words had come to me only indistinctly through the intervening screen of those addressed to me, albeit in an undertone, by Prince Von, who had doubtless been afraid, if he spoke louder, of being overheard by the Prince de Foix. \u201cOh, dear, no!\u201d replied the Duchess, \u201cI don\u2019t believe it has been any grief at all.\u201d \u201cNone at all! You do always fly to extremes so, Oriane,\u201d said M. de Guermantes, resuming his part of the cliff which by standing up to the wave forces it to fling higher its crest of foam. \u201cBasin knows even better than I that I\u2019m telling the truth,\u201d replied the Duchess, \u201cbut he thinks he\u2019s obliged to look severe because you are present, Ma\u2019am, and he\u2019s afraid of my shocking you.\u201d \u201cOh, please, no, I beg of you,\u201d cried the Princesse de Parme, dreading the slightest alteration on her account of these delicious Fridays at the Duchesse de Guermantes\u2019s, this forbidden fruit which the Queen of Sweden herself had not yet acquired the right to taste. \u201cWhy, it was Basin himself that she told, when he said to her with a duly sorrowful expression: \u2018But the Queen is in mourning; for whom, pray, is it a great grief to your Majesty?\u2019\u2014\u2018No, it\u2019s not a deep mourning, it\u2019s a light mourning, quite a light mourning, it\u2019s my sister.\u2019 The truth is, she\u2019s delighted about it, as Basin knows perfectly well, she invited us to a party that very evening, and gave me two pearls. I wish she could lose a sister every day! So far from weeping for her sister\u2019s death, she was in fits of laughter over it. She probably says to herself, like Robert, \u2018sic transit \u2014\u2014\u2019 I forget how it goes on,\u201d she added modestly, knowing how it went on perfectly well\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In saying all this Mme. de Guermantes was only being witty, and with complete insincerity, for the Queen of Naples, like the Duchesse d\u2019Alen\u00e7on, also doomed to a tragic fate, had the warmest heart in the world and mourned quite sincerely for her kinsfolk. Mme. de Guermantes knew those noble Bavarian sisters, her cousins, too well not to be aware of this. \u201cHe would like not to go back to Morocco,\u201d said the Princesse de Parme, alighting hurriedly again upon the perch of Robert\u2019s name which had been held out to her, quite unintentionally, by Mme. de Guermantes. \u201cI believe you know General de Monserfeuil.\u201d \u201cVery slightly,\u201d replied the Duchess, who was an intimate friend of the officer in question. The Princess explained what it was that Saint-Loup wanted. \u201cGood gracious, yes, if I see him \u2014 it is possible that I may meet him,\u201d the Duchess replied, so as not to appear to be refusing, the occasions of her meeting General de Monserfeuil seeming to extend rapidly farther apart as soon as it became a question of her asking him for anything. This uncertainty did not, however, satisfy the Duke, who interrupted his wife: \u201cYou know perfectly well you won\u2019t seeing him, Oriane, and besides you have already asked him for two thing which he hasn\u2019t done. My wife has a passion for doing good turns to people,\u201d he went on, growing more and more furious, in order to force the Princess to withdraw her request, without there being any question made of his wife\u2019s good nature and so that Mme. de Parme should throw the blame back upon his own character, which was essentially obstructive. \u201cRobert could get anything he wanted out of Monserfeuil. Only, as he happens not to know himself what he wants, he gets us to ask for it because he knows there\u2019s no better way of making the whole thing fall through. Oriane has asked too many favours of Monserfeuil. A request from her now would be a reason for him to refuse.\u201d \u201cOh, in that case, it would be better if the Duchess did nothing,\u201d said Mme. de Parme\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cObviously!\u201d the Duke closed the discussion. \u201cPoor General, he\u2019s been defeated again at the elections,\u201d said the Princess, so as to turn the conversation from Robert. \u201cOh, it\u2019s nothing serious, it\u2019s only the seventh time,\u201d said the Duke, who, having been obliged himself to retire from politics, quite enjoyed hearing of other people\u2019s failures at the polls. \u201cHe has consoled himself by giving his wife another baby.\u201d \u201cWhat! Is that poor Mme. de Monserfeuil in an interesting condition again?\u201d cried the Princess\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhy, of course,\u201d replied the Duke, \u201cthat\u2019s the one division where the poor General has never failed to get in.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the period that followed I was continually to be invited, were it with a small party only, to these repasts at which I had at one time imagined the guests as seated like the Apostles in the Sainte-Chapelle. They did assemble there indeed, like the early Christians, not to partake merely of a material nourishment, which incidentally was exquisite, but in a sort of social Eucharist; so that in the course of a few dinner-parties I assimilated the acquaintance of all the friends of my hosts, friends to whom they presented me with a shade of benevolent patronage so marked (as a person for whom they had always had a sort of parental affection) that there was not one among them who would not have felt himself to be failing in his duty to the Duke and Duchess if he had given a ball without including my name on his list, and at the same time, while I sipped one of those Yquems which lay concealed in the Guermantes cellars, I tasted ortolans dressed according to each of the different recipes which the Duke himself used to elaborate and modified with prudence. However, for one who had already set his knees more than once beneath the mystic board, the consumption of the latter was not indispensable. Old friends of M. and Mme. de Guermantes came in to see them after dinner, \u2018with the tooth-picks,\u2019 as Mme. Swann would have said, without being expected, and took in winter a cup of tilleul in the lighted warmth of the great drawing-room, in summer a glass of orangeade in the darkness of the little rectangular strip of garden outside. There was no record of anything else, among the Guermantes, in these evenings in the garden, but orangeade. It had a sort of ritual meaning. To have added other refreshments would have seemed to be falsifying the tradition, just as a big at-home in the Faubourg Saint-Germain ceases to be an at-home if there is a play also, or music. You must be supposed to have come simply \u2014 though there be five hundred of you \u2014 to pay a call on, let us say, the Princesse de Guermantes. People marvelled at my influence because I was able to procure the addition to this orangeade of a jug containing the juice of stewed cherries or stewed pears. I took a dislike on this account to the Prince d\u2019Agrigente, who was like all the people who, lacking in imagination but not in covetousness, take a keen interest in what one is drinking and ask if they may taste a little of it themselves. Which meant that, every time, M. d\u2019Agrigente, by diminishing my ration, spoiled my pleasure. For this fruit juice can never be provided in sufficient quantities to quench one\u2019s thirst for it. Nothing is less cloying than these transpositions into flavour of the colour of a fruit which when cooked seems to have travelled backwards to the past season of its blossoming. Blushing like an orchard in spring, or, it may be, colourless and cool like the zephyr beneath the fruit-trees, the juice lets itself be breathed and gazed into one drop by drop, and M. d\u2019Agrigente prevented me, regularly, from taking my fill of it. Despite these distillations the traditional orangeade persisted like the tilleul. In these humble kinds, the social communion was none the less administered. In this respect, doubtless, the friends of M. and Mme. de Guermantes had, after all, as I had originally imagined, remained more different from the rest of humanity than their outward appearance might have misled me into supposing. Numbers of elderly men came to receive from the Duchess, together with the invariable drink, a welcome that was often far from cordial. Now this could not have been due to snobbishness, they themselves being of a rank to which there was none superior; nor to love of splendour; they did love it perhaps, but on less stringent social conditions might have been enjoying a glittering example of it, for on these same evenings the charming wife of a colossally rich financier would have given anything in the world to have them among the brilliant shooting-party she was giving for a couple of days for the King of Spain. They had nevertheless declined her invitation, and had come round without fail to inquire whether Mme. de Guermantes was at home. They were not even certain of finding there opinions that conformed entirely with their own, or sentiments of any great warmth; Mme. de Guermantes let fall now and then, on the Dreyfus case, on the Republic, the Laws against Religion, or even in an undertone on themselves, their weaknesses, the dullness of their conversation, comments which they had to appear not to notice. No doubt, if they kept up their habit of coming there, it was owing to their superfine training as epicures in things worldly, to their clear consciousness of the prime and perfect quality of the social dish, with its familiar, reassuring, sappy savour, free from blend or taint, with the origin and history of which they were as well aware as she who served them with it, remaining more \u2018noble\u2019 in this respect than they themselves imagined. Now, on this occasion, among the visitors to whom I was introduced after dinner, it so happened that there was that General de Monserfeuil of whom the Princesse de Parme had been speaking, while Mme. de Guermantes, of whose drawing-room he was one of the regular frequenters, had not known that he was going to be there that evening. He bowed before me, on hearing my name, as though I had been the President of the Supreme War Council. I had supposed it to be simply from some deep-rooted unwillingness to oblige, in which the Duke, as in wit if not in love, was his wife\u2019s accomplice, that the Duchess had practically refused to recommend her nephew to M. de Monserfeuil. And I saw in this an indifference all the more blameworthy in that I seemed to have gathered from a few words let fall by the Princess that Robert was in a post of danger from which it would be prudent to have him removed. But it was by the genuine malice of Mme. de Guermantes that I was revolted when, the Princesse de Parme having timidly suggested that she might say something herself and on her own responsibility to the General, the Duchess did everything in her power to dissuade her. \u201cBut Ma\u2019am,\u201d she cried, \u201cMonserfeuil has no sort of standing or influence whatever with the new Government. You would be wasting your breath.\u201d \u201cI think he can hear us,\u201d murmured the Princess, as a hint to the Duchess not to speak so loud. Without lowering her voice: \u201cYour Highness need not be afraid, he\u2019s as deaf as a post,\u201d said the Duchess, every word reaching the General distinctly. \u201cThe thing is, I believe M. de Saint-Loup is in a place that is not very safe,\u201d said the Princess. \u201cWhat is one to do?\u201d replied the Duchess. \u201cHe\u2019s in the same boat as everybody else, the only difference being that it was he who originally asked to be sent there. Besides, no, it\u2019s not really dangerous; if it was, you can imagine how anxious I should be to help. I, should have spoken to Saint-Joseph about it during dinner. He has far more influence, and he\u2019s a real worker. But, as you see, he\u2019s gone now. Still, asking him would be less awkward than going to this one, who has; three of his sons in Morocco just now and has refused to apply for them to be exchanged; he might raise that as an objection. Since your Highness insists on it, I shall speak to Saint-Joseph \u2014 if I see him again, or to Beautreillis. But if I don\u2019t see either of them, you mustn\u2019t waste your pity on Robert. It was explained to us the other day exactly where he is. I\u2019m sure he couldn\u2019t wish for a better place.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat a pretty flower, I\u2019ve never seen one like it; there\u2019s no one like you, Oriane, for having such marvellous things in your house,\u201d said the Princesse de Parme, who, fearing that General de Monserfeuil might have overheard the Duchess, sought now to change the conversation. I looked and recognised a plant of the sort that I had watched Elstir painting. \u201cI am so glad you like them; they are charming, do look at their little purple velvet collars; the only thing against them is \u2014 as may happen with people who are very pretty and very nicely dressed \u2014 they have a hideous name and a horrid smell. In spite of which I am very fond of them. But what is rather sad is that they are dying.\u201d \u201cBut they\u2019re growing in a pot, they aren\u2019t cut flowers,\u201d said the Princess. \u201cNo,\u201d answered the Duchess with a smile, \u201cbut it comes to the same thing, as they\u2019re all ladies. It\u2019s a kind of plant where the ladies and the gentlemen don\u2019t both grow on the same stalk. I\u2019m like people who keep a lady dog. I have to find a husband for my flowers. Otherwise I shan\u2019t have any young ones!\u201d \u201cHow very strange. Do you mean to say that in nature . . .?\u201d \u201cYes! There are certain insects whose duty it is to bring about the marriage, as they do with Sovereigns, by proxy, without the bride and bridegroom ever having set eyes on one another. And so, I assure you, I always tell my man to put my plant out in the window as often as possible, on the courtyard side and the garden side turn about, in the hope that the necessary insect will arrive. But the odds are too great. Fancy, he has first to have been seen by a person of the same species and the opposite sex, and he must then have taken it into his head to come and leave cards at the house. He hasn\u2019t appeared so far, I believe my plant can still qualify for the white flower of a blameless life, but I must say a little immodesty would please me better. It\u2019s just the same with that fine tree we have in the courtyard; he will die childless because he belongs to a kind that\u2019s very rare in these latitudes. In his case, it\u2019s the wind that\u2019s responsible for consummating the marriage, but the wall is a trifle high.\u201d \u201cBy Jove, yes,\u201d said M. de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9, \u201cyou ought to take just a couple of inches off the top, that will be quite enough. There are certain operations one ought to know how to perform. The flavour of vanilla we tasted in the excellent ice you gave us this evening, Duchess, comes from a plant called the vanilla tree. This plant produces flowers which are both male and female, but a sort of solid wall set up between them prevents any communication. And so we could never get any fruit from them until a young Negro, a native of R\u00e9union, by the name of Albins, which by the way is rather an odd name for a black man since it means \u2018white,\u2019 had the happy thought of using the point of a needle to bring the separate organs into contact.\u201d \u201cBabal, you\u2019re divine, you know everything,\u201d cried the Duchess. \u201cBut you yourself, Oriane, have told me things I had no idea of,\u201d the Princesse de Parme assured her. \u201cI must explain to your Highness that it is Swann who has always talked to me all about botany. Sometimes when we were too bored to go to a tea-party or a concert we would set off for the country, and he would shew me extraordinary marriages between flowers, which was far more amusing than going to human marriages \u2014 no wedding-breakfast and no crowd in the sacristy. We never had time to go very far. Now that motor-cars have come in, it Would be delightful. Unfortunately, in the interval he himself has made an even more astonishing marriage, which makes everything very difficult. Oh, Ma\u2019am, life is a dreadful business, we spend our whole time doing things that bore us, and when by mere chance we come across somebody with whom we could go and look at something really interesting, he has to make a marriage like Swann\u2019s. Faced with the alternatives of giving up my botanical expeditions and being obliged to call upon a degrading person, I chose the former calamity. Besides, when it comes to that, there was no need to go quite so far. It seems that here, in my own little bit of garden, more odd things happen in broad daylight than at midnight \u2014 in the Bois de Boulogne! Only they attract no attention, because among flowers it\u2019s all done quite simply, you see a little orange shower, or else a very dusty fly coming to wipe its feet or take a bath before crawling into a flower. And that does the trick!\u201d \u201cThe cabinet the plant is standing on is splendid, too; it\u2019s Empire, I think,\u201d said the Princess, who, not being familiar with the works of Darwin and his followers, was unable to grasp the point of the Duchess\u2019s pleasantries. \u201cIt\u2019s lovely, isn\u2019t it? I\u2019m so glad Ma\u2019am likes it,\u201d replied the Duchess, \u201cit\u2019s a magnificent piece. I must tell you that I\u2019ve always adored the Empire style, even when it wasn\u2019t in fashion. I remember at Guermantes I got into terrible disgrace with my mother-in-law because I told them to bring down from the attics all the splendid Empire furniture Basin had inherited from the Montesquious, and used it to furnish the wing we lived in.\u201d M. de Guermantes smiled. He must nevertheless have remembered that the course of events had been totally different. But, the witticisms of the Princesse des Laumes at the expense of her mother-in-law\u2019s bad taste having been a tradition during the short time in which the Prince was in love with his wife, his love for the latter had been outlasted by a certain contempt for the intellectual inferiority of the former, a contempt which, however, went hand in hand with a considerable attachment and respect. \u201cThe I\u00e9nas have the same armchair with Wedgwood medallions, it\u2019s a lovely thing, but I prefer my own;\u201d said the Duchess, with the same air of impartiality as if she had been the possessor of neither of the articles under discussion. \u201cI know, of course, that they\u2019ve some marvellous things which I haven\u2019t got.\u201d The Princesse de Parme remained silent. \u201cBut it\u2019s quite true; your Highness hasn\u2019t seen their collection. Oh, you ought really to come there one day with me, it\u2019s one of the most magnificent things in Paris. You\u2019d say it was a museum come to life.\u201d And since this suggestion was one of the most \u2018Guermantes\u2019 of the Duchess\u2019s audacities, inasmuch as the l\u00e9nas were for the Princesse de Parme rank usurpers, their son bearing like her own the title of Duc de Guastalla, Mme. de Guermantes in thus launching it could not refrain (so far did the love that she bore for her own originality prevail over the deference due to the Princesse de Parme) from casting at her other guests a smiling glance of amusement. They too made an effort to smile, at once frightened, bewildered, and above all delighted to think that they were being ear-witnesses of Oriane\u2019s very \u2018latest\u2019 and could carry it away with them \u2018red hot.\u2019 They were only half shocked, knowing that the Duchess had the knack of strewing the ground with all the Courvoisier prejudices to achieve a vital success more thrilling and more enjoyable. Had she not, within the last few years, brought together Princesse Mathilde and that Due d\u2019Aumale who had written to the Princess\u2019s own brother the famous letter: \u201cIn my family all the men are brave and the women chaste\u201d? And inasmuch as Princes remain princely even at those moments when they appear anxious to forget that they are, the Due d\u2019Aumale and Princesse Mathilde had enjoyed themselves so greatly at Mme. de Guermantes\u2019s that they had thereafter formed a defensive alliance, with that faculty for forgetting the past which Louis XVIII shewed when he took as his Minister Fouch\u00e9, who had voted the death of his brother. Mme. de Guermantes was now nourishing a similar project of arranging a meeting between Princesse Mur\u00e2t and the Queen of Naples. In the meantime, the Princesse de Parme appeared as embarrassed as might have been the heirs-apparent to the Thrones of the Netherlands and Belgium, styled respectively Prince of Orange and Duke of Brabant, had one offered to present to them M. de Mailly Nesle, Prince d\u2019Orange, and M. de Charlus, Due de Brabant. But, before anything further could happen, the Duchess, whom Swann and M. de Charlus between them (albeit the latter was resolute in ignoring the l\u00e9nas\u2019 existence) had with great difficulty succeeded in making admire the Empire style, exclaimed: \u201cHonestly, Ma\u2019am, I can\u2019t tell you how beautiful you will think it! I must confess that the Empire style has always had a fascination for me. But at the l\u00e9nas\u2019 it is really like a hallucination. That sort of \u2014 what shall I say \u2014 reflux from the Expedition to Egypt, and also the sweep forward into our own times from Antiquity, all those things that invade our houses, the Sphinxes that come to crouch at the feet of the sofas, the serpents coiled round candelabra, a huge Muse who holds out a little torch for you to play at bouillotte, or has quietly climbed on to the mantelpiece and is leaning against your clock; and then all the Pompeian lamps, the little boat-shaped beds which look as if they had been found floating on the Nile so that you expect to see Moses climb out of them, the classical chariots galloping along the bed tables. . . . \u201d \u201cThey\u2019re not very comfortable to sit in, those Empire chairs,\u201d the Princess ventured. \u201cNo,\u201d the Duchess agreed, \u201cbut,\u201d she at once added, insisting on the point with a smile: \u201cI like being uncomfortable on those mahogany seats covered with ruby velvet or green silk. I like that discomfort of the warrior who understands nothing but the curule chair and in the middle of his principal drawing-room crosses his fasces and piles his laurels. I can assure you that at the I\u00e9nas\u2019 one doesn\u2019t stop to think for a moment of how comfortable one is, when one sees in front of one a great strapping wench of a Victory painted in fresco on the wall. My husband is going to say that I\u2019m a very bad Royalist, but I\u2019m terribly disaffected, as you know, I can assure you that in those people\u2019s house one comes to love all the big N\u2019s and all the bees. Good gracious, after all for a good many years under our Kings we weren\u2019t exactly surfeited with glory, and so these warriors who brought home so many crowns that they stuck them even on the arms of the chairs, I must say I think it\u2019s all rather fetching! Your Highness ought really.\u201d \u201cWhy, my dear, if you think so,\u201d said the Princess, \u201cbut it seems to me that it won\u2019t be easy.\u201d \u201cBut Ma\u2019am will find that it will all go quite smoothly. They are very good people, and no fools. We took Mme. de Chevreuse there,\u201d added the Duchess, knowing the force of this example, \u201cshe was enchanted. The son is really very pleasant. I\u2019m going to say something that\u2019s not quite proper,\u201d she went on, \u201cbut he has a bedroom, and more especially a bed in it, in which I should love to sleep \u2014 without him! What is even less proper is that I went to see him once when he was ill and lying in it. By his side on the frame of the bed was moulded a long Siren, stretched out at full length, a lovely thing with a mother-of-pearl tail and some sort of lotus flowers in her hand. I assure you,\u201d went on Mme. de Guermantes, reducing the speed of her utterances to bring into even bolder relief the words which she had the air of modelling with the pout of her fine lips, drawing them out with her long expressive hands, directing on the Princess as she spoke a gentle, steady and searching gaze, \u201cthat with the palms and the golden crown at the side, it was most moving, it was just the arrangement of Gustave Moreau\u2019s Death and the Young Man (your Highness must know that great work, of course).\u201d The Princesse de Parme, who did not know so much as the painter\u2019s name, made violent movements with her head and smiled ardently, in order to manifest her admiration for his picture. But the intensity of her mimicry could not fill the place of that light which is absent from our eyes so long as we do not understand what people are trying to tell us. \u201cA good-looking boy, I believe?\u201d she asked. \u201cNo for he\u2019s just like a tapir. The eyes are a little those of a Queen Hortense on a screen. But he has probably come to the conclusion that it is rather absurd for a man to develop such a resemblance, and it is lost in the encaustic surface of his cheeks which give him really rather a Mameluke appearance. You feel that the polisher must call round every morning. Swann,\u201d she went on, reverting to the bed of the young Duke, \u201cwas struck by the resemblance between this Siren and Gustave Moreau\u2019s Death. But apart from that,\u201d she added, her speech becoming more rapid though still serious, so as to provoke more laughter, \u201cthere was nothing really that could strike us, for it was only a cold in the head, and the young man made a marvellous recovery.\u201d \u201cThey say he\u2019s a snob?\u201d put in M. de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9, with a malicious twinkle, expecting to be answered with the same precision as though he had said: \u201cThey tell me that he has only four fingers on his right hand; is that so?\u201d \u201cG\u2014 ood g \u2014 racious, n \u2014 o,\u201d replied Mme. de Guermantes with a smile of benign indulgence. \u201cPerhaps just the least little bit of a snob in appearance, because he\u2019s extremely young, but I should be surprised to hear that he was really, for he\u2019s intelligent,\u201d she added, as though there were to her mind some absolute incompatibility between snobbishness and intelligence. \u201cHe has wit, too, I\u2019ve known him to be quite amusing,\u201d she said again, laughing with the air of an epicure and expert, as though the act of declaring that a person could be amusing demanded a certain expression of merriment from the speaker, or as though the Duc de Guastalla\u2019s sallies were recurring to her mind as she spoke. \u201cAnyway, as he never goes anywhere, he can\u2019t have much field for his snobbishness,\u201d she wound up, forgetting that this was hardly encouraging the Princesse de Parme to make overtures. \u201cI cannot help wondering what the Prince de Guermantes, who calls her Mme. I\u00e9na, will say if he hears that I\u2019ve been to see her.\u201d \u201cWhat!\u201d cried the Duchess with extraordinary vivacity. \u201cDon\u2019t you know that it was we who gave up to Gilbert\u201d (she bitterly regretted that surrender now) \u201ca complete card-room done in the Empire style which came to us from Quiou-Quiou, and is an absolute marvel! There was no room for it here, though I think it would look better here than it does with him. It\u2019s a thing of sheer beauty, half Etruscan, half Egyptian. . . . \u201d \u201cEgyptian?\u201d queried the Princess, to whom the word Etruscan conveyed little. \u201cWell, really, you know, a little of both. Swann told us that, he explained it all to me, only you know I\u2019m such a dunce. But then, Ma\u2019am, what one has to bear in mind is that the Egypt of the Empire cabinetmakers has nothing to do with the historical Egypt, nor their Roman with the Romans nor their Etruria. . . . \u201d \u201cIndeed,\u201d said the Princess. \u201cNo, it\u2019s like what they used to call a Louis XV costume under the Second Empire, when Anna de Monchy and dear Brigode\u2019s mother were girls. Basin was talking to you just now about Beethoven. We heard a thing of his played the other day which was really quite good, though a little stiff, with a Russian theme in it. It\u2019s pathetic to think that he believed it to be Russian. In the same way as the Chinese painters believed they were copying Bellini. Besides, even in the same country, whenever anybody begins to look at things in a way that is slightly novel, nine hundred and ninety-nine people out of a thousand are totally incapable of seeing what he puts before them. It takes at least forty years before they can manage to make it out.\u201d \u201cForty years!\u201d the Princess cried in alarm. \u201cWhy, yes,\u201d went on the Duchess, adding more and more to her words (which were practically my own, for I had just been expressing a similar idea to her), thanks to her way of pronouncing them, the equivalent of what on the printed page is called italics: \u201cit\u2019s like a sort of first isolated individual of a species which does not yet exist but is going to multiply in the future, an individual endowed with a kind of sense which the human race of his generation does not possess. I can hardly give myself as an instance because I, on the contrary, have always loved any interesting production from the very start, however novel it might be. But really, the other day I was with the Grand Duchess in the Louvre and we happened to pass before Manet\u2019s Olympia. Nowadays nobody is in the least surprised by it. It looks just like an Ingres! And yet, heaven only knows how many spears I\u2019ve had to break for that picture, which I don\u2019t altogether like but which is unquestionably the work of somebody.\u201d \u201cAnd is the Grand Duchess well?\u201d inquired the Princesse de Parme, to whom the Tsar\u2019s aunt was infinitely more familiar than Manet\u2019s model. \u201cYes; we talked about you. After all,\u201d she resumed, clinging to her idea, \u201cthe fact of the matter is, as my brother-in-law Palam\u00e8de always says, that one has between oneself and the rest of the world the barrier of a strange language. Though I admit that there\u2019s no one it\u2019s quite so true of as Gilbert. If it amuses you to go to the I\u00e9nas\u2019, you have far too much sense to let your actions be governed by what that poor fellow may think, who is a dear, innocent creature, but really lives in a different world. I feel myself nearer, more akin to my coachman, my horses even, than to a man who keeps on harking back to what people would have thought under Philip the Bold or Louis the Fat. Just fancy, when he goes for a walk in the country, he takes a stick to drive the peasants out of his way, quite in a friendly spirit, saying: \u2018Get on, clowns!\u2019 Really, I\u2019m just as much surprised when he speaks to me as if I heard myself addressed by one of the \u2018recumbents\u2019 on the old gothic tombs. It\u2019s all very well that animated gravestone\u2019s being my cousin; he frightens me, and the only idea that comes into my head is to let him stay in his Middle Ages. Apart from that, I quite admit that he\u2019s never assassinated anyone.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve just been seeing him at dinner at Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s,\u201d said the General, but without either smiling at or endorsing the Duchess\u2019s pleasantries. \u201cWas M. de Norpois there?\u201d asked Prince Von, whose mind still ran on the Academy of Moral Sciences. \u201cWhy, yes;\u201d said the General. \u201cIn fact, he was talking about your Emperor.\u201d \u201cIt seems, the Emperor William is highly intelligent, but he does not care for Elstir\u2019s painting. Not that I\u2019m saying this against him,\u201d said the Duchess, \u201cI quite share his point of view. Although Elstir has done a fine portrait of me. You don\u2019t know it? It\u2019s not in the least like me, but it\u2019s a remarkable piece of work. He is interesting while one\u2019s sitting to him. He has made me like a little old woman It\u2019s after the style of the Regents of the Hospital, by Hals. I expect you know those sublimities, to borrow my nephew\u2019s favourite expression,\u201d the Duchess turned to myself, gently flapping her fan of black feathers. More than erect on her chair, she flung her head nobly backwards, for, while always a great lady, she was a trifle inclined to play the great lady also. I said that I had been once to Amsterdam and The Hague, but that to avoid confusing my mind, as my time was limited, I had left out Haarlem. \u201cAh! The Hague! What a gallery!\u201d cried M. de Guermantes. I said to him that he had doubtless admired Vermeer\u2019s Street in Delft. But the Duke was less erudite than arrogant. Accordingly he contented himself with replying in a tone of sufficiency, as was his habit whenever anyone spoke to him of a picture in a gallery, or in the Salon, which he did not remember having seen. \u201cIf it\u2019s to be seen, I saw it!\u201d \u201cWhat? You\u2019ve been to Holland, and you never visited Haarlem!\u201d cried the Duchess. \u201cWhy, even if you had only a quarter of an hour to spend in the place, they\u2019re an extraordinary thing to have seen, those Halses. I don\u2019t mind saying that a person who only caught a passing glimpse of them from the top of a tramway-car without stopping, supposing they were hung out to view in the street, would open his eyes pretty wide.\u201d This utterance shocked me as indicating a misconception of the way in which artistic impressions are formed in our minds, and because it seemed to imply that our eye is in that case simply a recording machine which takes instantaneous photographs\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0M. de Guermantes, rejoicing that she should be speaking to me with so competent a knowledge of the subjects that interested me, gazed at the illustrious bearing of his wife, listened to what she was saying about Franz Hals, and thought: \u201cShe rides rough-shod over everything! Our young friend can go home and say that he\u2019s had before his eyes a great lady of the old school, in the full sense of the word, the like of whom couldn\u2019t be found anywhere to-day.\u201d Thus I beheld the pair of them, withdrawn from that name Guermantes in which long ago I had imagined them leading an unimaginable life, now just like other men and other women, lingering, only, behind their contemporaries a little way, and that not evenly, as in so many households of the Faubourg, where the wife has had the good taste to stop at the golden, the husband the misfortune to come down to the pinchbeck age of history, she remaining still Louis XV while her partner is pompously Louis-Philippe. That Mme. de Guermantes should be like other women had been for me at first a disappointment; it was now, by a natural reaction and with all these good wines to help, almost a miracle. A Don John of Austria, an Isabella d\u2019Est\u00e9, situated for us in the world of names, have as little communication with the great pages of history as the M\u00e9s\u00e9glise way had with the Guermantes. Isabella d\u2019Est\u00e9 was no doubt in reality a very minor Princess, similar to those who under Louis XIV obtained no special place at Court. But seeming to us to be of a unique and therefore incomparable essence, we cannot conceive of her as being any less in greatness, so that a supper-party with Louis XIV would appear to us only to be rather interesting, whereas with Isabella d\u2019Este we should find ourselves, were we to meet her, gazing with our own eyes on a supernatural heroine of romance. Well, after we have, in studying Isabella d\u2019Est\u00e9, in transplanting her patiently from this world of fairyland into that of history, established the fact that her life, her thought contained nothing of that mysterious strangeness which had been suggested to us by her name, once this disappointment is complete we feel a boundless gratitude to this Princess for having had, of Mantegna\u2019s paintings, a knowledge almost equal to that, hitherto despised by us and put, as Fran\u00e7oise would have said, lower than the dirt, of M. Lafenestre. After having scaled the inaccessible heights of the name Guermantes, on descending the inner slope of the life of the Duchess, I felt on finding there the names, familiar elsewhere, of Victor Hugo, Franz Hals and, I regret to say, Vibert, the same astonishment that an explorer, after having taken into account, to imagine the singularity of the native customs in some wild valley of Central America or Northern Africa, its geographical remoteness, the strangeness of its flora, feels on discovering, once he has made his way through a hedge of giant aloes or manchineels, inhabitants who (sometimes indeed among the ruins of a Roman theatre and beneath a column dedicated to Venus) are engaged in reading M\u00e9rope or Alzire. And similarly, so remote, so distinct from, so far superior to the educated women of the middle classes whom I had known, the similar culture by which Mme. de Guermantes had made herself, with no ulterior motive, to gratify no ambition, descend to the level of people whom she would never know, had the character \u2014 meritorious, almost touching by virtue of being wholly useless \u2014 of an erudition in Phoenician antiquities in a politician or a doctor. \u201cI might have shewn you a very fine one,\u201d said Mme. de Guermantes, still speaking of Hals, \u201cthe finest in existence, some people say, which was left to me by a German cousin. Unfortunately, it turned out to be \u2018enfeoffed\u2019 in the castle \u2014 you don\u2019t know the expression, nor I either,\u201d she added, with her fondness for making jokes (which made her, she thought, seem modern) at the expense of the old customs to which nevertheless she was unconsciously but keenly attached. \u201cI am glad you have seen my Elstirs, but, I must admit, I should have been a great deal more glad if I could have done you the honours of my Hals, this \u2018enfeoffed\u2019 picture.\u201d \u201cI know the one,\u201d said Prince Von, \u201cit\u2019s the Grand Duke of Hesse\u2019s Hals.\u201d \u201cQuite so; his brother married my sister,\u201d said M. de Guermantes, \u201cand his mother and Oriane\u2019s were first cousins as well.\u201d \u201cBut so far as M. Elstir is concerned,\u201d the Prince went on, \u201cI shall take the liberty of saying, without having any opinion of his work, which I do not know, that the hatred with which the Emperor pursues him ought not, it seems to me, to be counted against him. The Emperor is a man of marvellous intelligence.\u201d \u201cYes, I\u2019ve met him at dinner twice, once at my aunt Sagan\u2019s and once at my aunt Radziwill\u2019s, and I must say I found him quite unusual. I didn\u2019t find him at all simple! But there is something amusing about him, something \u2018forced,\u2019\u201d she detached the word, \u201clike a green carnation, that is to say a thing that surprises me and docs not please me enormously, a thing it is surprising that anyone should have been able to create but which I feel would have been just as well uncreated. I trust I\u2019m not shocking you.\u201d \u201cThe Emperor is a man of astounding intelligence,\u201d resumed the Prince, \u201che is passionately fond of the arts he has for works of art a taste that is practically infallible, if a thing is good he spots it at once and takes a dislike to it. If he detests anything there can be no more doubt about it, the thing is excellent.\u201cEveryone smiled. \u201cYou set my mind at rest,\u201d said the Duchess. \u201cI should be inclined to compare the Emperor,\u201d went on the Prince, who, not knowing how to pronounce the word archaeologist (that is to say, as though it were spelt \u2018arkeologist\u2019), never missed an opportunity of using it, \u201cto an old archaeologist\u201d (but the Prince said \u2018arsheologist\u2019) \u201cwe have in Berlin. If you put him in front of a genuine Assyrian antique, he weeps. But if it is a modern sham, if it is not really old, he does not weep. And so, when they want to know whether an arsheological piece is really old, they take it to the old arsheologist. If he weeps, they buy the piece for the Museum. If his eyes remain dry, they send it back to the dealer, and prosecute him for fraud. Well, every time I dine at Potsdam, if the Emperor says to me, of a play: \u2018Prince, you must see that, it\u2019s a work of genius,\u2019 I make a note not to go to it; and when I hear him fulminating against an exhibition, I rush to see it at the first possible opportunity.\u201d \u201cNorpois is in favour of an Anglo-French understanding, isn\u2019t he?\u201d said M. de Guermantes. \u201cWhat use would that be to you?\u201d asked Prince Von, who could not endure the English, in a tone at once of irritation and cunning. \u201cThe English are so schtubid. I know, of course, that it would not be as soldiers that they would help you. But one can judge them, all the same, by the stupidity of their Generals. A friend of mine was talking the other day to Botha, you know, the Boer leader. He said to my friend: \u2018It\u2019s terrible, an army like that. I rather like the English, as a matter of fact, but just imagine that I, who am only a peasant, have beaten them in every battle. And in the last, when I gave way before a force twenty times the strength of my own, while I myself surrendered, because I had to, I managed to take two thousand prisoners! That was good enough, because I was only commanding an army of farmers, but if those poor fools ever have to stand up against a European army, one trembles to think what may happen to them!\u2019 Besides, you have only to see how their King, whom you know as well as I do, passes for a great man in England.\u201d I barely listened to these stories, stories of the kind that M. de Norpois used to tell my father; they supplied no food for my favourite train of thought; and besides, even had they possessed the elements which they lacked, they would have had to be of a very exciting quality for my inner life to awaken during those hours in which I dwelt in my skin, my well-brushed hair, my starched shirt-front, in which, that is to say, I could feel nothing of what constituted for me the pleasure of life. \u201cOh, I don\u2019t agree with you at all,\u201d said Mme. de Guermantes, who felt that the German Prince was wanting in tact, \u201cI find King Edward charming, so simple, and much cleverer than people think. And the Queen is, even now, the most beautiful thing I\u2019ve ever seen in the world.\u201d \u201cBut, Madame la Duchesse,\u201d said the Prince, who was losing his temper and did not see that he was giving offence, \u201cyou must admit that if the Prince of Wales had been an ordinary person there isn\u2019t a club that wouldn\u2019t have blackballed him, and nobody would have been willing to shake hands with him. The Queen is charming, exceedingly sweet and limited. But after all there is something shocking about a royal couple who are literally kept by their subjects, who get the big Jewish financiers to foot all the bills they ought to pay themselves, and create them Baronets in return. It\u2019s like the Prince of Bulgaria . . . \u201d \u201cHe\u2019s our cousin,\u201d put in the Duchess. \u201cHe\u2019s a clever fellow.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s mine, too, but we don\u2019t think him a good fellow on that account. No, it is us you ought to make friends with, it\u2019s the Emperor\u2019s dearest wish, but he insists on its coming from the heart. He says: \u2018What I want to see is a hand clasped in mine, not waving a hat in the air.\u2019 With that, you would be invincible. It would be more practical than the Anglo-French friendship M. de Norpois preaches.\u201d \u201cYou know him, of course,\u201d the Duchess said, turning to me, so as not to leave me out of the conversation. Remembering that M. de Norpois had said that I had once looked as though I wanted to kiss his hand, thinking that he had no doubt repeated this story to Mme. de Guermantes, and in any event could have spoken of me to her only with malice, since in spite of his friendship with my father he had not hesitated to make me appear so ridiculous, I did not do what a man of the world would have done. He would have said that he detested M. de Norpois, and had let him see it; he would have said this so as to give himself the appearance of being the deliberate cause of the Ambassador\u2019s slanders, which would then have been no more than lying and calculated reprisals. I said, on the other hand, that, to my great regret, I was afraid that M. de Norpois did not like me. \u201cYou are quite mistaken,\u201d replied the Duchess, \u201che likes you very much indeed. You can ask Basin, for if people give me the reputation of only saying nice things, he certainly doesn\u2019t. He will tell you that we have never heard Norpois speak about anyone so kindly as he spoke to us of you. And only the other day he was wanting to give you a fine post at the Ministry. As he knew that you were not very strong and couldn\u2019t accept it, he had the delicacy not to speak of his kind thought to your father, for whom he has an unbounded admiration.\u201d M. de Norpois was quite the last person whom I should have expected to do me any practical service. The truth was that, his being a mocking and indeed somewhat malicious spirit, those people who had let themselves be taken in as I had by his outward appearance of a Saint Louis delivering justice beneath an oak-tree, by the sounds, easily modulated to pity, that emerged from his somewhat too tuneful lips, believed in a deliberate betrayal when they learned of a slander uttered at their expense by a man who had always seemed to put his whole heart into his speech. These slanders were frequent enough with him. But that did not prevent him from feeling attractions, from praising the people he liked and taking pleasure in shewing that he could be of use to them. \u201cNot that I\u2019m in the least surprised at his appreciating you,\u201d said Mme. de Guermantes, \u201che\u2019s an intelligent man. And I can quite understand,\u201d she added, for the benefit of the rest of the party, making allusion to a purpose of marriage of which I had heard nothing, \u201cthat my aunt, who has long ceased to amuse him as an old mistress, may not seem of very much use to him as a young wife. Especially as I understand that even as a mistress she has ceased for years now to serve any practical purpose, she is more wrapped up in her devotions than anv thing else. Boaz-Norpois can say, in the words of Victor Hugo:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Voil\u00e0 longtemps que celle avec qui j\u2019ai dormi\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0O Seigneur, a quitt\u00e9 ma couche pour la v\u00f4tre!\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Really, my poor aunt is like the artists of the advanced guard who have stood out all their lives against the Academy, and in the end start a little academy of their own, or the unfrocked priests who get up a little private religion. They should either keep their frocks, or not stick to their profession. And who knows,\u201d went on the Duchess with a meditative air, \u201cit may be in preparation for her widowhood, there\u2019s nothing sadder than the weeds one\u2019s not entitled to wear.\u201d \u201cAh! If Mme. de Villeparisis were to become Mme. de Norpois, I really believe our cousin Gilbert would take to his bed,\u201d said General de Monserfeuil. \u201cThe Prince de Guermantes is a charming man, but he is, really, very much taken up with questions of birth and manners,\u201d said the Princesse de Parme. \u201cI went down to spend a few days with them in the country, when the Princess, unfortunately, was ill in bed. I was accompanied by Petite.\u201d (This was a nickname that was given to Mme. d\u2019Hunolstein because she was enormously stout.) \u201cThe Prince came to meet me at the foot of the steps, and pretended not to see Petite. We went up to the first floor, to the door into the reception rooms, and then, stepping back to make way for me, he said: \u2018Oh, how d\u2019ye do, Mme. d\u2019Hunolstein?\u2019 (he always calls her that now, since her separation) pretending to have caught sight of Petite for the first time, so as to shew her that he had not come down to receive her at the foot of the steps.\u201d \u201cThat doesn\u2019t surprise me in the least. I don\u2019t need to tell you,\u201d said the Duke, who regarded himself as extremely modern, more contemptuous than anyone in the world of mere birth, and in fact a Republican, \u201cthat I have not many ideas in common with my cousin. Ma\u2019am can imagine that we are just about as much agreed on most subjects as day and night. But I must say that if my aunt were to marry Norpois, for once I should be of Gilbert\u2019s opinion. To be the daughter of Florimond de Guise, and then to make a marriage like that would be enough, as the saying is, to make a cat laugh; what more can I say?\u201d These last words, which the Duke uttered as a rule in the middle of a sentence, were here quite superfluous. But he felt a perpetual need to be saying them which made him postpone them to the end of a speech if he had found no place for them elsewhere. They were for him, among other things, almost a question of prosody. \u201cRemember, though,\u201d he added, \u201cthat the Norpois are gallant gentlemen with a good place, of a good stock.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cListen to me, Basin, it\u2019s really not worth your while to poke fun at Gilbert if you\u2019re going to speak the same language as he does,\u201d said Mme. de Guermantes, for whom the \u2018goodness\u2019 of a family, no less than that of a wine, consisted in its age. But, less frank than her cousin and more subtle than her husband, she made a point of never in her conversation playing false to the Guermantes spirit, and despised rank in her speech while ready to honour it by her actions. \u201cBut aren\u2019t you some sort of cousins?\u201d asked General de Monserfeuil. \u201cI seem to remember that Norpois married a La Rochefoucauld.\u201d \u201cNot in that way at all, she belonged to the branch of the Ducs de La Rochefoucauld, my grandmother came from the Ducs de Doudeauville. She was own grandmother to Edouard Coco, the wisest man in the family,\u201d replied the Duke, whose views of wisdom were somewhat superficial, \u201cand the two branches haven\u2019t intermarried since Louis XIV\u2019s time; the connexion would be rather distant.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI say, that\u2019s interesting; I never knew that,\u201d said the General. \u201cHowever,\u201d went on M. de Guermantes, \u201chis mother, I believe, was the sister of the Duc de Montmorency, and had originally been married to a La Tour d\u2019Auvergne. But as those Montmorencys are barely Montmorencys, while those La Tour d\u2019Auvergnes are not La Tour d\u2019Auvergnes at all, I cannot see that it gives him any very great position. He says \u2014 and this should be more to the point \u2014 that he\u2019s descended from Saintrailles, and as we ourselves are in a direct line of descent. . . . \u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There was at Combray a Rue de Saintrailles, to which I had never given another thought. It led from the Rue de la Bretonnerie to the Rue de l\u2019Oiseau. And as Saintrailles, the companion of Joan of Arc, had, by marrying a Guermantes, brought into that family the County of Combray, his arms were quartered with those of Guermantes at the foot of one of the windows in Saint-Hilaire. I saw again a vision of dark sandstone steps, while a modulation of sound brought to my ears that name, Guermantes, in the forgotten tone in which I used to hear it long ago, so different from that in which it was used to signify the genial hosts with whom I was dining this evening. If the name, Duchesse de Guermantes, was for me a collective name, it was so not merely in history, by the accumulation of all the women who had successively borne it, but also in the course of my own short life, which had already seen, in this single Duchesse de Guermantes, so many different women superimpose themselves, each one vanishing as soon as the next had acquired sufficient consistency. Words do not change their meaning as much in centuries as names do for us in the space of a few years. Our memory and our heart are not large enough to be able to remain faithful. We have not room enough, in our mental field, to keep the dead there as well as the living. We are obliged to build over what has gone before and is brought to light only by a chance excavation, such as the name Saintrailles had just wrought in my mind. I felt that it would be useless to explain all this, and indeed a little while earlier I had lied by implication in not answering when M. de Guermantes said to me: \u201cYou don\u2019t know our old wheedler?\u201d Perhaps he was quite well aware that I did know him, and it was only from good breeding that he did not press the question\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. de Guermantes drew me out of my meditation. \u201cReally, I find all that sort of thing too deadly. Listen, it\u2019s not always as boring as this at my parties. I hope that you will soon come and dine again as a compensation, with no pedigrees next time,\u201d she murmured, incapable both of appreciating the kind of charm which I could find in her house and of having sufficient humility to be content to appeal to me only as a herbarium, filled with plants of another day\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What Mme. de Guermantes believed to be disappointing my expectations was on the contrary what in the end \u2014 for the Duke and the General went on to discuss pedigrees now without stopping \u2014 saved my evening from becoming a complete disappointment. How could I have felt otherwise until now? Each of my fellow-guests at dinner, smothering the mysterious name under which I had only at a distance known and dreamed of them with a body and with a mind similar or inferior to those of all the people I knew, had given me the impression of flat vulgarity which the view on entering the Danish port of Elsinore would give to any passionate admirer of Hamlet. No doubt those geographical regions and that ancient past which put forest glades and gothic belfries into their names had in a certain measure formed their faces, their intellects and their prejudices, but survived in them only as does the cause in the effect, that is to say as a thing possible for the brain to extract but in no way perceptible to the imagination\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And these old-time prejudices restored in a flash to the friends of M. and Mme. de Guermantes their vanished poetry. Assuredly, the motions in the possession of nobles, which make of them the scholars, the etymologists of the language not of words but of names (and this, moreover, relatively only to the ignorant mass of the middle classes, for if at the same level of mediocrity a devout Catholic would be better able to stand questioning upon the details of the Liturgy than a free-thinker, on the other hand an anti-clerical archaeologist can often give points to his parish priest on everything connected even with the latter\u2019s own church), those notions, if we are going to confine ourselves to the truth, that is to say to the spirit, had not for these great gentlemen the charm that they would have had for a man of simple birth. They knew perhaps better than myself that the Duchesse de Guise was Princess of Cleves, of Orleans and of Porcien, and all the rest, but they had known, long before they knew all these names, the face of the Duchesse de Guise which thenceforward the names reflected back to them. I had begun with the fairy \u2014 were she fated shortly to perish \u2014 they with the woman\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In middle-class families one sometimes sees jealousies spring up if the younger sister is married before the elder. So the aristocratic world, Courvoisiers especially but Guermantes also, reduced its ennobled greatness to simple domestic superiorities, by a system of child\u2019s-play which I had me\u2019 originally (and this gave it for me its sole charm) in books. Is it not just as though Tallemant des R\u00e9aux were speaking of the Guermantes, and not of the Rohans, when he relates with evident satisfaction how M. de Gu\u00e9m\u00e9n\u00e9e cried to his brother: \u201cYou can come in here; this is not the Louvre!\u201d and said of the Chevalier de Rohan (because he was a natural son of the Duc de Clermont): \u201cAt any rate, he\u2019s a Prince.\u201d The only thing that distressed me in all this talk was to find that the absurd stories which were being circulated about the charming Hereditary Grand Duke of Luxembourg found as much credence in this drawing-room as they had among Saint-Loup\u2019s friends. Plainly it was an epidemic that would not last longer than perhaps a year or two but had meanwhile infected everyone. People repeated the same old stories, or enriched them with others equally untrue. I gathered that the Princesse de Luxembourg herself, while apparently defending her nephew, supplied weapons for the assault. \u201cYou are wrong to stand up for him,\u201d M. de Guermantes told me, as Saint-Loup had told me before. \u201cWhy, without taking into consideration the opinion of our family, who are unanimous about him, you have only to talk to his servants, and they, after all, are the people who know him best. M. de Luxembourg gave his little Negro page to his nephew. The Negro came back in tears: \u2018Grand Duke beaten me; me no bad boy; Grand Duke naughty man,\u2019 it\u2019s really too much. And I can speak with some knowledge, he\u2019s Oriane\u2019s cousin.\u201d I cannot, by the way, say how many times in the course of this evening I heard the word \u2018cousin\u2019 used. On the one hand, M. de Guermantes, almost at every name that was mentioned, exclaimed: \u201cBut he\u2019s Oriane\u2019s cousin!\u201d with the sudden joy of a man who, lost in a forest, reads at the ends of a pair of arrows pointing in opposite directions on a metal plate, and followed by quite a low number of kilometres, the words: \u201cBelv\u00e9d\u00e8re Casimir-Perier\u201d and \u201cCroix du Grand-Veneur,\u201d and gathers from them that he is on the right road. On the other hand the word cousin was employed in a wholly different connexion (which was here the exception to the prevailing rule) by the Turkish Ambassadress, who had come in after dinner. Devoured by social ambition and endowed with a real power of assimilating knowledge, she would pick up with equal facility the story of the Retreat of the Ten Thousand or the details of sexual perversion among birds. It would have been impossible to \u2018stump\u2019 her on any of the most recent German publications, whether they dealt with political economy, mental aberrations, the various forms of onanism, or the philosophy of Epicurus. She was, incidentally, a dangerous person to listen to, for, perpetually in error, she would point out to you as being of the loosest morals women of irreproachable virtue, would put you on your guard against a gentleman whose intentions were perfectly honourable, and would tell you anecdotes of the sort that seem always to have come out of a book, not so much because they are serious as because they are so wildly improbable\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She was at this period little received in society. She had been going for some weeks now to the houses of women of real social brilliance, such as the Duchesse de Guermantes, but as a general rule had confined herself, of necessity, in the noblest families, to obscure scions whom the Guermantes had ceased to know. She hoped to give herself a really fashionable air by quoting the most historic names of the little-known people who were her friends. At once M. de Guermantes, thinking that she was referring to people who frequently dined at his table, quivered with joy at finding himself once more in sight of a landmark and shouted the rallying-cry: \u201cBut he\u2019s Oriane\u2019s cousin! I know him as well as I know my own name. He lives in the Rue Vaneau. His mother was Mlle. d\u2019Uz\u00e9s.\u201d The Ambassadress was obliged to admit that her specimen had been drawn from smaller game. She tried to connect her friends with those of M. de Guermantes by cutting across his track: \u201cI know quite well who\u2019 you mean. No, it\u2019s not those ones, they\u2019re cousins.\u201d But this cross-current launched by the unfortunate Ambassadress ran but a little way. For M. de Guermantes, losing interest, answered: \u201cOh, then I don\u2019t know who\u2019 you\u2019re talking about.\u201d The Ambassadress offered no reply, for if she never knew anyone nearer than the \u2018cousins\u2019 of those whom she ought to have known in person, very often these \u2018cousins\u2019 were not even related at all. Then from the lips of M. de Guermantes, would flow a fresh wave of \u201cBut she\u2019s Oriane\u2019s cousin!\u201d words which seemed to have for the Duke the same practical value as certain epithets, convenient to the Roman poets because they provided them with dactyls or spondees for their hexameters. At least the explosion of: \u201cBut she\u2019s Oriane\u2019s cousin!\u201d appeared to me quite natural when applied to the Princesse de Guermantes, who was indeed very closely related to the Duchess. The Ambassadress did not seem to care for this Princess. She said to me in an undertone: \u201cShe is stupid. No, she is not so beautiful as all that. That claim is usurped. Anyhow,\u201d she went on, with an air at once reflective, rejecting and decided, \u201cI find her most uncongenial.\u201d But often the cousinship extended a great deal further than this, Mme. de Guermantes making it a point of honour to address as \u2018Aunt\u2019 ladies with whom it would have been impossible to find her an ancestress in common without going back at least to Louis XV; just as, whenever the \u2018hardness\u2019 of the times brought it about that a multimillionairess married a prince whose great-great-grandfather had espoused, as had Oriane\u2019s also, a daughter of Louvois, one of the chief joys of the fair American was to be able, after a first visit to the H\u00f4tel de Guermantes, where she was, incidentally, more or less coldly received and hotly cross-examined, to say \u2018Aunt\u2019 to Mme. de Guermantes, who allowed her to do so with a maternal smile. But little did it concern me what birth meant for M. de Guermantes and M. de Monserfeuil; in the conversations which they held on the subject I sought only for a poetic pleasure. Without being conscious of it themselves, they procured me this pleasure as might a couple of labourers or sailors speaking of the soil or the tides, realities too little detached from their own lives for them to be capable of enjoying the beauty which personally I proceeded to extract from them\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes rather than of a race it was of a particular fact, of a date that a name reminded me. Hearing M. de Guermantes recall that M. de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9\u2018s mother had been a Choiseul and his grandmother a Lucinge, I fancied I could see beneath the commonplace shirt with its plain pearl studs, bleeding still in two globes of crystal, those august relics, the hearts of Mme. de Praslin and of the Duc de Berri. Others were more voluptuous: the fine and flowing hair of Mme. de Tallien or Mme. de Sabran\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Better informed than his wife as to what their ancestors had been, M. de Guermantes found himself the possessor of memories which gave to his conversation a fine air of an ancient mansion stripped of its real treasures but still full of pictures, authentic, indifferent and majestic, which taken as a whole look remarkably well. The Prince d\u2019Agrigente having asked why Prince Von had said, in speaking of the Due d\u2019Aumale, \u2018my uncle,\u2019 M. de Guermantes had replied: \u201cBecause his mother\u2019s brother, the Duke of Wurttemberg, married a daughter of Louis-Philippe.\u201d At once I was lost in contemplation of a casket, such as Carpaccio or Memling used to paint, from its first panel in which the Princess, at the wedding festivities of her brother the Duc d\u2019Orl\u00e9ans, appeared wearing a plain garden dress to indicate her resentment at having seen the return, empty-handed, of the ambassadors who had been sent to sue on her behalf for the hand of the Prince of Syracuse, down to the last, in which she had just given birth to a son, the Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg (the first cousin of the Prince whom I had met at dinner), in that castle called Fantaisie, one of those places which are as aristocratic as certain families. They, moreover, outlasting a single generation of men, see attached to themselves more than one historical personage. In this one, especially, survive side by side memories of the Margravine of Bayreuth, of this other somewhat fantastic Princess (the Duc d\u2019Orl\u00e9ans\u2019s sister), to whom it was said that the name of her husband\u2019s castle made a distinct appeal, of the King of Bavaria, and finally of Prince Von, to whom it was simply his own postal address, at which he had just asked the Duc de Guermantes to write to him, for he had succeeded to it, and let it only during the Wagner festivals, to the Prince de Polignac, another delightful \u2018fantasist.\u2019 When M. de Guermantes, to explain how he was related to Mme. d\u2019Arpajon, was obliged, going so far and so simply, to climb the chain formed by the joined hands of three or five ancestresses back to Marie-Louise or Colbert, it was still the same thing in each case; a great historical event appeared only in passing, masked, unnatural, reduced, in the name of a property, in the Christian names of a woman, so selected because she was the granddaughter of Louis-Philippe and Marie-Am\u00e9lie, considered no longer as King and Queen of the French, but merely in the extent to which in their capacity as grandparents they bequeathed a heritage. (We see for other reasons in a gazetteer of the works of Balzac, where the most illustrious personages figure only according to their connexion with the Com\u00e9die Humaine, Napoleon occupy a space considerably less than that allotted to Rastignac, and occupy that space solely because he once spoke to the young ladies of Cinq-Cygne.) Similarly the aristocracy, in its heavy structure, pierced with rare windows, admitting a scanty daylight, shewing the same incapacity to soar but also the same massive and blind force as the architecture of the romanesque age, embodies all our history, immures it, beetles over it\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus the empty spaces of my memory were covered by degrees with names which in taking order, in composing themselves with relation to one another, in linking themselves to one another by an increasingly numerous connexion, resembled those finished works of art in which there is not one touch that is isolated, in which every part in turn receives from the rest a justification which it confers on them\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0M. de Luxembourg\u2019s name having come up again in the course of the conversation, the Turkish Ambassadress told us how, the young bride\u2019s grandfather (he who had made that immense fortune out of flour and cereals) having invited M. de Luxembourg to luncheon, the latter had written to decline, putting on the envelope: \u201cM. So-and-So, Miller,\u201d to which the grandfather had replied: \u201cI am all the more disappointed that you were not able to come, my dear friend, because I should have been able to enjoy your society quite intimately, for we were quite an intimate party, just ourselves, and there would have been only the Miller, his Son, and you.\u201d This story was not merely utterly distasteful to me, who knew the impossibility of my dear M. de Nassau\u2019s writing to the grandfather of his wife (whose fortune, moreover, he was expecting to inherit) and addressing him as \u2018Miller\u2019; but furthermore its stupidity became glaring from the start, the word \u2018Miller\u2019 having obviously been dragged in only to lead up to the title of La Fontaine\u2019s fable. But there is in the Faubourg Saint-Germain a silliness so great, when it is aggravated by malice, that they decided that the letter had been sent and that the grandfather, as to whom at once everyone confidently declared that he was a remarkable man, had shewn a prettier wit than his grandson-in-law. The Duc de Ch\u00e2tellerault tried to take advantage of this story to tell the one that I had heard in the caf\u00e9: \u201cEveryone had to lie down!\u201d\u2014 but scarcely had he begun, or reported M. de Luxembourg\u2019s pretension that in his wife\u2019s presence M. de Guermantes ought to stand up, when the Duchess stopped him with the protest: \u201cNo, he is very absurd, but not as bad as that.\u201d I was privately convinced that all these stories at the expense of M. de Luxembourg were equally untrue, and that whenever I found myself face to face with any of th reputed actors or spectators I should hear the same contradiction. I asked myself, nevertheless, whether the contradiction just uttered by Mme. de Guermantes had been inspired by regard for truth or by self-esteem. In either event the latter quality succumbed to malice, for she went on, with a laugh: \u201cNot that I haven\u2019t had my little fling at him too, for he invited me to luncheon, wishing to make me know the Grand Duchess of Luxembourg, which is how he has the good taste to describe his wife when he\u2019s writing to his aunt. I sent a reply expressing my regret, and adding: As for the \u2018Grand Duchess of Luxembourg\u2019 (in inverted commas), tell her that if she is coming to see me I am at home every Thursday after five. I have even had another little fling. Happening to be at Luxembourg, I telephoned, asking him to ring me up. His Highness was going to luncheon, had just risen from luncheon, two hours went by and nothing happened; so then I employed another method: \u2018Will you tell the Comte de Nassau to come and speak to me?\u2019 Cut to the quick, he was at the instrument that very minute.\u201d Everyone laughed at the Duchess\u2019s story, and at other analogous, that is to say (I am convinced of it) equally untrue stories, for a man more intelligent, better, more refined, in a word more exquisite than this Luxembourg-Nassau I have never met. The sequel will shew that it was I who was in the right. I must admit that, in the midst of her onslaught, Mme. de Guermantes had still a kind word for him. \u201cHe was not always like that,\u201d she informed us. \u201cBefore he went off his head, like the man in the story-book who thinks he\u2019s become king, he was no fool, and indeed in the early days of his engagement he used to speak of it in really quite a nice way, as something he could never have dreamed of: \u2018It\u2019s just like a fairy-tale; I shall have to make my entry into Luxembourg in a fairy coach,\u2019 he said to his uncle d\u2019Ornessan, who answered \u2014 for you know it\u2019s not a very big place, Luxembourg: \u2018A fairy coach! I\u2019m afraid, my dear fellow, you\u2019d never get it in. I should suggest that you take a goat carriage.\u2019 Not only did this not annoy Nassau, but he was the first to tell us the story, and to laugh at it.\u201d \u201cOrnessan is a witty fellow, and he\u2019s every rea \u2014 son to be; his mother was a Montjeu. lie\u2019s in a very bad way now, poor Ornessan.\u201d This name had the magic virtue of interrupting the flow of stale witticisms which otherwise would have gone on for ever. In fact, M. de Guermantes had to explain that M. d\u2019Ornessan\u2019s great-grandmother had been the sister of Marie de Castille Montjeu, the wife of Timol\u00e9on de Lorraine, and consequently Oriane\u2019s aunt, with the result that the conversation drifted back to genealogies, while the idiot of a Turkish Ambassadress breathed in my ear: \u201cYou appear to be very much in the Duke\u2019s good books; have a care!\u201d and, on my demanding an explanation: \u201cI mean to say, you understand what I mean, he\u2019s a man to whom one could safely entrust one\u2019s daughter, but not one\u2019s son.\u201d Now if ever, on the contrary, a man existed who was passionately and exclusively a lover of women, it was certainly the Duc de Guermantes. The state of error, the falsehood fatuously believed to be the truth, were for the Ambassadress like a vital element out of which she could not move. \u201cHis brother M\u00e9m\u00e9, who is, as it happens, for other reasons altogether\u201d (he did not bow to her) \u201cprofoundly uncongenial to me, is genuinely distressed by the Duke\u2019s morals. So is their aunt Villeparisis. Ah, now, her I adore! There is a saint of a woman for you, the true type of the great ladies of the past. It\u2019s not only her actual virtue that\u2019s so wonderful but her restraint. She still says \u2018Monsieur\u2019 to the Ambassador Norpois whom she sees every day, and who, by the way, left an excellent impression behind him in Turkey.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I did not even reply to the Ambassadress, in order to listen to the genealogies. They were not all of them important. There came up indeed in the course of the conversation one of those unexpected alliances, which, M. de Guermantes informed me, was a misalliance, but not without charm, for, uniting under the July Monarchy the Duc de Guermantes and the Duc de Fezensac with the two irresistible daughters of an eminent navigator, it gave the two Duchesses the exciting novelty of a grace exotically middle-class, \u2018Louisphilippically\u2019 Indian. Or else, under Louis XIV, a Norpois had married the daughter of the Duc de Mortenart, whose illustrious title struck, in the remoteness of that epoch, the name \u2014 which I had found colourless and might have supposed to be modern \u2014 of Norpois, carving deeply upon it the beauty of an old medal. And in these cases, moreover, it was not only the less well-known name that benefited by the association; the other, grown commonplace by the fact of its lustre, struck me more forcibly in this novel and more obscure aspect, just as among the portraits painted by a brilliant colourist the most striking is sometimes one that is all in black. The sudden mobility with which all these names seemed to me to have been endowed, as they sprang to take their places by the side of others from which I should have supposed them to be remote, was due not to my ignorance alone; the country-dances which they were performing in my mind they had carried out no less spontaneously at those epochs in which a title, being always attached to a piece of land, used to follow it from one family to another, so much so that, for example, in the fine feudal structure that is the title of Duc de Nemours or Duc de Chevreuse, I was able to discover successively hidden, as in the hospitable abode of a hermit-crab, a Guise, a Prince of Savoy, an Orl\u00e9ans, a Luynes. Sometimes several remained in competition for a single shell: for the Principality of Orange the Royal House of the Netherlands and MM. de Mailly-Nesle for the Duchy of Brabant the Baron de Charlus and the Royal House of Belgium, various others for the titles of Prince of Naples, Duke of Parma Duke of Reggio. Sometimes it was the other way; the shell had been so\u2019 long uninhabited by proprietors long since dead that it had never occurred to me that this or that name of a country house could have been, at an epoch which after all was comparatively recent, the name of a family. And so, when M. de Guermantes replied to a question put to him by M. de Monserfeuil: \u201cNo, my cousin was a fanatical Royalist; she was the daughter of the Marquis de F\u00e9terne, who played a certain part in the Chouan rising,\u201d on seeing this name F\u00e9terne, which had been for me, since my stay at Balbec, the name of a country house, become, what I had never dreamed that it could possibly be, a family name, I felt the same astonishment as in reading a fairy-tale, where turrets and a terrace come to life and turn into men and women. In this sense of the words, we may say that history, even mere family history, gives life to the old stones of a house. There have been in Parisian society men who played as considerable a part in it, who were more sought after for their distinction or for their wit, who were equally well born as the Duc de Guermantes or the Duc de La Tr\u00e9mo\u00eflle. They have now fallen into oblivion because, as they left no descendants, their name which we no longer hear sounds like a name unknown; at most, the name of a thing beneath which we never think to discover the name of any person, it survives in some country house, some remote village. The day is not distant when the traveller who, in the heart of Burgundy, stops in the little village of Charlus to look at its church, if he has not sufficient industry or is in too great a hurry to examine its tombstones, will go away ignorant that this name, Charlus, was that of a man who ranked with the highest in the land. This thought reminded me that it was time to go, and that while I was listening to M. de Guermantes talking pedigrees, the hour was approaching at which I had promised to call upon his brother. \u201cWho knows,\u201d I continued to muse, \u201cwhether one day Guermantes itself may not appear nothing more than a place-name, save to the archaeologists who, stopping by chance at Combray and standing beneath the window of Gilbert the Bad, have the patience to listen to the account given them by Theodore\u2019s successor or to read the Cure\u2019s guide?\u201d But so long as a great name is not extinct it keeps in the full light of day those men and women who bear it; and there can be no doubt that, to a certain extent, the interest which the illustriousness of these families gave them in my eyes lay in the fact that one can, starting from to-day, follow their ascending course, step by step, to a point far beyond the fourteenth century, recover the diaries and correspondence of all the forebears of M. de Charlus, of the Prince d\u2019Agrigente, of the Princesse de Parme, in a past in which an impenetrable night would cloak the origins of a middle-class family, and in which we make out, in the luminous backward projection of a name, the origin and persistence of certain nervous characteristics, certain vices, the disorders of one or another Guermantes. Almost identical pathologically with their namesakes of the present day, they excite from century to century the startled interest of their correspondents, whether these be anterior to the Princess Palatine and Mme. de Motteville, or subsequent to the Prince de Ligne\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, my historical curiosity was faint in comparison with my aesthetic pleasure. The names cited had the effect of disincarnating the Duchess\u2019s guests, whom, for all they might call themselves Prince d\u2019Agrigente or de Cystira, their mask of flesh and of a common intelligence or want of intelligence had transformed into ordinary mortals, so much so that I had made my landing on the ducal door-mat not as upon the threshold (as I had supposed) but as at the farthest confines of the enchanted world of names. The Prince d\u2019Agrigente himself, as soon as I heard that his mother had been a Damas, a granddaughter of the Duke of Modena, was delivered, as from an unstable chemical alloy, from the face and speech that prevented one from recognising him, and went to form with Damas and Modena, which themselves were only titles, a combination infinitely more seductive. Each name displaced by the attractions of another, with which I had never suspected it of having any affinity, left the unalterable position which it had occupied in my brain, where familiarity had dulled it, and, speeding to join the Mortemarts, the Stuarts or the Bourbons, traced with them branches of the most graceful design and an ever-changing colour. The name Guermantes itself received from all the beautiful names \u2014 extinct, and so all the more glowingly rekindled \u2014 with which I learned only now that it was connected, a new sense and purpose, purely poetical. At the most, at the extremity of each spray that burgeoned from the exalted stem, I could see it flower in some face of a wise king or illustrious princess, like the sire of Henri IV or the Duchesse de Longueville. But as these faces, different in this respect from those of the party around me, were not discoloured for me by any trace of physical experience or fashionable mediocrity, they remained, in their handsome outlines and rainbow iridescence, homogeneous with those names which at regular intervals, each of a different hue, detached themselves from the genealogical tree of Guermantes, and disturbed with no foreign or opaque matter the buds \u2014 pellucid, alternate, many-coloured \u2014 which (like, in the old Jesse windows, the ancestors of Jesus) blossomed on either side of the tree of glass\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Already I had made several attempts to slip away, on account, more than for any other reason, of the triviality which my presence at it imparted to the gathering, albeit it was one of those which I had long imagined as being so beautiful \u2014 as it would doubtless have been had there been no inconvenient witness present. At least my departure would permit the other guests, once the profane intruder was no longer among them, to constitute themselves at length into a secret conclave. They would be free to celebrate the mysteries for the celebration of which they had met together, for it could obviously not have been to talk of Franz Hals or of avarice, and to talk of them in the same way as people talk in middle-class society. They uttered nothing but trivialities, doubtless because I was in the room, and I felt with some compunction, on seeing all these pretty women kept apart, that I was preventing them by my presence from carrying on, in the most precious of its drawing-rooms, the mysterious life of the Faubourg Saint-Germain. But this departure which I was trying at every moment to effect, M. and Mme. de Guermantes carried the spirit of self-sacrifice so far as to postpone, by keeping me in the room. A more curious thing still, several of the ladies who had come hurrying, delighted, beautifully dressed, with constellations of jewels, to be present at a party which, through my fault only, differed in no essential point from those that are given elsewhere than in the Faubourg Saint-Germain, any more than one feels oneself at Balbec to be in a town that differs from what one\u2019s eyes are accustomed to see \u2014 several of these ladies retired not at all disappointed, as they had every reason to be, but thanking Mme. de Guermantes most effusively for the delightful evening which they had spent, as though on the other days, those on which I was not present, nothing more used to occur\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Was it really for the sake of dinners such as this that all these people dressed themselves up and refused to allow the penetration of middle-class women into their so exclusive drawing-rooms \u2014 for dinners such as this? The same, had I been absent? The suspicion flashed across my mind for a moment, but it was too absurd. Plain commonsense enabled me to brush it aside. And then, if I had adopted it, what would have been left of the name Guermantes, already so degraded since Combray?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It struck me that these flower-maidens were, to a strange extent, either ready to be pleased with another person or anxious to make that person pleased with them, for more than one of them, to whom I had not uttered, during the whole course of the evening, more than two or three casual remarks, the stupidity of which had left me blushing, made a point, before leaving the drawing-room, of coming to tell me, fastening on me her fine caressing eyes, straightening as she spoke the garland of orchids that followed the curve of her bosom, what an intense pleasure it had been to her to make my acquaintance, and to speak to me \u2014 a veiled allusion to an invitation to dinner \u2014 of her desire to \u2018arrange something\u2019 after she had \u2018fixed a day\u2019 with Mme. de Guermantes. None of these flower ladies left the room before the Princesse de Parme. The presence of that lady \u2014 one must never depart before Royalty \u2014 was one of the two reasons, neither of which I had guessed, for which the Duchess had insisted so strongly on my remaining. As soon as Mme. de Parme had risen, it was like a deliverance. Each of the ladies having made a genuflexion before the Princess, who raised her up from the ground, they received from her, in a kiss, and like a benediction which they had craved kneeling, the permission to ask for their cloaks and carriages. With the result that there followed, at the front door, a sort of stentorian recital of great names from the History of France. The Princesse de Parme had forbidden Mme. de Guermantes to accompany her downstairs to the hall for fear of her catching cold, and the Duke had added: \u201cThere, Oriane, since Ma\u2019am gives you leave, remember what the doctor told you.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI am sure the Princesse de Parme was most pleased to take dinner with you.\u201d I knew the formula. The Duke had come the whole way across the drawing-room in order to utter it before me with an obliging, concerned air, as though he were handing me a diploma or offering me a plateful of biscuits. And I guessed from the pleasure which he appeared to be feeling as he spoke, and which brought so sweet an expression momentarily into his face, that the effort which this represented for him was of the kind which he would continue to make to the very end of his life, like one of those honorific and easy posts which, even when paralytic, one is still allowed to retain\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Just as I was about to leave, the lady in waiting reappeared in the drawing-room, having forgotten to take away some wonderful carnations, sent up from Guermantes, which the Duchess had presented to Mme. de Parme. The lady in waiting was somewhat flushed, one felt that she had just been receiving a scolding, for the Princess, so kind to everyone else, could not contain her impatience at the stupidity of her attendant. And so the latter picked up the flowers and ran quickly, but to preserve her air of ease and independence flung at me as she passed: \u201cThe Princess says I\u2019m keeping her waiting; she wants to be gone, and to have the carnations as well. Good lord! I\u2019m not a little bird, I can\u2019t be in two places at once.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Alas! the rule of not leaving before Royalty was not the only one. I could not depart at once, for there was another: this was that the famous lavishness, unknown to the Courvoisiers, with which the Guermantes, whether opulent or practically ruined, excelled in entertaining their friends, was not only a material lavishness, of the kind that I had often experienced with Robert de Saint-Loup, but also a lavish display of charming words, of courteous actions, a whole system of verbal elegance supplied from a positive treasure-house within. But as this last, in the inactivity of fashionable existence, must remain unemployed, it expanded at times, sought an outlet in a sort of fugitive effusion, all the more intense, which might, in Mme. de Guermantes, have led one to suppose a genuine affection for oneself. Which she did, for that matter, feel at the moment when she let it overflow, for she found then in the society of the friend, man or woman, with whom she happened to be a sort of intoxication, in no way sensual, similar to that which music produces in certain people; she would suddenly detach a flower from her bodice, or a medallion, and present it to someone with whom she would have liked to prolong the evening, with a melancholy feeling the while that such a prolongation could have led to nothing but idle talk, into which nothing could have passed of the nervous pleasure, the fleeting emotion, similar to the first warm days of spring in the impression they leave behind them of exhaustion and regret. As for the friend, it did not do for him to put too implicit a faith in the promises, more exhilarating than anything he had ever heard, tendered by these women who, because they feel with so much more force the sweetness of a moment, make of it, with a delicacy, a nobility of which normally constituted creatures are incapable, a compelling masterpiece of grace and goodness, and have no longer anything of themselves left to give when the next moment has arrived. Their affection does not outlive the exaltation that has dictated it; and the subtlety of mind which had then led them to divine all the things that you wished to hear and to say them to you will permit them just as easily, a few days later, to seize hold of your absurdities and use them to entertain another of their visitors with whom they will then be in the act of enjoying one of those \u2018musical moments\u2019 which are so brief\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the hall where I asked a footman for my snowboots which I had brought as a precaution against the snow, several flakes of which had already fallen, to be converted rapidly into slush, not having realised that they were hardly fashionable, I felt, at the contemptuous smile on all sides, a shame which rose to its highest pitch when I saw that Mme. de Parme had not gone and was watching me put on my American \u2018rubbers.\u2019 The Princess came towards me. \u201cOh! What a good idea,\u201d she exclaimed, \u201cit\u2019s so practical! There\u2019s a sensible man for you. Madame, we shall have to get a pair of those,\u201d she went on to her lady in waiting, while the mockery of the footmen turned to respect and the other guests crowded round me to inquire where I had managed to find these marvels. \u201cWith those on, you will have nothing to fear even if it starts snowing again and you have a long way to go. You\u2019re independent of the weather,\u201d said the Princess to me. \u201cOh! If it comes to that, your Royal Highness can be reassured,\u201d broke in the lady in waiting with a knowing air, \u201cit will not snow again.\u201d \u201cWhat do you know about it, Madame?\u201d came witheringly from the excellent Princesse de Parme, who alone could succeed in piercing the thick skin of her lady in waiting. \u201cI can assure your Royal Highness, it cannot snow again. It is a physical impossibility.\u201d \u201cBut why?\u201d \u201cIt cannot snow any more, they have taken the necessary steps to prevent it, they have put down salt in the streets!\u201d The simple-minded lady did not observe either the anger of the Princess or the mirth of the rest of her audience, for instead of remaining silent she said to me with a genial smile, paying no heed to my repeated denials of any connexion with Admiral Jurien de la Gravi\u00e8re: \u201cNot that it matters, after all. This gentleman must have stout sea-legs. What\u2019s bred in the bone!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Then, having escorted the Princesse de Parme to her carriage, M. de Guermantes said to me, taking hold of my greatcoat: \u201cLet me help you into your skin.\u201d He had ceased even to smile when he employed this expression, for those that were most vulgar had for that very reason, because of the Guermantes affectation of simplicity, become aristocratic\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0An exaltation that sank only into melancholy, because it was artificial, was what I also, although quite differently from Mme. de Guermantes, felt once I had finally left her house, in the carriage that was taking me to that of M. de Charlus. We can at pleasure abandon ourselves to one or other of two forces of which one rises in ourselves, emanates from our deepest impressions, the other comes to us from without. The first carries with it naturally a joy, the joy that springs from the life of the creator. The other current, that which endeavours to introduce into us the movement by which persons external to ourselves are stirred, is not accompanied by pleasure; but we can add a pleasure to it, by the shock of reaction, in an intoxication so feigned that it turns swiftly into boredom, into melancholy, whence the gloomy faces of so many men of fashion, and all those nervous conditions which may make them end in suicide. Well, in the carriage which was taking me to M. de Charlus, I was a prey to this second sort of exaltation, widely different from that which is given us by a personal impression, such as I had received in other carriages, once at Combray, in Dr. Percepied\u2019s gig, from which I had seen painted against the setting sun the spires of Martinville, another day at Balbec, in Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s barouche, when I strove to identify the reminiscence that was suggested to me by an avenue of trees. But in this third carriage, what I had before my mind\u2019s eye were those conversations that had seemed to me so tedious at Mme. de Guermante\u2019s dinner-table, for example Prince Von\u2019s stories about the German Emperor, General Botha and the British Army. I had slipped them into the frame of the internal stereoscope through the lenses of which, once we are no longer ourselves, once, endowed with the spirit of society, we no longer wish to receive our life save from other people, we cast into relief what they have said and done. Like a tipsy man filled with tender feeling for the waiter who has been serving him, I marvelled at my good fortune, a good fortune not realised by me, it is true, at the actual moment, in having dined with a person who knew William II so well, and had told stories about him that were \u2014 upon my word \u2014 really witty. And, as I repeated to myself, with the Prince\u2019s German accent, the story of General Botha, I laughed out loud, as though this laugh, like certain kinds of applause which increase one\u2019s inward admiration, were necessary to the story as a corroboration of its comic element. Through the magnifying lenses even those of Mme. de Guermantes\u2019s pronouncements which had struck me as being stupid (as for example that on the Hals pictures which one ought to see from the top of a tramway-car) took on a life, a depth that were extraordinary. And I must say that, even if this exaltation was quick to subside, it was not altogether unreasonable. Just as there may always come a day when we are glad to know the person whom we despise more than anyone in the world because he happens to be connected with a girl with whom we are in love, to whom he can introduce us, and thus offers us both utility and gratification, attributes in each of which we should have supposed him to be entirely lacking, so there is no conversation, any more than there are personal relations, from which we can be certain that we shall not one day derive some benefit. What Mme. de Guermantes had said to me about the pictures which it would be interesting to see, even from a tramway-car, was untrue, but it contained a germ of truth which was of value to me later on\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Similarly the lines of Victor Hugo which I had heard her quote were, it must be admitted, of a period earlier than that in which he became something more than a new man, in which he brought to light, in the order of evolution, a literary species till then unknown, endowed with more complex organs than any then in existence. In these first poems, Victor Hugo is still a thinker, instead of contenting himself, like Nature, with supplying food for thought. His \u2018thoughts\u2019 he at that time expressed in the most direct form, almost in the sense in which the Duke employed the word when, feeling it to be out of date and a nuisance that the guests at his big parties at Guermantes should, in the visitors\u2019 book, append to their signatures a philosophico-poetical reflexion, he used to warn novices in an appealing tone: \u201cYour name, my dear fellow, but no \u2018thoughts\u2019 please!\u201d Well, it was these \u2018thoughts\u2019 of Victor Hugo (almost as entirely absent from the L\u00e9gende des Si\u00e8cles as \u2018airs,\u2019 as \u2018melodies\u2019 are from Wagner\u2019s later manner) that Mme. de Guermantes admired in the early Hugo. Nor was she altogether wrong. They were touching, and already round about them, without their form\u2019s having yet the depth which it was to acquire only in later years, the rolling tide of words and of richly articulated rhymes put them beyond comparison with the lines that one might discover in a Corneille, for example, lines in which a Romanticism that is intermittent, restrained and so all the more moving, nevertheless has not at all penetrated to the physical sources of life, modified the unconscious and generalisable organism in which the idea is latent. And so I had been wrong in confining myself, hitherto, to the later volumes of Hugo. Of the earlier, of course, it was only a fractional part that Mme. de Guermantes used to embellish her conversation. But simply by quoting in this way an isolated line one multiplies its power of attraction tenfold. The lines that had entered or returned to my mind during this dinner magnetised in turn, summoned to themselves with such force the poems in the heart of which they were normally embedded, that my magnetised hands could not hold out for longer than forty-eight hours against the force that drew them towards the volume in which were bound up the Orientales and the Chants du Cr\u00e9puscule. I cursed Franchise\u2019s footman for having made a present to his native village of my copy of the Feuilles d\u2019Automne, and sent him off, with not a moment to be lost, to procure me another. I read these volumes from cover to cover and found peace of mind only when I suddenly came across, awaiting me in the light in which she had bathed them, the lines that I had heard Mme. de Guermantes quote. For all these reasons, conversations with the Duchess resembled the discoveries that we make in the library of a country house, out of date, incomplete, incapable of forming a mind, lacking in almost everything that we value, but offering us now and then some curious scrap of information, for instance the quotation of a fine passage which we did not know and as to which we are glad to remember in after years that we owe our knowledge of it to a stately mansion of the great. We are then, by having found Balzac\u2019s preface to the Chartreuse, or some unpublished letters of Joubert, tempted to exaggerate the value of the life we led there, the sterile frivolity of which, for this windfall of a single evening, we forget\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From this point of view, if the fashionable world had been unable, at the first moment, to provide what my imagination expected, and must consequently strike me first of all by what it had in common with all the other worlds rather than by its difference, still it revealed itself to me by degrees as something quite distinct. Great noblemen are almost the only people of whom one learns as much as one does of peasants; their conversation is adorned with everything that concerns the land, houses, as people used to live in them long ago, old customs, everything of which the world of money is profoundly ignorant. Even supposing that the aristocrat most moderate in his aspirations has finally overtaken the period in which he lives, his mother, his uncles, his great-aunts keep him in touch, when he recalls his childhood, with the conditions of a life almost unknown today. In the death-chamber of a contemporary corpse Mme. de Guermantes would not have pointed out, but would immediately have perceived, all the lapses from the traditional customs. She was shocked to see at a funeral women mingling with the men, when there was a particular ceremony which ought to be celebrated for the women. As for the pall, the use of which Bloch would doubtless have believed to be confined to coffins, on account of the pall bearers of whom one reads in the reports of funerals, M. de Guermantes could remember the time when, as a child, he had seen it borne at the wedding of M. de Mailly-Nesle. While Saint-Loup had sold his priceless \u2018Genealogical Tree,\u2019 old portraits of the Bouillons, letters of Louis XIII, in order to buy Carri\u00e8res and furniture in the modern style, M. and Mme. de Guermantes, moved by a sentiment in which the burning love of art may have played only a minor part, and which left them themselves more insignificant than before, had kept their marvellous Boule furniture, which presented a picture attractive in a different way to an artist. A literary man would similarly have been enchanted by their conversation, which would have been for him \u2014 for one hungry man has no need of another to keep him company \u2014 a living dictionary of all those expressions which every day are becoming more and more forgotten: Saint-Joseph cravats, children dedicated to the Blue, and so forth, which one finds to-day only among those people who have constituted themselves the friendly and benevolent custodians of the past. The pleasure that a writer, more than among other writers, feels among them is not without danger, for there is a risk of his coming to believe that the things of the past have a charm in themselves, of his transferring them bodily into his work, still-born in that case, exhaling a tedium for which he consoles himself with the reflexion: \u201cIt is attractive because it\u2019s true; that is how people do talk.\u201d These aristocratic conversations had moreover the charm, with Mme. de Guermantes, of being couched in excellent French. For this reason they made permissible on the Duchess\u2019s part her hilarity at the words \u2018viaticum,\u2019 \u2018cosmic,\u2019 \u2018pythian,\u2019 \u2018pre-eminent,\u2019 which Saint-Loup used to employ \u2014 as, similarly, at his Bing furniture\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When all was said, very different in this respect from what I had been able to feel before the hawthorns, or when I tasted a crumb of madeleine, the stories that I had heard at Mme. de Guermantes\u2019s remained alien to me. Entering for a moment into me, who was only physically possessed by them, one would have said that, being of a social, not an individual nature, they were impatient to escape. I writhed in my seat in the carriage like the priestess of an oracle. I looked forward to another dinner-party at which I might myself become a sort of Prince Von to Mme. de Guermantes, and repeat them. In the meantime they made my lips quiver as I stammered them to myself, and I tried in vain to bring back and concentrate a mind that was carried away by a centrifugal force. And so it was with a feverish impatience not to have to bear the whole weight of them any longer by myself in a carriage where, for that matter, I atoned for the lack of conversation by soliloquising aloud, that I rang the bell at M. de Charlus\u2019s door, and it was in long monologues with myself, in which I rehearsed everything that I was going to tell him and gave scarcely a thought to what he might have to say to me, that I spent the whole of the time during which I was kept waiting in a drawing-room into which a footman shewed me and where I was incidentally too much excited to look at what it contained. I felt so urgent a need that M. de Charlus should listen to the stories which I was burning to tell him that I was bitterly disappointed to think that the master of the house was perhaps in bed, and that I might have to go home to sleep off by myself my drunkenness of words. I had just noticed, in fact, that I had been twenty-five minutes \u2014 that they had perhaps forgotten about me \u2014 in this room of which, despite this long wait, I could at the most have said that it was very big, greenish in colour, and contained a large number of portraits. The need to speak prevents one not merely from listening but from seeing things, and in this case the absence of any description of my external surroundings is tantamount to a description of my internal state. I was preparing to leave the room to try to get hold of some one, and if I found no one to make my way back to the hall and have myself let out, when, just as I had risen from my chair and taken a few steps across the mosaic parquet of the floor, a manservant came in, with a troubled expression: \u201cMonsieur le Baron has been engaged all evening, Sir,\u201d he told me. \u201cThere are still several people waiting to see him. I am doing everything I possibly can to get him to receive you, I have already telephoned up twice to the secretary.\u201d \u201cNo; please don\u2019t bother. I had an appointment with M. le Baron, but it is very late already, and if he is busy this evening I can come back another day.\u201d \u201cOh no, Sir, you must not go away,\u201d cried the servant. \u201cM. le Baron might be vexed. I will try again.\u201d I was reminded of the things I had heard about M. de Charlus\u2019s servants and their devotion to their master. One could not quite say of him as of the Prince de Conti that he sought to give pleasure as much to the valet as to the Minister, but he had shewn such skill in making of the least thing that he asked of them a sort of personal favour that at night, when, his body-servants assembled round him at a respectful distance, after running his eye over them he said: \u201cCoignet, the candlestick!\u201d or \u201cDucret, the nightshirt!\u201d it was with an envious murmur that the rest used to withdraw, jealous of him who had been singled out by his master\u2019s favour. Two of them, indeed, who could not abide one another, used to try to snatch the favour each from his rival by going on the most flimsy pretext with a message to the Baron, if he had gone upstairs earlier than usual, in the hope of being invested for the evening with the charge of candlestick or nightshirt. If he addressed a few words directly to one of them on some subject outside the scope of his duty, still more if in winter, in the garden, knowing that one of his coachmen had caught cold, he said to him, after ten minutes: \u201cPut your cap on!\u201d the others would not speak to the fellow again for a fortnight, in their jealousy of the great distinction that had been conferred on him. I waited ten minutes more, and then, after requesting me not to stay too long as M. le Baron was tired and had had to send away several most important people who had made appointments with him many days before, they admitted me to his presence. This setting with which M. de Charlus surrounded himself seemed to me a great deal less impressive than the simplicity of his brother Guermantes, but already the door stood open, I could see the Baron, in a Chinese dressing-gown, with his throat bare, lying upon a sofa. My eye was caught at the same moment by a tall hat, its nap flashing like a mirror, which had been left on a chair with a cape, as though the Baron had but recently come in. The valet withdrew. I supposed that M. de Charlus would rise to greet me. Without moving a muscle he fixed on me a pair of implacable eyes. I went towards him, I said good evening; he did not hold out his hand, made no reply, did not ask me to take a chair. After a moment\u2019s silence I asked him, as one would ask an ill-mannered doctor, whether it was necessary for me to remain standing. I said this without any evil intention, but my words seemed only to intensify the cold fury on M. de Charlus\u2019s face. I was not aware, as it happened, that at home, in the country, at the Ch\u00e2teau de Charlus, he was in the habit, after dinner (so much did he love to play the king) of sprawling in an armchair in the smoking-room, letting hi3 guests remain standing round him. He would ask for a light from one, offer a cigar to another and then, after a few minutes\u2019 interval, would say: \u201cBut Argencourt, why don\u2019t you sit down? Take a chair, my dear fellow,\u201d and so forth, having made a point of keeping them standing simply to remind them that it was from himself that permission came to them to be seated. \u201cPut yourself in the Louis XIV seat,\u201d he answered me with an imperious air, as though rather to force me to move away farther from himself than to invite me to be seated. I took an armchair which was comparatively near. \u201cAh! so that is what you call a Louis XIV seat, is it? I can see you have been well educated,\u201d he cried in derision. I was so much taken aback that I did not move, either to leave the house, as I ought to have done, or to change my seat, as he wished. \u201cSir,\u201d he next said to me, weighing each of his words, to the more impertinent of which he prefixed a double yoke of consonants, \u201cthe interview which I have condescended to grant you at the request of a person who desires to be nameless, will mark the final point in our relations. I shall not conceal from you that I had hoped for better things! I should perhaps be forcing the sense of the words a little, which one ought not to do, even with people who are ignorant of their value, simply out of the respect due to oneself, were I to tell you that I had felt a certain attraction towards you. I think, however, that benevolence, in its most actively protecting sense, would exceed neither what I felt nor what I was proposing to display. I had, immediately on my return to Paris, given you to understand, while you were still at Balbec, that you could count upon me.\u201d I who remembered with what a torrent of abuse M. de Charlus had parted from me at Balbec made an instinctive gesture of contradiction. \u201cWhat!\u201d he cried with fury, and indeed his face, convulsed and white, differed as much from his ordinary face as does the sea when on a morning of storm one finds instead of its customary smiling surface a thousand serpents writhing in spray and foam, \u201cdo you mean to pretend that you did not receive my message \u2014 almost a declaration \u2014 that you were to remember me? What was there in the way of decoration round the cover of the book that I sent you?\u201d \u201cSome very pretty twined garlands with tooled ornaments,\u201d I told him. \u201cAh!\u201d he replied, with an air of scorn, \u201cthese young Frenchmen know little of the treasures of our land. What would be said of a young Berliner who had never heard of the Walk\u00fcre? Besides, you must have eyes to see and see not, since you yourself told me that you had stood for two hours in front of that particular treasure. I can see that you know no more about flowers than you do about styles; don\u2019t protest that you know about styles,\u201d he cried in a shrill scream of rage, \u201cyou can\u2019t even tell me what you are sitting on. You offer your hindquarters a Directorychauffeuse as a Louis XIV berg\u00e8re. One of these days you\u2019ll be mistaking Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s knees for the seat of the rear, and a fine mess you\u2019ll make of things then. It\u2019s precisely the same; you didn\u2019t even recognise on the binding of Bergotte\u2019s book the lintel of myosotis over the door of Balbec church. Could there be any clearer way of saying to you: \u2018Forget me not!\u2019?\u201d I looked at M. de Charlus. Undoubtedly his magnificent head, though repellent, yet far surpassed that of any of his relatives; you would have called him an Apollo grown old; but an olive-hued, bilious juice seemed ready to start from the corners of his evil mouth; as for intellect, one could not deny that his, over a vast compass, had taken in many things which must always remain unknown to his brother Guermantes. But whatever the fine words with which he coloured all his hatreds, one felt that, even if there was now an offended pride, now a disappointment in love, or a rancour, or sadism, a love of teasing, a fixed obsession, this man was capable of doing murder, and of proving by force of logic that he had been right in doin^ it and was still superior by a hundred cubits in moral stature to his brother, his sister-in-law, or any of the rest. \u201cJust as, in Velazquez\u2019sLances,\u201d he went on, \u201cthe victor advances towards him who is the humbler in rank, as is the duty of every noble nature, since I was everything and you were nothing, it was I who took the first steps towards you. You have made an idiotic reply to what it is not for me to describe as an act of greatness. But I have not allowed myself to be discouraged. Our religion inculcates patience. The patience I have shewn towards you will be counted, I hope, to my credit, and also my having only smiled at what might be denounced as impertinence, were it within your power to offer any impertinence to me who surpass you in stature by so many cubits; but after all, Sir, all this is now neither here nor there. I have subjected you to the test which the one eminent man of our world has ingeniously named the test of excessive friendliness, and which he rightly declares to be the most terrible of all, the only one that can separate the good grain from the tares. I could scarcely reproach you for having undergone it without success, for those who emerge from it triumphant are very few. But at least, and this is the conclusion which I am entitled to draw from the last words that we shall exchange on this earth, at least I intend to hear nothing more of your calumnious fabrications.\u201d So far, I had never dreamed that M. de Charlus\u2019s rage could have been caused by an unflattering remark which had been repeated to him; I searched my memory; I had not spoken about him to anyone. Some evil-doer had invented the whole thing. I protested to-M. de Charlus that I had said absolutely nothing about him. \u201cI don\u2019t think I can have annoyed you by saying to Mme. de Guermantes that I was a friend of yours.\u201d He gave a disdainful smile, made his voice climb to the supreme pitch of its highest register, and there, without strain, attacking the shrillest and most insolent note: \u201cOh! Sir,\u201d he said, returning by the most gradual stages to a natural intonation, and seeming to revel as he went in the oddities of this descending scale, \u201cI think that you are doing yourself an injustice when you accuse yourself of having said that we were friends. I do not look for any great verbal accuracy in anyone who could readily mistake a piece of Chippendale for a rococo chaire, but really I do not believe,\u201d he went on, with vocal caresses that grew more and more winning and brought to hover over his lips what was actually a charming smile, \u201cI do not believe that you can ever have said, or thought, that we were frlends! As for your having boasted that you had been presented to me, had talked to me, knew me slightly, had obtained, almost without solicitation, the prospect of coming one day under my protection, I find it on the contrary very natural and intelligent of you to have done so. The extreme difference in age that there is between us enables me to recognise without absurdity that thatpresentation, those talks, that vague prospect of future relations were for you, it is not for me to say an honour, but still, when all is said and done, an advantage as to which I consider that your folly lay not in divulging it but in not having had the sense to keep it. I will go so far as to say,\u201d he went on, passing abruptly for a moment from his arrogant wrath to a gentleness so tinged with melancholy that I expected him to burst into tears, \u201cthat when you left unanswered the proposal I made to you here in Paris it seemed to me so unheard-of an act on your part, coming from you who had struck me as well brought up and of a good bourgeois family,\u201d (on this adjective alone his voice sounded a little whistle of impertinence) \u201cthat I was foolish enough to imagine all the excuses that never really happen, letters miscarrying, addresses copied down wrong. I can see that on my part it was great foolishness, but Saint Bonaventure preferred to believe that an ox could fly rather than that his brother was capable of lying. Anyhow, that is all finished now, the idea did not attract you, there is no more to be said. It seems to me only that you might have brought yourself,\u201d (and there was a genuine sound of weeping in his voice) \u201cwere it only out of consideration for my age, to write to me. I had conceived and planned for you certain infinitely seductive things, which I had taken good care not to tell you. You have preferred to refuse without knowing what they were; that is your affair. But, as I tell you, one can always write. In your place, and indeed in my own, I should have done so. I like my place, for that reason, better than yours \u2014 I say \u2018for that reason\u2019 because I believe that we are all equal, and I have more fellow-feeling for an intelligent labourer than for many of our dukes. But I can say that I prefer my place to yours, because what you have done, in the whole course of my life, which is beginning now to be a pretty long one, I am conscious that I have never done.\u201d His head was turned away from the light, and I could not see if his eyes were dropping tears as I might have supposed from his voice. \u201cI told you that I had taken a hundred steps towards you; the only effect of that has been to make you retire two hundred from me. Now it is for me to withdraw, and we shall know one another no longer. I shall retain not your name but your story, so that at moments when I might be tempted to believe that men have good hearts, good manners, or simply the intelligence not to allow an unparalleled opportunity to escape them, I may remember that that is ranking them too highly. No, that you should have said that you knew me, when it was true \u2014 for henceforward it ceases to be true \u2014 I regard that as only natural, and I take it as an act of homage, that is to say something pleasant. Unfortunately, elsewhere and in other circumstances, you have uttered remarks of a very different nature.\u201d \u201cSir, I swear to you that I have said nothing that could insult you.\u201d \u201cAnd who says that I am insulted?\u201d he cried with fury, flinging himself into an erect posture on the seat on which hitherto he had been reclining motionless, while, as the pale frothing serpents stiffened in his face, his voice became alternately shrill and grave, like the deafening onrush of a storm. (The force with which he habitually spoke, which used to make strangers turn round in the street, was multiplied an hundredfold, as is a musical forte if, instead of being played on the piano, it is played by an orchestra, and changed into afortissimo as well. M. de Charlus roared.) \u201cDo you suppose that it is within your power to insult me? You evidently are not aware to whom you are speaking? Do you imagine that the envenomed spittle of five hundred little gentlemen of your type, heaped one upon another, would succeed in slobbering so much as the tips of my august toes?\u201d A moment before this my desire to persuade M. de Charlus that I had never said, nor heard anyone else say any evil of him had given place to a mad rage, caused by the words which were dictated to him solely, to my mind, by his colossal pride. Perhaps they were indeed the effect, in part at any rate, of this pride. Almost all the rest sprang from a feeling of which I was then still ignorant, and for which I could not therefore be blamed for not making due allowance. I could at least, failing this unknown element, have mingled with his pride, had I remembered the words of Mme. de Guermantes, a trace of madness. But at that moment the idea of madness never even entered my head. There was in him, according to me, only pride, in me there was only fury. This fury (at the moment when M. de Charlus ceased to shout, in order to refer to his august toes, with a majesty that was accompanied by a grimace, a nausea of disgust at his obscure blasphemers), this fury could contain itself no longer. With an impulsive movement, I wanted to strike something, and, a lingering trace of discernment making me respect the person of a man so much older than myself, and even, in view of their dignity as works of art, the pieces of German porcelain that were grouped around him, I flung myself upon the Baron\u2019s new silk hat, dashed it to the ground, trampled upon it, began blindly pulling it to pieces, wrenched off the brim, tore the crown in two, without heeding the vociferations of M. de Charlus, which continued to sound, and, crossing the room to leave it, opened the door. One on either side of it, to my intense stupefaction, stood two footmen, who moved slowly away, so as to appear only to have been casually passing in the course of their duty. (I afterwards learned their names; one was called Burnier, the other Charmel.) I was not taken in for a moment by this explanation which their leisurely gait seemed to offer me. It was highly improbable; three others appeared to me to be less so; one that the Baron sometimes entertained guests against whom, as he might happen to need assistance (but why?), he deemed it necessary to keep reinforcements posted close at hand. The second was that, drawn by curiosity, they had stopped to listen at the keyhole, not thinking that I should come out so quickly. The third, that, the whole of the scene which M. de Charlus had made with me having been prepared and acted, he had himself told them to listen, from a love of the spectacular combined, perhaps, with a \u2018nunc crudimini\u2018 from which each would derive a suitable profit\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My anger had not calmed that of M. de Charlus, my departure from the room seemed to cause him acute distress; he called me back, made his servants call me back, and finally, forgetting that a moment earlier, when he spoke of his \u2018august toes,\u2019 he had thought to make me a witness of his own deification, came running after me at full speed, overtook me in the hall, and stood barring the door. \u201cThere, now,\u201d he said, \u201cdon\u2019t be childish; come back for a minute; he who loveth well chasteneth well, and if I have chastened you well it is because I love you well.\u201d My anger had subsided; I let the word \u2018chasten\u2019 pass, and followed the Baron, who, summoning a footman, ordered him without a trace of self-consciousness to clear away the remains of the shattered hat, which was replaced by another. \u201cIf you will tell me, Sir, who it is that has treacherously maligned me,\u201d I said to M. de Charlus, \u201cI will stay here to learn his name and to confute the impostor.\u201d \u201cWho? Do you not know? Do you retain no memory of the things you say? Do you think that the people who do me the service of informing me of those things do not begin by demanding secrecy? And do you imagine that I am going to betray a person to whom I have given my promise?\u201d \u201cSir, is it impossible then for you to tell me?\u201d I asked, racking my brains in a final effort to discover (and discovering no one) to whom I could have spoken about M. de Charlus. \u201cYou did not hear me say that I had given a promise of secrecy to my informant?\u201d he said in a snapping voice. \u201cI see that with your fondness for abject utterances you combine one for futile persistence. You ought to have at least the intelligence to profit by a final conversation, and so to speak as to say something that does not mean precisely nothing.\u201d \u201cSir,\u201d I replied, moving away from him, \u201cyou insult me; I am unarmed, because you are several times my age, we are not equally matched; on the other hand, I cannot convince you; I have already sworn to you that I have said nothing.\u201d \u201cI am lying, then, am I?\u201d he cried in a terrifying tone, and with a bound forwards that brought him within a yard of myself. \u201cSome one has misinformed you.\u201d Then in a gentle, affectionate, melancholy voice, as in those symphonies which are played without any break between the different movements, in which a gracefulscherzo, amiable and idyllic, follows the thunder-peals of the opening pages: \u201cIt is quite possible,\u201d he told me. \u201cGenerally speaking, a remark repeated at second hand is rarely true. It is your fault if, not having profited by the opportunities of seeing me which I had held out to you, you have not furnished me, by that open speech of daily intercourse which creates confidence, with the unique and sovereign remedy against a spoken word which made you out a traitor. Either way, true or false, the remark has done its work. I can never again rid myself of the impression it made on me. I cannot even say that he who chasteneth well loveth well, for I have chastened you well enough but I no longer love you.\u201d While saying this he had forced me to sit down and had rung the bell. A different footman appeared. \u201cBring something to drink and order the brougham.\u201d I said that I was not thirsty and besides had a carriage waiting. \u201cThey have probably paid him and sent him away,\u201d he told me, \u201cyou needn\u2019t worry about that. I am ordering a carriage to take you home. . . . If you\u2019re anxious about the time . . . I could have given you a room here. . . . \u201d I said that my mother would be uneasy. \u201cAh! Of course, yes. Well, true or false, the remark has done its work. My affection, a trifle premature, had flowered too soon, and, like those apple trees of which you spoke so poetically at Balbec, it has been unable to withstand the first frost.\u201d If M. de Charlus\u2019s affection for me had not been destroyed, he could hardly have acted differently, since, while assuring me that we were no longer acquainted, he made me sit down, drink, asked me to stay the night, and was going now to send me home. He had indeed an air of dreading the moment at which he must part from me and find himself alone, that sort of slightly anxious fear which his sister-in-law and cousin Guermantes had appeared to me to be feeling when she had tried to force me to stay a little longer, with something of the same momentary fondness for myself, of the same effort to prolong the passing minute. \u201cUnfortunately,\u201d he went on, \u201cI have not the power to make blossom again what has once been destroyed. My affection for you is quite dead. Nothing can revive it. I believe that it is not unworthy of me to confess that I regret it. I always feel myself to be a little like Victor Hugo\u2019s Boaz: \u2018I am widowed and alone, and the darkness gathers o\u2019er me.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I passed again with him through the big green drawing-room. I told him, speaking quite at random, how beautiful I thought it. \u201cAin\u2019t it?\u201d he replied. \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing to be fond of something. The woodwork is Bagard. What is rather charming, d\u2019you see, is that it was made to match the Beauvais chairs and the consoles. You observe, it repeats the same decorative design. There used to be only two places where you could see this, the Louvre and M. d\u2019Hinnisdal\u2019s house. But naturally, as soon as I had decided to come and live in this street, there cropped up an old family house of the Chimays which nobody had ever seen before because it came here expressly for me. On the whole, it\u2019s good. It might perhaps be better, but after all it\u2019s not bad. Some pretty things, ain\u2019t there? These are portraits of my uncles, the King of Poland and the King of England, by Mignard. But why am I telling you all this? You must know it as well as I do, you were waiting in this room. No? Ah, then they must have put you in the blue drawing-room,\u201d he said with an air that might have been either impertinence, on the score of my want of interest, or personal superiority, in not having taken the trouble to ask where I had been kept waiting. \u201cLook now, in this cabinet I have all the hats worn by Mlle. Elisabeth, by the Princesse de Lamballe, and by the Queen. They don\u2019t interest you, one would think you couldn\u2019t see. Perhaps you are suffering from an affection of the optic nerve. If you like this kind of beauty better, here is a rainbow by Turner beginning to shine out between these two Rembrandts, as a sign of our reconciliation. You hear: Beethoven has come to join him.\u201d And indeed one could hear the first chords of the third part of the Pastoral Symphony, \u2018Joy after the Storm,\u2019 performed somewhere not far away, on the first landing no doubt, by a band of musicians. I innocently inquired how they happened to be playing that, and who the musicians were. \u201cAh, well, one doesn\u2019t know. One never does know. They are unseen music. Pretty, ain\u2019t it?\u201d he said to me in a slightly impertinent tone, which, nevertheless, suggested somehow the influence and accent of Swann. \u201cBut you care about as much for it as a fish does for little apples. You want to go home, regardless of any want of respect for Beethoven or for me. You are uttering your own judgment and condemnation,\u201d he added, with an affectionate and mournful air, when the moment had come for me to go. \u201cYou will excuse my not accompanying you home, as good manners ordain that I should,\u201d he said to me. \u201cSince I have decided not to see you again, spending five minutes more in your company would make very little difference to me. But I am tired, and I have a great deal to do.\u201d And then, seeing that it was a fine night: \u201cVery well, yes, I will come in the carriage, there is a superb moon which I shall go on to admire from the Bois after I have taken you home. What, you don\u2019t know how to shave; even on a night when you\u2019ve been dining out, you have still a few hairs here,\u201d he said, taking my chin between two fingers, so to speak magnetised, which after a moment\u2019s resistance ran up to my ears, like the fingers of a barber. \u201cAh! It would be pleasant to look at the \u2018blue light of the moon\u2019 in the Bois with some one like yourself,\u201d he said to me with a sudden and almost involuntary gentleness, then, in a sadder tone: \u201cFor you are nice, all the same; you could be nicer than anyone,\u201d he went on, laying his hand in a fatherly way on my shoulder. \u201cOriginally, I must say that I found you quite insignificant.\u201d I ought to have reflected that he must find me so still. I had only to recall the rage with which he had spoken to me, barely half an hour before. In spite of this I had the impression that he was, for the moment, sincere, that his kindness of heart was prevailing over what I regarded as an almost delirious condition of susceptibility and pride. The carriage was waiting beside us, and still he prolonged the conversation. \u201cCome along,\u201d he said abruptly, \u201cjump in, in five minutes we shall be at your door. And I shall bid you a good night which will cut short our relations, and for all time. It is better, since we must part for ever, that we should do so, as in music, on a perfect chord.\u201d Despite these solemn affirmations that we should never see one another again, I could have sworn that M. de Charlus, annoyed at having forgotten himself earlier in the evening and afraid of having hurt my feelings, would not have been displeased to see me once again. Nor was I mistaken, for, a moment later: \u201cThere, now,\u201d he said, \u201cif I hadn\u2019t forgotten the most important thing of all. In memory of your grandmother, I have had bound for you a curious edition of Mme. de S\u00e9vign\u00e9. That is what is going to prevent this from being our last meeting. One must console oneself with the reflexion that complicated affairs are rarely settled in a day. Just look how long they took over the Congress of Vienna.\u201d \u201cBut I could call for it without disturbing you,\u201d I said obligingly. \u201cWill you hold your tongue, you little fool,\u201d he replied with anger, \u201cand not give yourself a grotesque appearance of regarding as a small matter the honour of being probably (I do not say certainly, for it will perhaps be one of my servants who hands you the volumes) received by me.\u201d Then, regaining possession of himself: \u201cI do not wish to part from you on these words. No dissonance, before the eternal silence of the dominant.\u201d It was for his own nerves that he seemed to dread an immediate return home after harsh words of dissension. \u201cYou would not care to come to the Bois?\u201d he addressed me in a tone not so much interrogative as affirmative, and that not, as it seemed to me, because he did not wish to make me the offer but because he was afraid that his self-esteem might meet with a refusal. \u201cOh, very well,\u201d he went on, still postponing our separation, \u201cit is the moment when, as Whistler says, the bourgeois go to bed\u201d (perhaps he wished now to capture me by my self-esteem) \u201cand the right time to begin to look at things. But you don\u2019t even know who Whistler was!\u201d I changed the conversation and asked him whether the Princesse d\u2019I\u00e9na was an intelligent person. M. de Charlus stopped me, and, adopting the most contemptuous tone that I had yet heard him use, \u201cOh! There, Sir,\u201d he informed me, \u201cyou are alluding to an order of nomenclature with which I have no concern. There is perhaps an aristocracy among the Tahitians, but I must confess that I know nothing about it. The name which you have just mentioned, strangely enough, did sound in my ears only a few days ago. Some one asked me whether I would condescend to allow them to present to me the young Duc de Guastalla. The request astonished me, for the Duc de Guastalla has no need to get himself presented to me, for the simple reason that he is my cousin, and has known me all his life; he is the son of the Princesse de Parme, and, as a young kinsman of good upbringing, he never fails to come and pay his respects to me on New Year\u2019s Day. But, on making inquiries, I discovered that it was not my relative who was meant but the son of the person in whom you are interested. As there exists no Princess of that title, I supposed that my friend was referring to some poor wanton sleeping under the Pont d\u2019I\u00e9na, who had picturesquely assumed the title of Princesse d\u2019I\u00e9na, just as one talks about the Panther of the Batignolles, or the Steel King. But no, the reference was to a rich person who possesses some remarkable furniture which I had seen and admired at an exhibition, and which has this advantage over the name of its owner that it is genuine. As for this self-styled Duc de Guastalla, he, I supposed, must be my secretary\u2019s stockbroker; one can procure so many things with money. But no; it was the Emperor, it appears, who amused himself by conferring on these people a title which simply was not his to give. It was perhaps a sign of power, or of ignorance, or of malice; in any case, I consider, it was an exceedingly scurvy trick to play on these unconscious usurpers. But really, I cannot help you by throwing any light on the matter; my knowledge begins and ends with the Faubourg Saint-Germain, where, among all the Courvoisiers and Gallardons, you will find, if you can manage to secure an introduction, plenty of mangy old cats taken straight out of Balzac who will amuse you. Naturally, all that has nothing to do with the position of the Princesse de Guermantes, but without me and my \u2018Open, Sesame\u2019 her portals are unapproachable.\u201d \u201cIt is really very lovely, isn\u2019t it, Sir, the Princesse de Guermantes\u2019s mansion?\u201d \u201cOh, it\u2019s not very lovely. It\u2019s the loveliest thing in the world. Next to the Princess herself, of course.\u201d \u201cThe Princesse de Guermantes is better than the Duchesse de Guermantes?\u201d \u201cOh! There\u2019s no comparison.\u201d (It is to be observed that, whenever people in society have the least touch of imagination, they will crown or dethrone, to suit their affections or their quarrels, those whose position appeared most solid and unalterably fixed.)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThe Duchesse de Guermantes\u201d (possibly, in not calling her \u2018Oriane,\u2019 he wished to set a greater distance between her and myself) \u201cis delightful, far superior to anything you can have guessed. But, after all, she is incommensurable with her cousin. The Princess is exactly what the people in the Markets might imagine Princess Metternich to have been, but old Metternich believed she had started Wagner, because she knew Victor Maurel. The Princesse de Guermantes, or rather her mother, knew the man himself. Which is a distinction, not to mention the incredible beauty of the lady. And the Esther gardens alone!\u201d \u201cOne can\u2019t see them?\u201d \u201cNo, you would have to be invited, but they never invite anyone unless I intervene.\u201d But at once withdrawing, after casting it at me, the bait of this offer, he held out his hand, for we had reached my door. \u201cMy part is played, Sir, I will simply add these few words. Another person will perhaps some day offer you his affection, as I have done. Let the present example serve for your instruction. Do not neglect it. Affection is always precious. What one cannot do by oneself in this life, because there are things which one cannot ask, nor do, nor wish, nor learn by oneself, one can do in company, and without needing to be Thirteen, as in Balzac\u2019s story, or Four, as in The Three Musketeers. Good-bye.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He must have been feeling tired and have abandoned the idea of going to look at the moonlight, for he asked me to tell his coachman to drive home. At once he made a sharp movement as though he had changed his mind. But I had already given the order, and, so as not to lose any more time, went across now to ring the bell, without its entering my head that I had been meaning to tell M. de Charlus, about the German Emperor and General Botha, stories which had been an hour ago such an obsession but which his unexpected and crushing reception had sent flying far out of my mind\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On entering my room I saw on my desk a letter which Franchise\u2019s young footman had written to one of his friends and had left lying there. Now that my mother was away, there was no liberty which he had the least hesitation in taking; I was the more to blame of the two for taking that of reading the letter which, without an envelope, lay spread out before me and (which was my sole excuse) seemed to offer itself to my eye\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDear Friend and Cousin\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI hope this finds you in good health, and the same with all the young folk, particularly my young godson Joseph whom I have not yet had the pleasure of meeting but whom I prefer to you all as being my godson, these relics of the heart they have their dust also, upon their blest remains let us not lay our hands. Besides dear friend and cousin who can say that to-morrow you and your dear wife my cousin Marie, will not both of you be cast headlong down into the bottom of the sea, like the sailor clinging to the mast on high, for this life is but a dark valley. Dear friend I must tell you that my principal occupation, which will astonish you I am certain, is now poetry which I love passionately, for one must somehow pass the time away. And so dear friend do not be too surprised if I have not answered your last letter before now, in place of pardon let oblivion come. As you are aware, Madame\u2019s mother has passed away amid unspeakable sufferings which fairly exhausted her as she saw as many as three doctors. The day of her interment was a great day for all Monsieur\u2019s relations came in crowds as well as several Ministers. It took them more than two hours to get to the cemetery, which will make you all open your eyes pretty wide in your village for they certainly won\u2019t do as much for mother Michu. So all my life to come can be but one long sob. I am amusing myself enormously with the motorcycle of which I have recently learned. What would you say, my dear friends, if I arrived suddenly like that at full speed at Les Ecorces. But on that head I shall no more keep silence for I feel that the frenzy of grief sweeps its reason away. I am associating with the Duchesse de Guermantes, people whose very names you have never heard in our ignorant villages. Therefore it is with pleasure that I am going to send the works of Racine, of Victor Hugo, of Pages Choisies de Chenedolle, of Alfred de Musset, for I would cure the land in which I saw the light of ignorance which leads unerringly to crime. I can think of nothing more to say to you and send you like the pelican wearied by a long flight my best regards as well as to your wife my godson and your sister Rose. May it never be said of her: And Rose she lived only as live the roses, as has been said by Victor Hugo, the sonnet of Arvers, Alfred de Musset, all those great geniuses who for that cause have had to die upon the blazing scaffold like Jeanne d\u2019Arc. Hoping for your next letter soon, receive my kisses like those of a brother\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cP\u00e9rigot (Joseph).\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We are attracted by every form of life which represents to us something unknown and strange, by a last illusion still unshattered. In spite of this, the mysterious utterances by means of which M. de Charlus had led me to imagine the Princesse de Guermantes as an extraordinary creature, different from anyone that I knew, were not sufficient to account for the stupefaction in which I was plunged, speedily followed by the fear that I might be the victim of some bad joke planned by some one who wanted to send me to the door of a house to which I had not been invited, when, about two months after my dinner with the Duchess and while she was at Cannes, having opened an envelope the appearance of which had not led me to suppose that it contained anything out of the common, I read the following words engraved on a card: \u201cThe Princesse de Guermantes,n\u00e9e Duchesse en Bavi\u00e8re, At Home, the \u2014\u2014-th.\u201d No doubt to be invited to the Princesse de Guermantes\u2019s was perhaps not, from the social point of view, any more difficult than to dine with the Duchess, and my slight knowledge of heraldry had taught me that the title of Prince is not superior to that of Duke. Besides, I told myself that the intelligence of a society woman could not be essentially so heterogeneous to that of her congeners as M. de Charlus made out, nor so heterogeneous to that of any one other woman in society. But my imagination, like Elstir engaged upon rendering some effect of perspective without reference to a knowledge of the laws of nature which he might quite well possess, depicted for me not what I knew but what it saw; what it saw, that is to say what the name shewed it. Now, even before I had met the Duchess, the name Guermantes preceded by the title of Princess, like a note or a colour or quantity, profoundly modified from the surrounding values by the mathematical or aesthetic sign that governs it, had already suggested to me something entirely different. With that title one finds one\u2019s thoughts straying instinctively to the memoirs of the days of Louis XIII and Louis XIV, the English Court, the Queen of Scots, the Duchesse d\u2019Aumale; and I imagined the town house of the Princesse de Guermantes as more or less frequented by the Duchesse de Longueville and the great Cond\u00e9, whose presence there rendered it highly improbable that I should ever make my way into it\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Many of the things that M. de Charlus had told me had driven a vigorous spur into my imagination and, making it forget how much the reality had disappointed me at Mme. de Guermantes\u2019s (people\u2019s names are in this respect like the names of places), had swung it towards Oriane\u2019s cousin. For that matter, M. de Charlus misled me at times as to the imaginary value and variety of people in society only because he was himself at times misled. And this, perhaps, because he did nothing, did not write, did not paint, did not even read anything in a serious and thorough manner. But, superior by several degrees to the people in society, if it was from them and the spectacle they afforded that he drew the material for his conversation, he was not for that reason understood by them. Speaking as an artist, he could at the most reveal the fallacious charm of people in society. But reveal it to artists alone, with relation to whom he might be said to play the part played by the reindeer among the Esquimaux. This precious animal plucks for them from the barren rocks lichens and mosses which they themselves could neither discover nor utilise, but which, once they have been digested by the reindeer, become for the inhabitants of the far North a nourishing form of food\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To which I may add that the pictures which M. de Charlus drew of society were animated with plenty of life by the blend of his ferocious hatreds and his passionate affections. Hatreds directed mainly against the young men, adoration aroused principally by certain women\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If among these the Princesse de Guermantes was placed by M. de Charlus upon the most exalted throne, his mysterious words about the \u2018unapproachable Aladdin\u2019s palace\u2019 in which his cousin dwelt were not sufficient to account for my stupefaction. Apart from whatever may be due to the divers subjective points of view, of which I shall have to speak later, in these artificial magnifications, the fact remains that there is a certain objective reality in each of these people, and consequently a difference among them. And how, when it comes to that, could it be otherwise? The humanity with which we consort and which bears so little resemblance to our dreams is, for all that, the same that, in the Memoirs, in the Letters of eminent persons, we have seen described and have felt a desire to know. The old man of complete insignificance whom we met at dinner is the same who wrote that proud letter, which (in a book on the War of 1870) we read with emotion, to Prince Friedrich-Karl. We are bored at a dinner-table because our imagination is absent, and because it is bearing us company we are interested in a book. But the people in question are the same. We should like to have known Mme. de Pompadour, who was so valuable a patron of the arts, and we should have been as much bored in her company as among the modern Egerias, at whose houses we cannot bring ourselves to pay a second call, so uninteresting do we find them. The fact remains, nevertheless, that these differences do exist. People are never exactly similar to one another, their mode of behaviour with regard to ourselves, at, one might say, the same level of friendship, reveals differences which, in the end, offer compensations. When I knew Mme. de Montmorency, she loved to say unpleasant things to me, but if I was in need of a service she would squander, in the hope of obtaining it for me effectively, all the credit at her disposal, without counting the cost. Whereas some other woman, Mme. de Guermantes for example, would never have wished to hurt my feelings, never said anything about me except what might give me pleasure, showered on me all those tokens of friendship which formed the rich manner of living, morally, of the Guermantes, but, had I asked her for the least thing above and beyond that, would not have moved an inch to procure it for me, as in those country houses where one has at one\u2019s disposal a motor-car and a special footman, but where it is impossible to obtain a glass of cider, for which no provision has been made in the arrangements for a party. Which was for me the true friend, Mme. de Montmorency, so glad always to annoy me and always so ready to oblige, or Mme. de Guermantes, distressed by the slightest offence that might have been given me and incapable of the slightest effort to be of use to me? The types of the human mind are so varied, so opposite, not only in literature but in society, that Baudelaire and M\u00e9rim\u00e9e are not the only people who have the right to despise one another mutually. These peculiarities continue to form in everyone a system of attitudes, of speech, of actions, so coherent, so despotic, that when we are in the presence of anyone his or her system seems to us superior to the rest. With Mme. de Guermantes, her words, deduced like a theorem from her type of mind, seemed to me the only ones that could possibly be said. And I was, at heart, of her opinion when she told me that Mme. de Montmorency was stupid and kept an open mind towards all the things she did not understand, or when, having heard of some spiteful remark by that lady, she said: \u201cThat is what you call a good woman; it is what I call a monster.\u201d But this tyranny of the reality which confronts us, this preponderance of the lamplight which turns the dawn \u2014 already distant \u2014 as pale as the faintest memory, disappeared when I was away from Mme. de Guermantes, and a different lady said to me, putting herself on my level and reckoning the Duchess as placed far below either of us: \u201cOriane takes no interest, really, in anything or anybody,\u201d or even (what in the presence of Mme. de Guermantes it would have seemed impossible to believe, so loudly did she herself proclaim the opposite): \u201cOriane is a snob.\u201d Seeing that no mathematical process would have enabled one to convert Mme. d\u2019Arpajon and Mme. de Montpensier into commensurable quantities, it would have been impossible for me to reply, had anyone asked me which of the two seemed to me superior to the other\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Now, among the peculiar characteristics of the drawing-room of the Princesse de Guermantes, the one most generally quoted was a certain exclusiveness, due in part to the royal birth of the Princess, but especially to the almost fossilised rigidity of the aristocratic prejudices of the Prince, prejudices which, incidentally, the Duke and Duchess had made no scruple about deriding in front of me, and which naturally were to make me regard it as more improbable than ever that I should have been invited to a party by this man who reckoned only in royalties and dukes, and at every dinner-party made a scene because he had not been put in the place to which he would have been entitled under Louis XIV, a place which, thanks to his immense erudition in matters of history and genealogy, he was the only person who knew. For this reason, many of the people in society placed to the credit of the Duke and Duchess the differences which distinguished them from their cousins. \u201cThe Duke and Duchess are far more modern, far more intelligent, they don\u2019t think of nothing, like the other couple, but how many quarterings one has, their house is three hundred years in advance of their cousins\u2019,\u201d were customary remarks, the memory of which made me tremble as I looked at the card of invitation, to which they gave a far greater probability of its having been sent me by some practical joker\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If the Duke and Duchess had not been still at Cannes, I might have tried to find out from them whether the invitation which I had received was genuine. This state of doubt in which I was plunged was not due, as I flattered myself for a time by supposing, to a sentiment which a man of fashion would not have felt and which, consequently, a writer, even if he belonged apart from his writership to the fashionable caste, ought to reproduce in order to be thoroughly \u2018objective\u2019 and to depict each class differently. I happened, in fact, only the other day, in a charming volume of memoirs, to come upon the record of uncertainties analogous to those which the Princesse de Guermantes\u2019s card made me undergo. \u201cGeorges and I\u201d (or \u201cH\u00e9ly and I,\u201d I have not the book at hand to verify the reference) \u201cwere so keen to be asked to Mme. Delessert\u2019s that, having received an invitation from her, we thought it prudent, each of us independently, to make certain that we were not the victims of an April fool.\u201d Now, the writer is none other than the Comte d\u2019Haussonville (he who married the Duc de Broglie\u2019s daughter) and the other young man who \u2018independently\u2019 makes sure that he is not having a practical joke played on him is, according to whether he is called Georges or H\u00e9ly, one or other of the two inseparable friends of M. d\u2019Haussonville, either M. d\u2019Harcourt or the Prince de Chalais\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The day on which the party was to be given at the Princesse de Guermantes\u2019s, I learned that the Duke and Duchess had just returned to Paris. The Princess\u2019s ball would not have brought them back, but one of their cousins was seriously ill, and moreover the Duke was greatly taken up with a revel which was to be held the same night, and at which he himself was to appear as Louis XI and his wife as Isabel of Bavaria. And I determined to go and see her that morning. But, having gone out early, they had not yet returned; I watched first of all from a little room, which had seemed to me to be a good look-out post, for the arrival of their carriage. As a matter of fact I had made a singularly bad choice in my observatory from which I could barely make out our courtyard, but I did see into several others, and this, though of no value to me, occupied my mind for a time. It is not only in Venice that one has those outlooks on to several houses at once which have proved so tempting to painters; it is just the same in Paris. Nor do I cite Venice at random. It is of its poorer quarters that certain poor quarters of Paris make one think, in the morning, with their tall, wide chimneys to which the sun imparts the most vivid pinks, the brightest reds; it is a whole garden that flowers above the houses, and flowers in such a variety of tints that one would call it, planted on top of the town, the garden of a tulip-fancier of Delft or Haarlem. And then also, the extreme proximity of the houses, with their windows looking opposite one another on to a common courtyard, makes of each casement the frame in which a cook sits dreamily gazing down at the ground below, in which farther off a girl is having her hair combed by an old woman with the face, barely distinguishable in the shadow, of a witch: thus each courtyard provides for the adjoining house, by suppressing all sound in its interval, by leaving visible a series of silent gestures in a series of rectangular frames, glazed by the closing of the windows, an exhibition of a hundred Dutch paintings hung in rows. Certainly from the H\u00f4tel de Guermantes one did not have the same kind of view, but one had curious views also, especially from the strange trigonometrical point at which I had placed myself and from which one\u2019s gaze was arrested by nothing nearer than the distant heights formed by the comparatively vague plots of ground which preceded, on a steep slope, the mansion of the Marquise de Plassac and Mme. de Tresmes, cousins (of the most noble category) of M. de Guermantes, whom I did not know. Between me and this house (which was that of their father, M. de Br\u00e9quigny) nothing but blocks of buildings of low elevation, facing in every conceivable direction, which, without blocking the view, increased the distance with their diagonal perspective. The red-tiled turret of the coach-house in which the Marquis de Fr\u00e9court kept his carriages did indeed end in a spire that rose rather higher, but was so slender that it concealed nothing, and made one think of those picturesque old buildings in Switzerland which spring up in isolation at the foot of a mountain. All these vague and divergent points on which my eyes rested made more distant apparently than if it had been separated from us by several streets or by a series of foothills the house of Mme. de Plassac, actually quite near but chimerically remote as in an Alpine landscape. When its large paned windows, glittering in the sunlight like flakes of rock crystal, were thrown open so as to air the rooms, one felt, in following from one floor to the next the footmen whom it was impossible to see clearly but who were visibly shaking carpets, the same pleasure as when one sees in a landscape by Turner or Elstir a traveller in a mail-coach, or a guide, at different degrees of altitude on the Saint-Gothard. But from this point of view in which I had ensconced myself I should have been in danger of not seeing M. or Mme. de Guermantes come in, so that when in the afternoon I was free to resume my survey I simply stood on the staircase, from which the opening of the carriage-gate could not escape my notice, and it was on this staircase that I posted myself, albeit there did not appear there, so entrancing with their footmen rendered minute by distance and busily cleaning, the Alpine beauties of the Br\u00e9quigny-Tresmes mansion. Now this wait on the staircase was to have for me consequences so considerable, and to reveal to me a picture no longer Turneresque but ethical, of so great importance, that it is preferable to postpone the account of it for a little while by interposing first that of my visit to the Guermantes when I knew that they had come home. It was the Duke alone who received me in the library. As I went in there came out a little man with snow-white hair, a look of poverty, a little black neckcloth such as was worn by the lawyer at Combray and by several of my grandfather\u2019s friends, but of a more timid aspect than they, who, making me a series of profound bows, refused absolutely to go downstairs until I had passed him. The Duke shouted after him from the library something which I did not understand, and the other responded with further bows, addressed to the wall, for the Duke could not see him, but endlessly repeated nevertheless, like the purposeless smiles on the faces of people who are talking to one over the telephone; he had a falsetto voice, and saluted me afresh with the humility of a man of business. And he might, for that matter, have been a man of business from Combray, so much was he in the style, provincial, out of date and mild, of the small folk, the modest elders of those parts. \u201cYou shall see Oriane in a minute,\u201d the Duke told me when I had entered the room. \u201cAs Swann is coming in presently and bringing her the proofs of his book on the coinage of the Order of Malta, and, what is worse, an immense photograph he has had taken shewing both sides of each of the coins, Oriane preferred to get dressed early so that she can stay with him until it\u2019s time to go out to dinner. We have such a heap of things in the house already that we don\u2019t know where to put them all, and I ask myself where on earth we are going to stick this photograph. But I have too good-natured a wife, who is too fond of giving people pleasure. She thought it would be polite to ask Swann to let her see side by side on one sheet the heads of all those Grand Masters of the Order whose medals he has found at Rhodes. I said Malta, didn\u2019t I, it is Rhodes, but it\u2019s all the same Order of Saint John of Jerusalem. As a matter of fact, she is interested in them only because Swann makes a hobby of it. Our family is very much mixed up in the whole story; even at the present day, my brother, whom you know, is one of the highest dignitaries in the Order of Malta. But I might have told all that to Oriane, she simply wouldn\u2019t have listened to me. On the other hand, it was quite enough that Swann\u2019s researches into the Templars (it\u2019s astonishing the passion that people of one religion have for studying others) should have led him on to the history of the Knights of Rhodes, who succeeded the Templars, for Oriane at once to insist on seeing the heads of these Knights. They were very small fry indeed compared with the Lusignans, Kings of Cyprus, from whom we descend in a direct line. But so far, as Swann hasn\u2019t taken them up, Oriane doesn\u2019t care to hear anything about the Lusignans.\u201d I could not at once explain to the Duke why I had come. What happened was that several relatives or friends, including Mme. de Silistrie and the Duchesse de Montrose, came to pay a call on the Duchess, who was often at home before dinner, and not finding her there stayed for a short while with the Duke. The first of these ladies (the Princesse de Silistrie), simply attired, with a dry but friendly manner, carried a stick in her hand. I was afraid at first that she had injured herself, or was a cripple. She was on the contrary most alert. She spoke regretfully to the Duke of a first cousin of his own \u2014 not on the Guermantes side, but more illustrious still, were that possible \u2014 whose health, which had been in a grave condition for some time past, had grown suddenly worse. But it was evident that the Duke, while full of pity for his cousin\u2019s lot, and repeating \u201cPoor Mama! He\u2019s such a good fellow!\u201d had formed a favourable prognosis. The fact was that the dinner at which the Duke was to be present amused him, the big party at the Princesse de Guermantes\u2019s did not bore him, but above all he was to go on at one o\u2019clock in the morning with his wife to a great supper and costume ball, with a view to which a costume of Louis XI for himself, and one of Isabel of Bavaria for his wife were waiting in readiness. And the Duke was determined not to be disturbed amid all these gaieties by the sufferings of the worthy Amanien d\u2019Osmond. Two other ladies carrying sticks, Mme. de Plassac and Mme. de Tresmes, both daughters of the Comte de Br\u00e9quigny, came in next to pay Basin a visit, and declared that cousin Mama\u2019s state left no room now for hope. The Duke shrugged his shoulders, and to change the conversation asked whether they were going that evening to Marie-Gilbert\u2019s. They replied that they were not, in view of the state of Amanien who was in his last agony, and indeed they had excused themselves from the dinner to which the Duke was going, the other guests at which they proceeded to enumerate: the brother of King Theodosius, the Infanta Maria Concepcion, and so forth. As the Marquis d\u2019Osmond was less nearly related to them than he was to Basin, their \u2018defection\u2019 appeared to the Duke to be a sort of indirect reproach aimed at his own conduct. And so, albeit they had come down from the heights of the Br\u00e9quigny mansion to see the Duchess (or rather to announce to her the alarming character, incompatible for his relatives with attendance at social gatherings, of their cousin\u2019s illness) they did not stay long, and, each armed with her alpenstock, Walpurge and Doroth\u00e9e (such were the names of the two sisters) retraced the craggy path to their citadel. I never thought of asking the Guermantes what was the meaning of these sticks, so common in a certain part of the Faubourg Saint-Germain. Possibly, looking upon the whole parish as their domain, and not caring to hire cabs, they were in the habit of taking long walks, for which some old fracture, due to immoderate indulgence in the chase, and to the falls from horseback which are often the fruit of that indulgence, or simply rheumatism caused by the dampness of the left bank and of old country houses made a stick necessary. Perhaps they had not set out upon any such long expedition through the quarter, but, having merely come down into their garden (which lay at no distance from that of the Duchess) to pick the fruit required for stewing, had looked in on their way home to bid good evening to Mme. de Guermantes, though without going so far as to bring a pair of shears or a watering-can into her house. The Duke appeared touched that I should have come to see them so soon after their return to Paris. But his face grew dark when I told him that I had come to ask his wife to find out whether her cousin really had invited me. I had touched upon one of those services which M. and Mme. de Guermantes were not fond of rendering. The Duke explained to me that it was too late, that if the Princess had not sent me an invitation it would make him appear to be asking her for one, that his cousins had refused him one once before, and he had no wish to appear either directly or indirectly to be interfering with their visiting list, be \u2018meddling\u2019; finally, he could not even be sure that he and his wife, who were dining out that evening, would not come straight home afterwards, that in that case their best excuse for not having gone to the Princess\u2019s party would be to conceal from her the fact of their return to Paris, instead of hastening to inform her of it, as they must do if they sent her a note, or spoke to her over the telephone about me, and certainly too late to be of any use, since, in all probability, the Princess\u2019s list of guests would be closed by now. \u201cYou\u2019ve not fallen foul of her in any way?\u201d he asked in a suspicious tone, the Guermantes living in a constant fear of not being informed of the latest society quarrels, and so of people\u2019s trying to climb back into favour on their shoulders. Finally, as the Duke was in the habit of taking upon himself all decisions that might seem not very good-natured: \u201cListen, my boy,\u201d he said to me suddenly, as though the idea had just come into his head, \u201cI would really rather not mention at all to Oriane that you have been speaking to me about it. You know how kind-hearted she is; besides, she has an enormous regard for you, she would insist on sending to ask her cousin, in spite of anything I might say to the contrary, and if she is tired after dinner, there will be no getting out of it, she will be forced to go to the party. No, decidedly, I shall say nothing to her about it. Anyhow, you will see her yourself in a minute. But not a word about that matter, I beg of you. If you decide to go to the party, I have no need to tell you what a pleasure it will be to us to spend the evening there with you.\u201d The motives actuating humanity are too sacred for him before whom they are invoked not to bow to them, whether he believes them to be sincere or not; I did not wish to appear to be weighing in the balance for a moment the relative importance of my invitation and the possible tiredness of Mme. de Guermantes, and I promised not to speak to her of the object of my visit, exactly as though I had been taken in by the little farce which M. de Guermantes had performed for my benefit. I asked him if he thought there was any chance of my seeing Mme. de Stermaria at the Princess\u2019s. \u201cWhy, no,\u201d he replied with the air of an expert; \u201cI know the name you mention, from having seen it in lists of club members, it is not at all the type of person who goes to Gilbert\u2019s. You will see nobody there who is not excessively proper and intensely boring, duchesses bearing titles which one thought were extinct years ago and which they have revived for the occasion, all the Ambassadors, heaps of Coburgs, foreign royalties, but you mustn\u2019t hope for the ghost of a Stermaria. Gilbert would be taken ill at the mere thought of such a thing\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWait now, you\u2019re fond of painting, I must shew you a superb picture I bought from my cousin, partly in exchange for the Elstirs, which frankly did not appeal to us. It was sold to me as a Philippe de Champaigne, but I believe myself that it\u2019s by some one even greater. Would you like to know my idea? I believe it to be a Velazquez, and of the best period,\u201d said the Duke, looking me boldly in the eyes, whether to learn my impression or in the hope of enhancing it. A footman came in. \u201cMme. la Duchesse has told me to ask M. le Duc if M. le Duc will be so good as to see M. Swann, as Mme. la Duchesse is not quite ready.\u201d \u201cShew M. Swann in,\u201d said the Duke, after looking at his watch and seeing that he had still a few minutes before he need go to dress. \u201cNaturally my wife, who told him to come, is not ready. There\u2019s no use saying anything before Swann about Marie-Gilbert\u2019s party,\u201d said the Duke. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether he\u2019s been invited. Gilbert likes him immensely, because he believes him to be the natural grandson of the Duc de Berri, but that\u2019s a long story. (Otherwise, you can imagine! My cousin, who falls in a fit if he sees a Jew a mile off.) But now, don\u2019t you see, the Dreyfus case has made things more serious. Swann ought to have realised that he more than anyone must drop all connexion with those fellows, instead of which he says the most offensive things.\u201d The Duke called back the footman to know whether the man who had been sent to inquire at cousin Osmond\u2019s had returned. His plan was as follows: as he believed, and rightly, that his cousin was dying, he was anxious to obtain news of him before his death, that is to say before he was obliged to go into mourning. Once covered by the official certainty that Amanien was still alive, he could go without a thought to his dinner, to the Prince\u2019s party, to the midnight revel at which he would appear as Louis XI, and had made the most exciting assignation with a new mistress, and would make no more inquiries until the following day, when his pleasures would be at an end. Then one would put on mourning if the cousin had passed away in the night. \u201cNo, M. le Duc, he is not back yet.\u201d \u201cWhat in the Name of God! Nothing is ever done in this house till the last minute,\u201d cried the Duke, at the thought that Amanien might still be in time to \u2018croak\u2019 for an evening paper, and so make him miss his revel. He sent for the Temps, in which there was nothing. I had not seen Swann for a long time, and asked myself at first whether in the old days he used to clip his moustache, or had not his hair brushed up vertically in front, for I found in him something altered; it was simply that he was indeed greatly \u2018altered\u2019 because he was very ill, and illness produces in the face modifications as profound as are created by growing a beard or by changing the line of one\u2019s parting. (Swann\u2019s illness was the same that had killed his mother, who had been attacked by it at precisely the age which he had now reached. Our existences are in truth, owing to heredity, as full of cabalistic ciphers, of horoscopic castings as if there really were sorcerers in the world. And just as there is a certain duration of life for humanity in general, so there is one for families in particular, that is to say, in any one family, for the members of it who resemble one another.) Swann was dressed with an elegance which, like that of his wife, associated with what he now was what he once had been. Buttoned up in a pearl-grey frockcoat which emphasised the tallness of his figure, slender, his white gloves stitched in black, he carried a grey tall hat of a specially wide shape which Delion had ceased now to make except for him, the Prince de Sagan, the Marquis de Mod\u00e8ne, M. Charles Haas and Comte Louis de Turenne. I was surprised at the charming smile and affectionate handclasp with which he replied to my greeting, for I had imagined that after so long an interval he would not recognise me at once; I told him of my astonishment; he received it with a shout of laughter, a trace of indignation and a further grip of my hand, as if it were throwing doubt on the soundness of his brain or the sincerity of his affection to suppose that he did not know me. And yet that was what had happened; he did not identify me, as I learned long afterwards, until several minutes later when he heard my name mentioned. But no change in his face, in his .speech, in the things he said to me betrayed the discovery which a chance word from M. de Guermantes had enabled him to make, with such mastery, with such absolute sureness did he play the social game. He brought to it, moreover, that spontaneity in manners and personal initiative, even in his style of dress, which characterised the Guermantes type. Thus it was that the greeting which the old clubman, without recognising me, had given me was not the cold and stiff greeting of the man of the world who was a pure formalist, but a greeting full of a real friendliness, of a true charm, such as the Duchesse de Guermantes, for instance, possessed (carrying it so far as to smile at you first, before you had bowed to her, if she met you in the street), in contrast to the more mechanical greeting customary among the ladies of the Faubourg Saint-Germain. In the same way, again, the hat which, in conformity with a custom that was beginning to disappear, he laid on the floor by his feet, was lined with green leather, a thing not usually done, because, according to him, this kept the hat much cleaner, in reality because it was highly becoming. \u201cNow, Charles, you\u2019re a great expert, come and see what I\u2019ve got to shew you, after which, my boys, I\u2019m going to ask your permission to leave you together for a moment while I go and change my clothes, besides, I expect Oriane won\u2019t be long now.\u201d And he shewed his \u2018Velazquez\u2019 to Swann. \u201cBut it seems to me that I know this,\u201d said Swann with the grimace of a sick man for whom the mere act of speaking requires an effort. \u201cYes,\u201d said the Duke, turned serious by the time which the expert took in expressing his admiration. \u201cYou have probably seen it at Gilbert\u2019s.\u201d \u201cOh, yes, of course, I remember.\u201d \u201cWhat do you suppose it is?\u201d \u201cOh, well, if it cornes from Gilbert\u2019s, it is probably one of your ancestors,\u201d said Swann with a blend of irony and deference towards a form of greatness which he would have felt it impolite and absurd to despise, but to which for reasons of good taste he preferred to make only a playful reference\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cTo be sure, it is,\u201d said the Duke bluntly. \u201cIt\u2019s Boson, the I forget how manieth de Guermantes. Not that I care a damn about that. You know I\u2019m not as feudal as my cousin. I\u2019ve heard the names mentioned of Rigaud, Mignard, Velazquez even!\u201d he went on, fastening on Swann the gaze of an inquisitor and executioner in an attempt at once to read into his mind and to influence his response. \u201cWell,\u201d he concluded, for when he was led to provoke artificially an opinion which he desired to hear, he had the faculty, after a few moments, of believing that it had been spontaneously uttered; \u201ccome, now, none of your flattery, do you think it\u2019s by one of those big masters I\u2019ve mentioned?\u201d \u201cNnnnno,\u201d said Swann. \u201cBut after all, I know nothing about these things, it\u2019s not for me to decide who daubed the canvas. But you\u2019re a dilettante, a master of the subject, to whom do you attribute it? You\u2019re enough of an expert to have some idea. What would you put it down as?\u201d Swann hesitated for a moment before the picture, which obviously he thought atrocious. \u201cA bad joke!\u201d he replied with a smile at the Duke who could not check an impulsive movement of rage. When this had subsided: \u201cBe good fellows, both of you, wait a moment for Oriane, I must go and put on my swallow-tails and then I\u2019ll join you. I shall send word to my good woman that you\u2019re both waiting for her.\u201d I talked for a minute or two with Swann about the Dreyfus case, and asked him how it was that all the Guermantes were anti-Dreyfusards. \u201cIn the first place because at heart all these people are anti-Semites,\u201d replied Swann, who, all the same, knew very well from experience that certain of them were not, but, like everyone who supports any cause with ardour, preferred, to explain the fact that other people did not share his opinion, to suppose in them a preconceived reason, a prejudice against which there was nothing to be done, rather than reasons which might permit of discussion. Besides, having come to the premature term of his life, like a weary animal that is goaded on, he cried out against these persecutions and was returning to the spiritual fold of his fathers. \u201cYes, the Prince de Guermantes,\u201d I said, \u201cit is true, I\u2019ve heard that he was anti-semitic.\u201d \u201cOh, that fellow! I wasn\u2019t even thinking about him. He carries it to such a point that when he was in the army and had a frightful toothache he preferred to grin and bear it rather than go to the only dentist in the district, who happened to be a Jew, and later on he allowed a wing of his castle which had caught fire to be burned to the ground, because he would have had to send for extinguishers to the place next door, which belongs to the Rothschilds.\u201d \u201cAre you going to be there this evening, by any chance?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d Swann replied, \u201calthough I am far too tired. But he sent me a wire to tell me that he has something to say to me. I feel that I shall be too unwell in the next few days to go there or to see him at home; it would upset me, so I prefer to get it over at once.\u201d \u201cBut the Duc de Guermantes is not anti-semitic?\u201d \u201cYou can see quite well that he is, since he\u2019s an anti-Dreyfusard,\u201d replied Swann, without noticing the logical fallacy. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t prevent my being very sorry that I disappointed the man \u2014 what am I saying? The Duke, I mean \u2014 by not admiring his Mignard or whatever he calls it.\u201d \u201cBut at any rate,\u201d I went on, reverting to the Dreyfus case, \u201cthe Duchess, she, now, is intelligent.\u201d \u201cYes, she is charming. To my mind, however, she was even more charming when she was still known as the Princesse des Laumes. Her mind has become somehow more angular, it was all much softer in the juvenile great lady, but after all, young or old, men or women, what can you expect, all these people belong to a different race, one can\u2019t have a thousand years of feudalism in one\u2019s blood with impunity. Naturally they imagine that it counts for nothing in their opinions.\u201d \u201cAll the same, Robert de Saint-Loup is a Dreyfusard.\u201d \u201cAh! So much the better, all the more as you know that his mother is extremely \u2018and.\u2019 I had heard that he was, but I wasn\u2019t certain of it. That gives me a great deal of pleasure. It doesn\u2019t surprise me, he\u2019s highly intelligent. It\u2019s a great thing, that is.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dreyfusism had brought to Swann an extraordinary simplicity of mind and had imparted to his way of looking at things an impulsiveness, an inconsistency more noticeable even than had been the similar effects of his marriage to Odette; this new loss of caste would have been better described as a recasting, and was entirely to his credit, since it made him return to the ways in which his forebears had trodden and from which he had turned aside to mix with the aristocracy. But Swann, just at the very moment when with such lucidity it had been granted to him, thanks to the gifts he had inherited from his race, to perceive a truth that was still hidden from people of fashion, shewed himself nevertheless quite comically blind. He subjected afresh all his admirations and all his contempts to the test of a new criterion, Dreyfusism. That the anti-Dreyfusism of Mme. Bontemps should have made him think her a fool was no more astonishing than that, when he was first married, he should have thought her intelligent. It was not very serious either that the new wave reached also his political judgments and made him lose all memory of having treated as a man with a price, a British spy (this latter was an absurdity of the Guermantes set), Clemenceau, whom he declared now to have always stood up for conscience, to be a man of iron, like Comely. \u201cNo, no, I never told you anything of the sort. You\u2019re thinking of some one else.\u201d But, sweeping past his political judgments, the wave overthrew in Swann his literary judgments also, and even affected his way of pronouncing them. Barr\u00e9s had lost all his talent, and even the books of his early days were feeble, one could hardly read them again. \u201cYou try, you\u2019ll find you can\u2019t struggle to the end. What a difference from Clemenceau! Personally, I am not anticlerical, but when you compare them together you must see that Barr\u00e9s is invertebrate. He\u2019s a very great fellow, is old Clemenceau. How he knows the language!\u201d However, the anti-Dreyfusards were in no position to criticise these follies. They explained that one was a Dreyfusard by one\u2019s being of Jewish origin. If a practising Catholic like Saniette stood out also for a fresh trial, that was because he was buttonholed by Mme. Verdurin, who behaved like a wild Radical. She was out above all things against the \u2018frocks.\u2019 Saniette was more fool than knave, and had no idea of the harm that the Mistress was doing him. If you pointed out that Brichot was equally a friend of Mme. Verdurin and was a member of the Patrie Fran\u00e7aise, that was because he was more intelligent. \u201cYou see him occasionally?\u201d I asked Swann, referring to Saint-Loup. \u201cNo, never. He wrote to me the other day hoping that I would ask the Duc de Mouchy and various other people to vote for him at the Jockey, where for that matter he got through like a letter through the post.\u201d \u201cIn spite of the Case!\u201d \u201cThe question was never raised. However I must tell you that since all this business began I never set foot in the place.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0M. de Guermantes returned, and was presently joined by his wife, all ready now for the evening, tall and proud in a gown of red satin the skirt of which was bordered with spangles. She had in her hair a long ostrich feather dyed purple, and over her shoulders a tulle scarf of the same red as her dress. \u201cHow nice it is to have one\u2019s hat lined with leather,\u201d said the Duchess, whom nothing escaped. \u201cHowever, with you, Charles, everything is always charming, whether it\u2019s what you wear or what you say what you read or what you do.\u201d Swann meanwhile, without apparently listening, was considering the Duchess as he would have studied the canvas of a master, and then sought her gaze, making with his lips the grimace which implies: \u2018The devil!\u2019 Mme. de Guermantes rippled with laughter. \u201cSo my clothes please you? I\u2019m delighted. But I must say that they don\u2019t please me much,\u201d she went on with a sulking air. \u201cGood Lord, what a bore it is to have to dress up and go out when one would ever so much rather stay at home!\u201d \u201cWhat magnificent rubies!\u201d \u201cAh! my dear Charles, at least one can see that you know what you\u2019re talking about, you\u2019re not like that brute Monserfeuil who asked me if they were real. I must say that I\u2019ve never seen anything quite like them. They were a present from the Grand Duchess. They\u2019re a little too large for my liking, a little too like claret glasses filled to the brim, but I\u2019ve put them on because we shall be seeing the Grand Duchess this evening at Marie-Gilbert\u2019s,\u201d added Mme. de Guermantes, never suspecting that this assertion destroyed the force of those previously made by the Duke. \u201cWhat\u2019s on at the Princess\u2019s?\u201d inquired Swann. \u201cPractically nothing,\u201d the Duke hastened to reply, the question having made him think that Swann was not invited. \u201cWhat\u2019s that, Basin? When all the highways and hedgerows have been scoured? It will be a deathly crush. What will be pretty, though,\u201d she went on, looking wistfully at Swann, \u201cif the storm I can feel in the air now doesn\u2019t break, will be those marvellous gardens. You know them, of course. I was there a month ago, at the time when the lilacs were in flower, you can\u2019t have any idea how lovely they were. And then the fountain, really, it\u2019s Versailles in Paris.\u201d \u201cWhat sort of person is the Princess?\u201d I asked. \u201cWhy, you know quite well, you\u2019ve seen her here, she\u2019s as beautiful as the day, also rather an idiot. Very nice, in spite of all her Germanic high-and-mightiness, full of good nature and stupid mistakes.\u201d Swann was too subtle not to perceive that the Duchess, in this speech, was trying to shew the \u2018Guermantes wit,\u2019 and at no great cost to herself, for she was only serving up in a less perfect form an old saying of her own. Nevertheless, to prove to the Duchess that he appreciated her intention to be, and as though she had really succeeded in being, funny, he smiled with a slightly forced air, causing me by this particular form of insincerity the same feeling of awkwardness that used to disturb me long ago when I heard my parents discussing with M. Vinteuil the corruption of certain sections of society (when they knew very well that a corruption far greater sat enthroned at Montjouvain), Legrandin colouring his utterances for the benefit of fools, choosing delicate epithets which he knew perfectly well would not be understood by a rich or smart but illiterate public. \u201cCome now, Oriane, what on earth are you saying?\u201d broke in M. de Guermantes. \u201cMarie a fool? Why, she has read everything, she\u2019s as musical as a fiddle.\u201d \u201cBut, my poor little Basin, you\u2019re as innocent as a new-born babe. As if one could not be all that, and rather an idiot as well. Idiot is too strong a word; no, she\u2019s in the clouds, she\u2019s Hesse-Darmstadt, Holy Roman Empire, and! wa-wa-wa. Her pronunciation alone makes me tired. But I quite admit that she\u2019s a charming loony. Simply the idea of stepping down from her German throne to go and marry, in the most middle-class way, a private citizen. It is true that she chose him! Yes, it\u2019s quite true,\u201d she went on, turning to me, \u201cyou don\u2019t know Gilbert. Let me give you an idea of him, he took to his bed once because I had left a card on Mme. Carnot. But, my little Charles,\u201d said the Duchess, changing the conversation when she saw that the story of the card left on the Carnots appeared to irritate M. de Guermantes, \u201cyou know, you\u2019ve never sent me that photograph of our Knights of Rhodes, whom I\u2019ve learned to love through you, and I am so anxious to make their acquaintance.\u201d The Duke meanwhile had not taken his eyes from his wife\u2019s face. \u201cOriane, you might at least tell the story properly and not cut out half. I ought to explain,\u201d he corrected, addressing Swann, \u201cthat the British Ambassadress at that time, who was a very worthy woman, but lived rather in the moon and was in the habit of making up these odd combinations, conceived the distinctly quaint idea of inviting us with the President and his wife. We were \u2014 Oriane herself was rather surprised, especially as the Ambassadress knew quite enough of the people we knew not to invite us, of all things, to so ill-assorted a gathering. There was a Minister there who is a swindler, however I pass over all that, we had not been warned in time, were caught in the trap, and, I\u2019m bound to admit, all these people behaved most civilly to us. Only, once was enough. Mme. de Guermantes, who does not often do me the honour of consulting me, felt it incumbent upon her to leave a card in the course of the following week at the Elys\u00e9e. Gilbert may perhaps have gone rather far in regarding it as a stain upon our name. But it must not be forgotten that, politics apart, M. Carnot, who for that matter filled his post quite adequately, was the grandson of a member of the Revolutionary Tribunal which caused the death of eleven of our people in a single day.\u201d \u201cIn that case, Basin, why did you go every week to dine at Chantilly? The Due d\u2019Aumale was just as much the grandson of a member of the Revolutionary Tribunal, with this difference, that Carnot was a brave man and Philippe Egalit\u00e9 a wretched scoundrel.\u201d \u201cExcuse my interrupting you to explain that I did send the photograph,\u201d said Swann. \u201cI can\u2019t understand how it hasn\u2019t reached you.\u201d \u201cIt doesn\u2019t altogether surprise me,\u201d said the Duchess, \u201cmy servants tell me only what they think fit. They probably do not approve of the Order of Saint John.\u201d And she rang the bell. \u201cYou, know, Oriane, that when I used to go to Chantilly it was without enthusiasm.\u201d \u201cWithout enthusiasm, but with a nightshirt in a bag, in case the Prince asked you to stay, which for that matter he very rarely did, being a perfect cad like all the Orl\u00e9ans lot. Do you know who else are to be dining at Mme. de Saint-Euverte\u2019s?\u201d Mme. de Guermantes asked her husband. \u201cBesides the people you know already, she\u2019s asked at the last moment King Theodosius\u2019s brother.\u201d At these tidings the Duchess\u2019s features breathed contentment and her speech boredom. \u201cOh, good heavens, more princes!\u201d \u201cBut that one is well-mannered and intelligent,\u201d Swann suggested. \u201cNot altogether, though,\u201d replied the Duchess, apparently seeking for words that would give more novelty to the thought expressed. \u201cHave you ever noticed with princes that the best-mannered among them are not really well-mannered? They must always have an opinion about everything. Then, as they have none of their own, they spend the first half of their lives asking us ours and the other half serving it up to us secondhand. They positively must be able to say that one piece has been well played and the next not so well. When there is no difference. Listen, this little Theodosius junior (I forget his name) asked me what one called an orchestral motif. I replied,\u201d said the Duchess, her eyes sparkling while a laugh broke from her beautiful red lips: \u201c\u2018One calls it an orchestral motif.\u2019 I don\u2019t think he was any too well pleased, really. Oh, my dear Charles,\u201d she went on, \u201cwhat a bore it can be, dining out. There are evenings when one would sooner die! It is true that dying may be perhaps just as great a bore, because we don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like.\u201d A servant appeared. It was the young lover who used to have trouble with the porter, until the Duchess, in her kindness of heart, brought about an apparent peace between them. \u201cAm I to go up this evening to inquire for M. le Marquis d\u2019Osmond?\u201d he asked. \u201cMost certainly not, nothing before to-morrow morning. In fact I don\u2019t want you to remain in the house to-night. The only thing that will happen will be that his footman, who knows you, will come to you with the latest report and send you out after us. Get off, go anywhere you like, have a woman, sleep out, but I don\u2019t want to see you here before to-morrow morning.\u201d An immense joy overflowed from the footman\u2019s face. He would at last be able to spend long hours with his ladylove, whom he had practically ceased to see ever since, after a final scene with the porter, the Duchess had considerately explained to him that it would be better, to avoid further conflicts, if he did not go out at all. He floated, at the thought of having an evening free at last, in a happiness which the Duchess saw and guessed its reason. She felt, so to speak, a tightening of the heart and an itching in all her limbs at the sight of this happiness which an amorous couple were snatching behind her back, concealing themselves from her, which left her irritated and jealous. \u201cNo, Basin, let him stay here; I say, he\u2019s not to stir out of the house.\u201d \u201cBut, Oriane, that\u2019s absurd, the house is crammed with servants, and you have the costumier\u2019s people coming as well at twelve to dress us for this show. There\u2019s absolutely nothing for him to do, and he\u2019s the only one who\u2019s a friend of Mama\u2019s footman; I would a thousand times rather get him right away from the house.\u201d \u201cListen, Basin, let me do what I want, I shall have a message for him to take in the evening, as it happens, I can\u2019t tell yet at what time. In any case you\u2019re not to go out of the house for a single instant, do you hear?\u201d she said to the despairing footman. If there were continual quarrels, and if servants did not stay long with the Duchess, the person to whose charge this guerrilla warfare was to be laid was indeed irremovable, but it was not the porter; no doubt for the rougher tasks, for the martyrdoms that it was more tiring to inflict, for the quarrels which ended in blows, the Duchess entrusted the heavier instruments to him; but even then he played his part without the least suspicion that he had been cast for it. Like the household servants, he admired the Duchess for her kindness of heart; and footmen of little discernment who came back, after leaving her service, to visit Fran\u00e7oise used to say that the Duke\u2019s house would have been the finest \u2018place\u2019 in Paris if it had not been for the porter\u2019s lodge. The Duchess \u2018played\u2019 the lodge on them, just as at different times clericalism, freemasonry, the Jewish peril have been played on the public. Another footman came into the room. \u201cWhy have not they brought up the package that M. Swann sent here? And, by the way (you\u2019ve heard, Charles, that Mama is seriously ill?), Jules went up to inquire for news of M. le Marquis d\u2019Osmond: has he come back yet?\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s just come this instant, M. le Duc. They\u2019re waiting from one moment to the next for M. le Marquis to pass away.\u201d \u201cAh! He\u2019s alive!\u201d exclaimed the Duke with a sigh of relief. \u201cThat\u2019s all right, that\u2019s all right: sold again, Satan! While there\u2019s life there\u2019s hope,\u201d the Duke announced to us with a joyful air. \u201cThey\u2019ve been talking about him as though he were dead and buried. In a week from now he\u2019ll be fitter than I am.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the Doctors who said that he wouldn\u2019t last out the evening. One of them wanted to call again during the night. The head one said it was no use. M. le Marquis would be dead by then; they\u2019ve only kept him alive by injecting him with camphorated oil.\u201d \u201cHold your tongue, you damned fool,\u201d cried the Duke in a paroxysm of rage. \u201cWho the devil asked you to say all that? You haven\u2019t understood a word of what they told you.\u201d \u201cIt wasn\u2019t me they told, it was Jules.\u201d \u201cWill you hold your tongue!\u201d roared the Duke, and, turning to Swann, \u201cWhat a blessing he\u2019s still alive! He will regain his strength gradually, don\u2019t you know. Still alive, after being in such a critical state, that in itself is an excellent sign. One mustn\u2019t expect everything at once. It can\u2019t be at all unpleasant, a little injection of camphorated oil.\u201d He rubbed his hands. \u201cHe\u2019s alive; what more could anyone want? After going through all that he\u2019s gone through, it\u2019s a great step forward. Upon my word, I envy him having such a temperament. Ah! these invalids, you know, people do all sorts of little things for them that they don\u2019t do for us. Now to-day there was a devil of a cook who sent me up a leg of mutton with b\u00e9arnaise sauce \u2014 it was done to a turn, I must admit, but just for that very reason I took so much of it that it\u2019s still lying on my stomach. However, that doesn\u2019t make people come to inquire for me as they do for dear Amanien. We do too much inquiring. It only tires him. We must let him have room to breathe. They\u2019re killing the poor fellow by sending round to him all the time.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d said the Duchess to the footman as he was leaving the room, \u201cI gave orders for the envelope containing a photograph which M. Swann sent me to be brought up here.\u201d \u201cMadame la Duchesse, it is so large that I didn\u2019t know if I could get it through the door. We have left it in the hall. Does Madame la Duchesse wish me to bring it up?\u201d \u201cOh, in that case, no; they ought to have told me, but if it\u2019s so big I shall see it in a moment when I come downstairs.\u201d \u201cI forgot to tell Mme. la Duchesse that Mme. la Comtesse Mole left a card this morning for Mme. la Duchesse.\u201d \u201cWhat, this morning?\u201d said the Duchess with an air of disapproval, feeling that so young a woman ought not to take the liberty of leaving cards in the morning. \u201cAbout ten o\u2019clock, Madame la Duchesse.\u201d \u201cShew me the cards.\u201d \u201cIn any case, Oriane, when you say that it was a funny idea on Marie\u2019s part to marry Gilbert,\u201d went on the Duke, reverting to the original topic of conversation, \u201cit is you who have an odd way of writing history. If either of them was a fool, it was Gilbert, for having married of all people a woman so closely related to the King of the Belgians, who has usurped the name of Brabant which belongs to us. To put it briefly, we are of the same blood as the Hesses, and of the elder branch. It is always stupid to talk about oneself,\u201d he apologised to me, \u201cbut after all, whenever we have been not only at Darmstadt, but even at Cassel and all over Electoral Hesse, the Landgraves have always, all of them, been most courteous in giving us precedence as being of the elder branch.\u201d \u201cBut really, Basin, you don\u2019t mean to tell me that a person who was a Major in every regiment in her country, who had been engaged to the King of Sweden . . . \u201d \u201cOriane, that is too much; anyone would think that you didn\u2019t know that the King of Sweden\u2019s grandfather was tilling the soil at Pau when we had been ruling the roost for nine hundred years throughout the whole of Europe.\u201d \u201cThat doesn\u2019t alter the fact that if somebody were to say in the street: \u2018Hallo, there\u2019s the King of Sweden,\u2019 everyone would at once rush to see him as far as the Place de la Concorde, and if he said: \u2018There\u2019s M. de Guermantes,\u2019 nobody would know who M. de Guermantes was.\u201d \u201cWhat an argument!\u201d \u201cBesides, I never can understand how, once the title of Duke of Brabant has passed to the Belgian Royal Family, you can continue to claim it.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The footman returned with the Comtesse Mole\u2019s card, or rather what she had left in place of a card. Alleging that she had none on her, she had taken from her pocket a letter addressed to herself, and keeping the contents had handed in the envelope which bore the inscription: \u2018La Comtesse Mole.\u2019 As the envelope was rather large, following the fashion in notepaper which prevailed that year, this manuscript \u2018card\u2019 was almost twice the size of an ordinary visiting card. \u201cThat is what people call Mme. Mole\u2019s \u2018simplicity,\u2019\u201d said the Duchess ironically. \u201cShe wants to make us think that she had no cards on her, and to shew her originality. But we know all about that, don\u2019t we, my little Charles, we are quite old enough and quite original enough ourselves to see through the tricks of a little lady who has only been going about for four years. She is charming, but she doesn\u2019t seem to me, all the same, to be quite \u2018big\u2019 enough to imagine that she can take the world by surprise with so little effort as merely leaving an envelope instead of a card and leaving it at ten o\u2019clock in the morning. Her old mother mouse will shew her that she knows a thing or two about that.\u201d Swann could not help smiling at the thought that the Duchess, who was, incidentally, a trifle jealous of Mme. Mole\u2019s success, would find it quite in accordance with the \u2018Guermantes wit\u2019 to make some impertinent retort to her visitor. \u201cSo far as the title of Duc de Brabant is concerned, I\u2019ve told you a hundred times, Oriane . . . \u201d the Duke continued, but the Duchess, without listening, cut him short. \u201cBut, my little Charles, I\u2019m longing to see your photograph.\u201d \u201cAh! Extinctor draconis latrator Anubis,\u201d said Swann. \u201cYes, it was so charming what you said about that when you were comparing the Saint George at Venice. But I don\u2019t understand: why Anubis?\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s the one like who was an ancestor of Babal?\u201d asked M. de Guermantes. \u201cYou want to see his bauble?\u201d retorted his wife, dryly, to shew she herself scorned the pun. \u201cI want to see them all,\u201d she added. \u201cListen, Charles, let us wait downstairs till the carriage comes,\u201d said the Duke; \u201cyou can pay your call on us in the hall, because my wife won\u2019t let us have any peace until she\u2019s seen your photograph. I am less impatient, I must say,\u201d he added with a satisfied air. \u201cI am not easily moved myself, but she would see us all dead rather than miss it.\u201d \u201cI am entirely of your opinion, Basin,\u201d said the Duchess, \u201clet us go into the hall; we shall at least know why we have come down from your study, while we shall never know how we have come down from the Counts of Brabant.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve told you a hundred times how the title came into the House of Hesse,\u201d said the Duke (while we were going downstairs to look at the photograph, and I thought of those that Swann used to bring me at Combray), \u201cthrough the marriage of a Brabant in 1241 with the daughter of the last Landgrave of Thuringia and Hesse, so that really it is the title of Prince of Hesse that came to the House of Brabant rather than that of Duke of Brabant to the House of Hesse. You will remember that our battle-cry was that of the Dukes of Brabant: \u2018Limbourg to her conqueror!\u2019 until we exchanged the arms of Brabant for those of Guermantes, in which I think myself that we were wrong, and the example of the Gramonts will not make me change my opinion.\u201d \u201cBut,\u201d replied Mme. de Guermantes, \u201cas it is the King of the Belgians who is the conqueror . . . Besides the Belgian Crown Prince calls himself Duc de Brabant.\u201d \u201cBut, my dear child, your argument will not hold water for a moment. You know as well as I do that there are titles of pretension which can perfectly well exist even if the territory is occupied by usurpers. For instance, the King of Spain describes himself equally as Duke of Brabant, claiming in virtue of a possession less ancient than ours, but more ancient than that of the King of the Belgians. He calls himself also Duke of Burgundy, King of the Indies Occidental and Oriental, and Duke of Milan. Well, he is no more in possession of Burgundy, the Indies or Brabant than I possess Brabant myself, or the Prince of Hesse either, for that matter. The King of Spain likewise proclaims himself King of Jerusalem, as does the Austrian Emperor, and Jerusalem belongs to neither one nor the other.\u201d He stopped for a moment with an awkward feeling that the mention of Jerusalem might have embarrassed Swann, in view of \u2018current events,\u2019 but only went on more rapidly: \u201cWhat you said just now might be said of anyone. We were at one time Dukes of Aumale, a duchy that has passed as regularly to the House of France as Joinville and Chevreuse have to the House of Albert. We make no more claim to those titles than to that of Marquis de Noirmoutiers, which was at one time ours, and became perfectly regularly the appanage of the House of La Tr\u00e9mo\u00eflle, but because certain cessions are valid, it does not follow that they all are. For instance,\u201d he went on, turning to me, \u201cmy sister-in-law\u2019s son bears the title of Prince d\u2019Agrigente, which comes to us from Joan the Mad, as that of Prince de Tarente comes to the La Tr\u00e9mo\u00eflles. Well, Napoleon went and gave this title of Tarente to a soldier, who may have been admirable in the ranks, but in doing so the Emperor was disposing of what belonged to him even less than Napoleon III when he created a Duc de Montmorency, since P\u00e9rigord had at least a mother who was a Montmorency, while the Tarente of Napoleon I had no more Tarente about him than Napoleon\u2019s wish that he should become so. That did not prevent Chaix d\u2019Est-Ange, alluding to our uncle Cond\u00e9, from asking the Procurer Imp\u00e9rial if he had picked up the title of Duc de Montmorency in the moat of Vincennes.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cListen, Basin, I ask for nothing better than to follow you to the ditches of Vincennes, or even to Tarante. And that reminds me, Charles, of what I was going to say to you when you were telling me about your Saint George at Venice. We have an idea, Basin and I, of spending next spring in Italy and Sicily. If you were to come with us, just think what a difference it would make! I\u2019m not thinking only of the pleasure of seeing you, but imagine, after all you\u2019ve told me so often about the remains of the Norman Conquest and of ancient history, imagine what a trip like that would become if you came with us! I mean to say that even Basin \u2014 what am I saying, Gilbert \u2014 would benefit by it, because I feel that even his claims to the throne of Naples and all that sort of thing would interest me if they were explained by you in old romanesque churches in little villages perched on hills like primitive paintings. But now we\u2019re going to look at your photograph. Open the envelope,\u201d said the Duchess to a footman. \u201cPlease, Oriane, not this evening; you can look at it to-morrow,\u201d implored the Duke, who had already been making signs of alarm to me on seeing the huge size of the photograph. \u201cBut I like to look at it with Charles,\u201d said the Duchess, with a smile at once artificially concupiscent and psychologically subtle, for in her desire to be friendly to Swann she spoke of the pleasure which she would have in looking at the photograph as though it were the pleasure an invalid feels he would find in eating an orange, or as though she had managed to combine an escapade with her friends with giving information to a biographer as to some of her favourite pursuits. \u201cAll right, he will come again to see you, on purpose,\u201d declared the Duke, to whom his wife was obliged to yield. \u201cYou can spend three hours in front of it, if that amuses you,\u201d he added ironically. \u201cBut where are you going to stick a toy of those dimensions?\u201d \u201cWhy, in my room, of course. I like to have it before my eyes.\u201d \u201cOh, just as you please; if it\u2019s in your room, probably I shall never see it,\u201d said the Duke, without thinking of the revelation he was thus blindly making of the negative character of his conjugal relations. \u201cVery well, you will undo it with the greatest care,\u201d Mme. de Guermantes told the servant, multiplying her instructions out of politeness to Swann. \u201cAnd see that you don\u2019t crumple the envelope, either.\u201d \u201cSo even the envelope has got to be respected!\u201d the Duke murmured to me, raising his eyes to the ceiling. \u201cBut, Swann,\u201d he added, \u201cI, who am only a poor married man and thoroughly prosaic, what I wonder at is how on earth you managed to find an envelope that size. Where did you pick it up?\u201d \u201cOh, at the photographer\u2019s; they\u2019re always sending out things like that. But the man is a fool, for I see he\u2019s written on it \u2018The Duchesse de Guermantes,\u2019 without putting \u2018Madame.\u2019\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll forgive him for that,\u201d said the Duchess carelessly; then, seeming to be struck by a sudden idea which enlivened her, checked a faint smile; but at once returning to Swann: \u201cWell, you don\u2019t say whether you\u2019re coming to Italy with us?\u201d \u201cMadame, I am really afraid that it will not be possible.\u201d \u201cIndeed! Mme. de Montmorency is more fortunate. You went with her to Venice and Vicenza. She told me that with you one saw things one would never see otherwise, things no one had ever thought of mentioning before, that you shewed her things she had never dreamed of, and that even in the well-known things she had been able to appreciate details which without you she might have passed by a dozen times without ever noticing. Obviously, she has been more highly favoured than we are to be. . . . You will take the big envelope from M. Swann\u2019s photograph,\u201d she said to the servant, \u201cand you will hand it in, from me, this evening at half past ten at Mme. la Comtesse Mole\u2019s.\u201d Swann laughed. \u201cI should like to know, all the same,\u201d Mme. de Guermantes asked him, \u201chow, ten months before the time, you can tell that a thing will be impossible.\u201d \u201cMy dear Duchess, I will tell you if you insist upon it, but, first of all, you can see that I am very ill.\u201d \u201cYes, my little Charles, I don\u2019t think you look at all well. I\u2019m not pleased with your colour, but I\u2019m not asking you to come with me next week, I ask you to come in ten months. In ten months one has time to get oneself cured, you know.\u201d At this point a footman came in to say that the carriage was at the door. \u201cCome, Oriane, to horse,\u201d said the Duke, already pawing the ground with impatience as though he were himself one of the horses that stood waiting outside. \u201cVery well, give me in one word the reason why you can\u2019t come to Italy,\u201d the Duchess put it to Swann as she rose to say good-bye to us. \u201cBut, my dear friend, it\u2019s because I shall then have been dead for several months. According to the doctors I consulted last winter, the thing I\u2019ve got \u2014 which may, for that matter, carry me off at any moment \u2014 won\u2019t in any case leave me more than three or four months to live, and even that is a generous estimate,\u201d replied Swann with a smile, while the footman opened the glazed door of the hall to let the Duchess out. \u201cWhat\u2019s that you say?\u201d cried the Duchess, stopping for a moment on her way to the carriage, and raising her fine eyes, their melancholy blue clouded by uncertainty. Placed for the first time in her life between two duties as incompatible as getting into her carriage to go out to dinner and shewing pity for a man who was about to die, she could find nothing in the code of conventions that indicated the right line to follow, and, not knowing which to choose, felt it better to make a show of not believing that the latter alternative need be seriously considered, so as to follow the first, which demanded of her at the moment less effort, and thought that the best way of settling the conflict would be to deny that any existed. \u201cYou\u2019re joking,\u201d she said to Swann. \u201cIt would be a joke in charming taste,\u201d replied he ironically. \u201cI don\u2019t know why I am telling you this; I have never said a word to you before about my illness. But as you asked me, and as now I may die at any moment . . . But whatever I do I mustn\u2019t make you late; you\u2019re dining out, remember,\u201d he added, because he knew that for other people their own social obligations took precedence of the death of a friend, and could put himself in her place by dint of his instinctive politeness. But that of the Duchess enabled her also to perceive in a vague way that the dinner to which she was going must count for less to Swann than his own death. And so, while continuing on her way towards the carriage, she let her shoulders droop, saying: \u201cDon\u2019t worry about our dinner. It\u2019s not of any importance!\u201d But this put the Duke in a bad humour, who exclaimed: \u201cCome, Oriane, don\u2019t stop there chattering like that and exchanging your jeremiads with Swann; you know very well that Mme. de Saint-Euverte insists on sitting down to table at eight o\u2019clock sharp. We must know what you propose to do; the horses have been waiting for a good five minutes. I beg your pardon, Charles,\u201d he went on, turning to Swann, \u201cbut it\u2019s ten minutes to eight already. Oriane is always late, and it will take us more than five minutes to get to old Saint-Euverte\u2019s.\u201d Mme. de Guermantes advanced resolutely towards the carriage and uttered a last farewell to Swann. \u201cYou know, we can talk about that another time; I don\u2019t believe a word you\u2019ve been saying, but we must discuss it quietly. I expect they gave you a dreadful fright, come to luncheon, whatever day you like\u201d (with Mme. de Guermantes things always resolved themselves into luncheons), \u201cyou will let me know your day and time,\u201d and, lifting her red skirt, she set her foot on the step. She was just getting into the carriage when, seeing this foot exposed, the Duke cried in a terrifying voice: \u201cOriane, what have you been thinking of, you wretch? You\u2019ve kept on your black shoes! With a red dress! Go upstairs quick and put on red shoes, or rather,\u201d he said to the footman, \u201ctell the lady\u2019s maid at once to bring down a pair of red shoes.\u201d \u201cBut, my dear,\u201d replied the Duchess gently, annoyed to see that Swann, who was leaving the house with me but had stood back to allow the carriage to pass out in front of us, could hear, \u201csince we are late.\u201d \u201cNo, no, we have plenty of time. It is only ten to; it won\u2019t take us ten minutes to get to the Parc Monceau. And, after all, what would it matter? If we turned up at half past eight they\u2019d have to wait for us, but you can\u2019t possibly go there in a red dress and black shoes. Besides, we shan\u2019t be the last, I can tell you; the Sassenages are coming, and you know they never arrive before twenty to nine.\u201d The Duchess went up to her room. \u201cWell,\u201d said M. de Guermantes to Swann and myself, \u201cwe poor, down-trodden husbands, people laugh at us, but we are of some use all the same. But for me, Oriane would have been going out to dinner in black shoes.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not unbecoming,\u201d said Swann, \u201cI noticed the black shoes and they didn\u2019t offend me in the least.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t say you\u2019re wrong,\u201d replied the Duke, \u201cbut it looks better to have them to match the dress. Besides, you needn\u2019t worry, she would no sooner have got there than she\u2019d have noticed them, and I should have been obliged to come home and fetch the others. I should have had my dinner at nine o\u2019clock. Good-bye, my children,\u201d he said, thrusting us gently from the door, \u201cget away, before Oriane comes down again. It\u2019s not that she doesn\u2019t like seeing you both. On the contrary, she\u2019s too fond of your company. If she finds you still here she will start talking again, she is tired out already, she\u2019ll reach the dinner-table quite dead. Besides, I tell you frankly, I\u2019m dying of hunger. I had a wretched luncheon this morning when I came from the train. There was the devil of a b\u00e9arnaise sauce, I admit, but in spite of that I shan\u2019t be at all sorry, not at all sorry to sit down to dinner. Five minutes to eight! Oh, women, women! She\u2019ll give us both indigestion before to-morrow. She is not nearly as strong as people think.\u201d The Duke felt no compunction at speaking thus of his wife\u2019s ailments and his own to a dying man, for the former interested him more, appeared to him more important. And so it was simply from good breeding and good fellowship that, after politely shewing us out, he cried \u2018from off stage,\u2019 in a stentorian voice from the porch to Swann, who was already in the courtyard: \u201cYou, now, don\u2019t let yourself be taken in by the doctors\u2019 nonsense, damn them. They\u2019re donkeys. You\u2019re as strong as the Pont Neuf. You\u2019ll live to bury us all!\u201dEmbed"}]}, "Cordelia": {"songs": [{"song_name": "Little Life", "lyrics": "How would you have me described?\nWith light?\nWith words you think that I'd like?\nIf I

Did you really never in all our cantalang lives speak clothse to a girl\u2019s before? No! Not even to the charmermaid? How marfellows! Of course I believe you, my own dear doting liest, when you tell me. As I\u2019d live to, O, I\u2019d love to! Liss, liss! I muss whiss! Never that ever or I can remember dearstreaming faces, you may go through me! Never in all my whole white life of my match-less and pair. Or ever for bitter be the frucht of this hour!

If you met on the binge a poor acheseyeld from Ailing, when the tune of his tremble shook shimmy on shin, while his countrary raged in the weak of his wailing, like a rugilant pugi-lant Lyon O\u2019Lynn; if he maundered in misliness, plaining his plight or, played fox and lice, pricking and dropping hips teeth, or wringing his handcuffs for peace, the blind blighter, praying Dieuf and Domb Nostrums foh thomethinks to eath; if he weapt while he leapt and guffalled quith a quhimper, made cold blood a blue mundy and no bones without flech, taking kiss, kake or kick with a suck, sigh or simper, a diffle to larn and a dibble to lech; if the fain shinner pegged you to shave his immartial, wee skillmustered shoul with his ooh, hoodoodoo! brok \u2014 ing wind that to wiles, woemaid sin he was partial, we don\u2019t think, Jones, we\u2019d care to this evening, would you?\n\nAnswer: No, blank ye! So you think I have impulsivism? Did they tell you I am one of the fortysixths? And I suppose you heard I had a wag on my ears? And I suppose they told you too that my roll of life is not natural? But before proceeding to conclusively confute this begging question it would be far fitter for you, if you dare! to hasitate to consult with and consequentially attempt at my disposale of the same dime-cash problem elsewhere naturalistically of course, from the blinkpoint of so eminent a spatialist. From it you will here notice, Schott, upon my for the first remarking you that the sophology of Bitchson while driven as under by a purely dime-dime urge is not without his cashcash characktericksticks, borrowed for its nonce ends from the fiery goodmother Miss Fortune (who the lost time we had the pleasure we have had our little recherch\u201a brush with, what, Schott?) and as I further could have told you as brisk as your D.B.C. beha-viouristically paillet\u201a with a coat of homoid icing which is in reality only a done by chance ridiculisation of the whoo-whoo and where\u2019s hairs theorics of Winestain. To put it all the more plumbsily. The speechform is a mere sorrogate. Whilst the qua-lity and tality (I shall explex what you ought to mean by this with its proper when and where and why and how in the subsequent sentence) are alternativomentally harrogate and arrogate, as the gates may be.\n\nTalis is a word often abused by many passims (I am working out a quantum theory about it for it is really most tantumising state of affairs). A pessim may frequent you to say: Have you been seeing much of Talis and Talis those times? optimately meaning: Will you put up at hree of irish? Or a ladyeater may perhaps have casualised as you temptoed her \u2026 la sourdine: Of your plates? Is Talis de Talis, the swordswallower, who is on at the Craterium the same Talis von Talis, the penscrusher, no funk you! who runs his duly mile? Or this is a perhaps cleaner example. At a recent postvortex piece infustigation of a determinised case of chronic spinosis an extension lecturer on The Ague who out of matter of form was trying his seesers, Dr\u2019s Het Ubeleeft, borrowed the question: Why\u2019s which Suchman\u2019s talis qualis? to whom, as a fatter of macht, Dr Gedankje of Stoutgirth, who was wiping his whistle, toarsely retoarted: While thou beast\u2019 one zoom of a whorl!

Imagine for my purpose that you are a squad of urchins, snifflynosed, goslingnecked, clothyheaded, tangled in your lacings, tingled in your pants, etsitaraw etcicero.

Exaudi facts!\n\nThe Mookse and The Gripes.\n\nGentes and laitymen, fullstoppers and semicolonials, hybreds and lubberds!\n\nEins within a space and a wearywide space it wast ere wohned a Mookse. The onesomeness wast alltolonely, archunsitslike, broady oval, and a Mookse he would a walking go (My hood! cries Antony Romeo), so one grandsumer evening, after a great morning and his good supper of gammon and spittish, having flabelled his eyes, pilleoled his nostrils, vacticanated his ears and palliumed his throats, he put on his impermeable, seized his impugnable, harped on his crown and stepped out of his immobile De Rure Albo (socolled becauld it was chalkfull of masterplasters and had borgeously letout gardens strown with cascadas, pinta-costecas, horthoducts and currycombs) and set off from Luds \u2014 town a spasso to see how badness was badness in the weirdest of all pensible ways.\n\nAs he set off with his father\u2019s sword, his lancia spezzata, he was girded on, and with that between his legs and his tarkeels, our once in only Bragspear, he clanked, to my clinking, from veetoes to threetop, every inch of an immortal.\n\nHe had not walked over a pentiadpair of parsecs from his azylium when at the turning of the Shinshone Lanteran near Saint Bowery\u2019s-without-his-Walls he came (secunding to the one one oneth of the propecies, Amnis Limina Permanent) upon the most unconsciously boggylooking stream he ever locked his eyes with. Out of the colliens it took a rise by daubing itself Ni-non. It looked little and it smelt of brown and it thought in nar \u2014 rows and it talked showshallow. And as it rinn it dribbled like any lively purliteasy: My, my, my! Me and me! Little down dream don\u2019t I love thee!\n\nAnd, I declare, what was there on the yonder bank of the stream that would be a river, parched on a limb of the olum, bolt downright, but the Gripes? And no doubt he was fit to be dried for why had he not been having the juice of his times?\n\nHis pips had been neatly all drowned on him; his polps were charging odours every older minute; he was quickly for getting the dresser\u2019s desdaign on the flyleaf of his frons; and he was quietly for giving the bailiff\u2019s distrain on to the bulkside of his cul de Pompe. In all his specious heavings, as be lived by Opti-mus Maximus, the Mookse had never seen his Dubville brooder \u2014 on-low so nigh to a pickle.\nAdrian (that was the Mookse now\u2019s assumptinome) stuccstill phiz-\u2026-phiz to the Gripes in an accessit of aurignacian.

How do you do it? cheeped the Gripes in a wherry whiggy maudelenian woice and the jack- asses all within bawl laughed and brayed for his intentions for they knew their sly toad lowry now. I am rarumominum blessed to see you, my dear mouster. Will you not perhopes tell me everything if you are pleased, sanity? All about aulne and lithial and allsall allinall about awn and liseias?

Blast yourself and your anathomy infairioriboos! No, hang you for an animal rurale! I am superbly in my supremest poncif! Abase you, baldyqueens! Gather behind me, satraps! Rots!\n\n\u2014 I am till infinity obliged with you, bowed the Gripes, his whine having gone to his palpruy head. I am still always having a wish on all my extremities. By the watch, what is the time, pace?\n\nFigure it! The pining peever! To a Mookse!\n\u2014 Ask my index, mund my achilles, swell my obolum, wosh-up my nase serene, answered the Mookse, rapidly by turning clement, urban, eugenious and celestian in the formose of good grogory humours. Quote awhore? That is quite about what I came on my missions with my intentions laudibiliter to settle with you, barbarousse. Let thor be orlog. Let Pauline be Irene. Let you be Beeton.

Culla vosellina.\n\n\u2014 I was just thinkling upon that, swees Mooksey, but, for all the rime on my raisins, if I connow make my submission, I can-nos give you up, the Gripes whimpered from nethermost of his wanhope.

How she was brightened when Should-rups in his glaubering hochskied his welkinstuck and how she was overclused when Kneesknobs on his zwivvel was makeacting such a paulse of himshelp! She was alone. All her nubied companions were asleeping with the squirrels. Their mivver, Mrs Moonan, was off in the Fuerst quarter scrubbing the back-steps of Number 28. Fuvver, that Skand, he was up in Norwood\u2019s sokaparlour, eating oceans of Voking\u2019s Blemish. Nuvoletta lis-tened as she reflected herself, though the heavenly one with his constellatria and his emanations stood between, and she tried all she tried to make the Mookse look up at her (but he was fore too adiaptotously farseeing) and to make the Gripes hear how coy she could be (though he was much too schystimatically auricular about his ens to heed her) but it was all mild\u2019s vapour moist. Not even her feignt reflection, Nuvoluccia, could they toke their gnoses off for their minds with intrepifide fate and bungless curiasity, were conclaved with Heliogobbleus and Commodus and Enobarbarus and whatever the coordinal dickens they did as their damprauch of papyrs and buchstubs said. As if that was their spiration! As if theirs could duiparate her queendim! As if she would be third perty to search on search proceedings! She tried all the winsome wonsome ways her four winds had taught her. She tossed her sfumastelliacinous hair like le princesse de la Petite Bretagne and she rounded her mignons arms like Mrs Cornwallis\u2013West and she smiled over herself like the beauty of the image of the pose of the daughter of the queen of the Em-perour of Irelande and she sighed after herself as were she born to bride with Tristis Tristior Tristissimus. But, sweet madonine, she might fair as well have carried her daisy\u2019s worth to Florida. For the Mookse, a dogmad Accanite, were not amoosed and the Gripes, a dubliboused Catalick, wis pinefully obliviscent.\n\nI see, she sighed. There are menner.\n\nThe siss of the whisp of the sigh of the softzing at the stir of the ver grose O arundo of a long one in midias reeds: and shades began to glidder along the banks, greepsing, greepsing, duusk unto duusk, and it was as glooming as gloaming could be in the waste of all peacable worlds. Metamnisia was allsoonome coloro-form brune; citherior spiane an eaulande, innemorous and un numerose. The Mookse had a sound eyes right but he could not all hear. The Gripes had light ears left yet he could but ill see. He ceased. And he ceased, tung and trit, and it was neversoever so dusk of both of them. But still Moo thought on the deeps of the undths he would profoundth come the morrokse and still Gri feeled of the scripes he would escipe if by grice he had luck enoupes.\n\nOh, how it was duusk! From Vallee Maraia to Grasyaplaina, dormimust echo! Ah dew! Ah dew! It was so duusk that the tears of night began to fall, first by ones and twos, then by threes and fours, at last by fives and sixes of sevens, for the tired ones were wecking, as we weep now with them. O! O! O! Par la pluie!\n\nThen there came down to the thither bank a woman of no appearance (I believe she was a Black with chills at her feet) and she gathered up his hoariness the Mookse motamourfully where he was spread and carried him away to her invisible dwelling, thats hights, Aquila Rapax, for he was the holy sacred solem and poshup spit of her boshop\u2019s apron. So you see the Mookse he had reason as I knew and you knew and he knew all along. And there came down to the hither bank a woman to all important (though they say that she was comely, spite the cold in her heed) and, for he was as like it as blow it to a hawker\u2019s hank, she plucked down the Gripes, torn panicky autotone, in angeu from his limb and cariad away its beotitubes with her to her unseen shieling, it is, De Rore Coeli. And so the poor Gripes got wrong; for that is always how a Gripes is, always was and always will.be. And it was never so thoughtful of either of them. And there were left now an only elmtree and but a stone. Polled with pietrous, Sierre but saule. O! Yes! And Nuvoletta, a lass.\n\nThen Nuvoletta reflected for the last time in her little long life and she made up all her myriads of drifting minds in one. She cancelled all her engauzements. She climbed over the bannistars; she gave a childy cloudy cry: Nu\u201ae! Nu\u201ae! A lightdress fluttered. She was gone. And into the river that had been a stream (for a thousand of tears had gone eon her and come on her and she was stout and struck on dancing and her muddied name was Missis-liffi) there fell a tear, a singult tear, the loveliest of all tears (I mean for those crylove fables fans who are \u2018keen\u2019 on the pretty-pretty commonface sort of thing you meet by hopeharrods) for it was a leaptear. But the river tripped on her by and by, lapping as though her heart was brook: Why, why, why! Weh, O weh I\u2019se so silly to be flowing but I no canna stay!\n\nNo applause, please! Bast!

Nex quovis burro num fit mercaseus? I am not hereby giving my final endorsement to the learned ignorants of the Cusanus philosophism in which old Nicholas pegs it down that the smarter the spin of the top the sounder the span of the buttom (what the worthy old auberginiste ought to have meant was: the more stolidly immobile in space appears to me the bottom which is presented to use in time by the top primo-mobilisk &c.). And I shall be misunderstord if understood to give an unconditional sinequam to the heroicised furibouts of the Nolanus theory, or, at any rate, of that substrate of apart from hissheory where the Theophil swoors that on principial he was the pointing start of his odiose by comparison and that whiles eggs will fall cheapened all over the walled the Bure will be dear on the Brie.\n\nNow, while I am not out now to be taken up as unintention-ally recommending the Silkebjorg tyrondynamon machine for the more economical helixtrolysis of these amboadipates until I can find space to look into it myself a little more closely first I shall go on with my decisions after having shown to you in good time how both products of our social stomach (the excellent Dr Burroman, I noticed by the way from his emended food theory, has been carefully digesting the very wholesome criticism I helped him to in my princeps edition which is all so munch to the cud) are mutuearly polarised the incompatabilily of any delusional acting as ambivalent to the fixation of his pivotism. Positing, as above, too males pooles, the one the pictor of the other and the omber the Skotia of the one, and looking want-ingly around our undistributed middle between males we feel we must waistfully woent a female to focus and on this stage there pleasantly appears the cowrymaid M. whom we shall often meet below who introduces herself upon us at some precise hour which we shall again agree to call absolute zero or the babbling pumpt of platinism. And so like that former son of a kish who went up and out to found his farmer\u2019s ashes we come down home gently on our own turnedabout asses to meet Margareen.\n\nWe now romp through a period of pure lyricism of shame-bred music (technologically, let me say, the appetising entry of this subject on a fool chest of vialds is plumply pudding the carp before doevre hors) evidenced by such words in distress as I cream for thee, Sweet Margareen, and the more hopeful O Mar-gareena! O Margareena! Still in the bowl is left a lump of gold! (Correspondents, by the way, will keep on asking me what is the correct garnish to serve drisheens with. Tansy Sauce. Enough). The pawnbreaking pathos of the first of these shoddy pieces reveals it as a Caseous effort. Burrus\u2019s bit is often used for a toast. Criniculture can tell us very precisely indeed how and why this particular streak of yellow silver first appeared on (not in) the bowel, that is to see, the human head, bald, black, bronze, brown, brindled, betteraved or blanchemanged where it might be use-fully compared with an earwig on a fullbottom. I am offering this to Signorina Cuticura and I intend to take it up and bring it under the nosetice of Herr Harlene by way of diverting his attentions. Of course the unskilled singer continues to pervert our wiser ears by subordinating the space-element, that is to sing, the aria, to the time-factor, which ought to be killed, ill tempor. I should advise any unborn singer who may still be among my heeders to forget her temporal diaphragm at home (the best thing that could happen to it!) and attack the roulade with a swift colpo di glottide to the lug (though Maace I will insist was reclined from overdoing this, his recovery often being slow) and then, O! on the third dead beat, O! to cluse her eyes and aiopen her oath and see what spice I may send her. How? Cease thee, cantatrickee! I fain would be solo. Arouse thee, my valour! And save for e\u2019er my true Bdur!\n\nI shall have a word to say in a few yards about the acoustic and orchidectural management of the tonehall but, as ours is a vivarious where one plant\u2019s breaf is a lunger planner\u2019s byscent and you may not care for argon, it will be very convenient for me for the emolument to pursue Burrus and Caseous for a rung or two up their isocelating biangle. Every admirer has seen my goulache of Marge (she is so like the sister, you don\u2019t know, and they both dress A L I K E!) which I titled The Very Picture of a Needlesswoman which in the presence ornates our national cruetstand. This genre of portraiture of changes of mind in order to be truly torse should evoke the bush soul of females so I am leaving it to the experienced victim to complete the general suggestion by the mental addition of a wallopy bound or, should the zulugical zealot prefer it, a congorool teal. The hatboxes which composed Rhomba, lady Trabezond (Marge in her ex-celsis), also comprised the climactogram up which B and C may fondly be imagined ascending and are suggestive of gentlemen\u2019s spring modes, these modes carrying us back to the superimposed claylayers of eocene and pleastoseen formation and the gradual morphological changes in our body politic which Professor Ebahi\u2013Ahuri of Philadespoinis (Ill) \u2014 whose bluebutterbust I have just given his coupe de grass to \u2014 neatly names a bo\u0152te \u2026 surprises. The boxes, if I may break the subject gently, are worth about fourpence pourbox but I am inventing a more patent pro-cess, foolproof and pryperfect (I should like to ask that Shedlock Homes person who is out for removing the roofs of our criminal classics by what deductio ad domunum he hopes de tacto to detect anything unless he happens of himself, movibile tectu, to have a slade off) after which they can be reduced to a fragment of their true crust by even the youngest of Margees if she will take plase to be seated and smile if I please.\n\nNow there can be no question about it either that I having done as much, have quite got the size of that demilitery young female (we will continue to call her Marge) whose types may be met with in any public garden, wearing a very \u201cdressy\u201d affair, known as an \u201cethel\u201d of instep length and with a real fur, reduced to 3/9, and muffin cap to tone (they are \u201cangelskin\u201d this fall), ostentatiously hemming apologetically over the shirtness of some \u201csweet\u201d garment, when she is not sitting on all the free benches avidously reading about \u201cit\u201d but ovidently on the look out for \u201chim\u201d or so \u201cthrilled\u201d about the best dressed dolly pram and beautiful elbow competition or at the movies swallowing sobs and blowing bixed mixcuits over \u201cchilde\u201d chaplain\u2019s \u201clatest\u201d or on the verge of the gutter with some bobbedhair brieffrocked babyma\u2019s toddler (the Smythe\u2013Smythes now keep TWO domes-tics and aspire to THREE male ones, a shover, a butlegger and a sectary) held hostage at armslength, teaching His Infant Majesty how to make waters worse.\n\n(I am closely watching Master Pules, as I have regions to sus-pect from my post that her \u201clitde man\u201d is a secondary school \u2014 teacher under the boards of education, a voted disciple of Infan \u2014 tulus who is being utilised thus publicly by the seducente infanta to conceal her own more mascular personality by flaunting frivolish finery over men\u2019s inside clothes, for the femininny of that totamulier will always lack the musculink of a verumvirum. My solotions for the proper parturience of matres and the edu-cation of micturious mites must stand over from the moment till I tackle this tickler hussy for occupying my uttentions.)\n\nMargareena she\u2019s very fond of Burrus but, alick and alack! she velly fond of chee. (The important influence exercised on everything by this eastasian import has not been till now fully flavoured though we can comfortably taste it in this case. I shall come back for a little more say farther on.) A cleopatrician in her own right she at once complicates the position while Burrus and Caseous are contending for her misstery by implicating her- self with an elusive Antonius, a wop who would appear to hug a personal interest in refined chees of all chades at the same time as he wags an antomine art of being rude like the boor. This Antonius\u2013Burrus-Caseous grouptriad may be said to equate the qualis equivalent with the older socalled talis on talis one just as quantly as in the hyperchemical economantarchy the tan-tum ergons irruminate the quantum urge so that eggs is to whey as whay is to zeed like your golfchild\u2019s abe boob caddy. And this is why any simple philadolphus of a fool you like to dress, an athemisthued lowtownian, exlegged phatrisight, may be awfully green to one side of him and fruitfully blue on the other which will not screen him however from appealing to my gropesarching eyes, through the strongholes of my acropoll, as a boosted blasted bleating blatant bloaten blasphorus blesphorous idiot who kennot tail a bomb from a painapple when he steals one and wannot psing his psalmen with the cong in our gregational pompoms with the canting crew.\n\nNo!

Sacer esto?\n\nAnswer: Semus sumus!Embed"}, {"song_name": "Not So Sure", "lyrics": "1 ContributorThe Mayor of Casterbridge (Chap. 3) LyricsThe highroad into the village of Weydon-Priors was again carpeted with dust. The trees had put on as of yore their aspect of dingy green, and where the Henchard family of three had once walked along, two persons not unconnected with the family walked now.\nThe scene in its broad aspect had so much of its previous character, even to the voices and rattle from the neighbouring village down, that it might for that matter have been the afternoon following the previously recorded episode. Change was only to be observed in details; but here it was obvious that a long procession of years had passed by. One of the two who walked the road was she who had figured as the young wife of Henchard on the previous occasion; now her face had lost much of its rotundity; her skin had undergone a textural change; and though her hair had not lost colour it was considerably thinner than heretofore. She was dressed in the mourning clothes of a widow. Her companion, also in black, appeared as a well-formed young woman about eighteen, completely possessed of that ephemeral precious essence youth, which is itself beauty, irrespective of complexion or contour.\n\nA glance was sufficient to inform the eye that this was Susan Henchard's grown-up daughter. While life's middle summer had set its hardening mark on the mother's face, her former spring-like specialities were transferred so dexterously by Time to the second figure, her child, that the absence of certain facts within her mother's knowledge from the girl's mind would have seemed for the moment, to one reflecting on those facts, to be a curious imperfection in Nature's powers of continuity.\n\nThey walked with joined hands, and it could be perceived that this was the act of simple affection. The daughter carried in her outer hand a withy basket of old-fashioned make; the mother a blue bundle, which contrasted oddly with her black stuff gown.\n\nReaching the outskirts of the village they pursued the same track as formerly, and ascended to the fair. Here, too it was evident that the years had told. Certain mechanical improvements might have been noticed in the roundabouts and high-fliers, machines for testing rustic strength and weight, and in the erections devoted to shooting for nuts. But the real business of the fair had considerably dwindled. The new periodical great markets of neighbouring towns were beginning to interfere seriously with the trade carried on here for centuries. The pens for sheep, the tie-ropes for horses, were about half as long as they had been. The stalls of tailors, hosiers, coopers, linen-drapers, and other such trades had almost disappeared, and the vehicles were far less numerous. The mother and daughter threaded the crowd for some little distance, and then stood still.\n\n\"Why did we hinder our time by coming in here? I thought you wished to get onward?\" said the maiden.\n\"Yes, my dear Elizabeth-Jane,\" explained the other. \"But I had a fancy for looking up here.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"It was here I first met with Newson\u2014on such a day as this.\"\n\n\"First met with father here? Yes, you have told me so before. And now he's drowned and gone from us!\" As she spoke the girl drew a card from her pocket and looked at it with a sigh. It was edged with black, and inscribed within a design resembling a mural tablet were the words, \"In affectionate memory of Richard Newson, mariner, who was unfortunately lost at sea, in the month of November 184\u2014, aged forty-one years.\"\n\n\"And it was here,\" continued her mother, with more hesitation, \"that I last saw the relation we are going to look for\u2014Mr. Michael Henchard.\"\n\n\"What is his exact kin to us, mother? I have never clearly had it told me.\"\n\n\"He is, or was\u2014for he may be dead\u2014a connection by marriage,\" said her mother deliberately.\n\n\"That's exactly what you have said a score of times before!\" replied the young woman, looking about her inattentively. \"He's not a near relation, I suppose?\"\n\"Not by any means.\"\n\n\"He was a hay-trusser, wasn't he, when you last heard of him?\n\n\"He was.\"\n\n\"I suppose he never knew me?\" the girl innocently continued.\n\nMrs. Henchard paused for a moment, and answered un-easily, \"Of course not, Elizabeth-Jane. But come this way.\" She moved on to another part of the field.\n\n\"It is not much use inquiring here for anybody, I should think,\" the daughter observed, as she gazed round about. \"People at fairs change like the leaves of trees; and I daresay you are the only one here to-day who was here all those years ago.\"\n\n\"I am not so sure of that,\" said Mrs. Newson, as she now called herself, keenly eyeing something under a green bank a little way off. \"See there.\"\n\nThe daughter looked in the direction signified. The object pointed out was a tripod of sticks stuck into the earth, from which hung a three-legged crock, kept hot by a smouldering wood fire beneath. Over the pot stooped an old woman haggard, wrinkled, and almost in rags. She stirred the contents of the pot with a large spoon, and occasionally croaked in a broken voice, \"Good furmity sold here!\"\n\nIt was indeed the former mistress of the furmity tent\u2014once thriving, cleanly, white-aproned, and chinking with money\u2014now tentless, dirty, owning no tables or benches, and having scarce any customers except two small whity-brown boys, who came up and asked for \"A ha'p'orth, please\u2014good measure,\" which she served in a couple of chipped yellow basins of commonest clay.\n\n\"She was here at that time,\" resumed Mrs. Newson, making a step as if to draw nearer.\n\n\"Don't speak to her\u2014it isn't respectable!\" urged the other.\n\n\"I will just say a word\u2014you, Elizabeth-Jane, can stay here.\"\n\nThe girl was not loth, and turned to some stalls of coloured prints while her mother went forward. The old woman begged for the latter's custom as soon as she saw her, and responded to Mrs. Henchard-Newson's request for a pennyworth with more alacrity than she had shown in selling six-pennyworths in her younger days. When the soi-disant widow had taken the basin of thin poor slop that stood for the rich concoction of the former time, the hag opened a little basket behind the fire, and looking up slily, whispered, \"Just a thought o' rum in it?\u2014smuggled, you know\u2014say two penn'orth\u2014'twill make it slip down like cordial!\"\nHer customer smiled bitterly at this survival of the old trick, and shook her head with a meaning the old woman was far from translating. She pretended to eat a little of the furmity with the leaden spoon offered, and as she did so said blandly to the hag, \"You've seen better days?\"\n\n\"Ah, ma'am\u2014well ye may say it!\" responded the old woman, opening the sluices of her heart forthwith. \"I've stood in this fair-ground, maid, wife, and widow, these nine-and-thirty years, and in that time have known what it was to do business with the richest stomachs in the land! Ma'am you'd hardly believe that I was once the owner of a great pavilion-tent that was the attraction of the fair. Nobody could come, nobody could go, without having a dish of Mrs. Goodenough's furmity. I knew the clergy's taste, the dandy gent's taste; I knew the town's taste, the country's taste. I even knowed the taste of the coarse shameless females. But Lord's my life\u2014the world's no memory; straightforward dealings don't bring profit\u2014'tis the sly and the underhand that get on in these times!\"\n\nMrs. Newson glanced round\u2014her daughter was still bending over the distant stalls. \"Can you call to mind,\" she said cautiously to the old woman, \"the sale of a wife by her husband in your tent eighteen years ago to-day?\"\n\nThe hag reflected, and half shook her head. \"If it had been a big thing I should have minded it in a moment,\" she said. \"I can mind every serious fight o' married parties, every murder, every manslaughter, even every pocket-picking\u2014leastwise large ones\u2014that 't has been my lot to witness. But a selling? Was it done quiet-like?\"\n\n\"Well, yes. I think so.\"\n\nThe furmity woman half shook her head again. \"And yet,\" she said, \"I do. At any rate, I can mind a man doing something o' the sort\u2014a man in a cord jacket, with a basket of tools; but, Lord bless ye, we don't gi'e it head-room, we don't, such as that. The only reason why I can mind the man is that he came back here to the next year's fair, and told me quite private-like that if a woman ever asked for him I was to say he had gone to\u2014where?\u2014Casterbridge\u2014yes\u2014to Casterbridge, said he. But, Lord's my life, I shouldn't ha' thought of it again!\"\n\nMrs. Newson would have rewarded the old woman as far as her small means afforded had she not discreetly borne in mind that it was by that unscrupulous person's liquor her husband had been degraded. She briefly thanked her informant, and rejoined Elizabeth, who greeted her with, \"Mother, do let's get on\u2014it was hardly respectable for you to buy refreshments there. I see none but the lowest do.\"\n\n\"I have learned what I wanted, however,\" said her mother quietly. \"The last time our relative visited this fair he said he was living at Casterbridge.

met\nWas it a blessing or a curse?\nAnother memory I kept to keep you always on my mind\nYou are always on my mind\nYou are always on my mind\nYou are always\nYou know what you mean to me\nYou might also like\nMoving in slow, slow motion\nIf-if-if I could stop time for real\nWould make it any easier for me to love you?\n'Cause you know I'm shy for you still\nSo bad that it kills\nAnd I can't help

Full of \"Bang Bang\" adlibs and rowdy trap classics, it became the basis for modern Hip-Hop and established Keef's status as a heavy inspiration in the genre at seventeen years old. The album begins with one of music's greatest introductions, with avid fan Jordan Gilty ranting about haters, which leads into the iconic hit single \"Love Sosa.\" As the album progresses, Keef continues to release more impressive drill tracks, including the irate \"I Don't Like,\" which was even remixed by Kanye West and included on Cruel Summer. Finally Rich also boasts impressive features from Cozart's contemporaries like Wiz Khalifa, 50 Cent, and even French Montana. Finally Rich's influence on modern Hip-Hop is profound, and this timeless album certainly holds its ground for this decade and will continue to inspire next generation rap.\n\nALBUM: Travis Scott, ASTROWORLD\nAUTHOR: @UnderstandingRap\nWRITE-UP: Houston native and Kanye West prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Travis Scott returned to his roots with the 2018 album ASTROWORLD. Since the release of Rodeo, many of Scott's fans were disappointed with the newer albums of BITTSM and HJ,JH, but Travis took it back to his hometown to release the critically acclaimed and Billboard 200 topping masterpiece ASTROWORLD. Named after an old amusement park in Houston, this roller coaster ride of an album features relaxed songs like \"ASTROTHUNDER,\" lyrical tracks like \"HOUSTONFORNICATION,\" as well as raging anthems such as \"NO BYSTANDERS\" and the chart topping single \"SICKO MODE.\" Scott's third solo album was an incredibly important moment for him, as the record details his new relationship with Kylie Jenner and his transition into fatherhood. ASTROWORLD can be viewed in two different lights: a return to Scott's old self or the reinvention of an artist, but above all, it's just an amazing album.\n\nALBUM: Young Thug, Barter 6\nAUTHOR: @UnderstandingRap\nWRITE-UP: Young Thug's debut commercial mixtape Barter 6 is an essential trap album and cheat sheet for the new school of Hip-Hop. The title comes from Thugger's idol, Lil Wayne, as Jeffery felt that he was continuing Wayne's legacy with his Tha Carter series. As far as album content goes, Thugger has perfected his craft since I Came From Nothing and 1017 Thug, and features his mentors, trap icons, and solo cuts. Some of Thugger's most prominent works over his career, like \"Halftime\" and \"Numbers\", are all featured on this masterpiece album. Chief among Thugger's works, however, is easily \"Check\". This ad-lib filled track about making money quickly became an Atlanta anthem and even charted on the Billboard Hot 100. Barter 6 still holds its ground as one of the greatest trap albums of all time, and Thugger's heavy inspiration on recent rap freshman only proves how inspiring this album is.\n\n\u201cThe Genius Community's 50 Best Albums & 50 Best Songs of 2019\u201d\nALBUM: So Much Fun\nAUTHOR: @UnderstandingRap\nWRITE-UP: Easily the best trap album to come out of this year, So Much Fun sees Young Thug at his prime, perfecting unique flows and reestablishing his status as godfather of the booming Atlanta music scene. Thugger shows massive improvement in his versatility as an artist, a seemingly impossible feat coming from a founder of Country-Rap and one of the most influential artists of all time. Thug's solo records on So Much Fun are the epitome of his evolution, and the artists which he features reaffirm his hold on the industry, as artists such as Lil Uzi Vert, Gunna, Juice WRLD, Lil Baby, and Lil Keed have all been taught by Thug, signed to his YSL label, or cited him as having an impact in their sound. Song for song and flow for flow, So Much Fun is a defining album of 2019, and with Thug's stronghold on the rap game, it is sure to constantly inspire the new generation of rap and force his competitors to step up their music.\n\nALBUM: The Plugs I Met\nAUTHOR: @UnderstandingRap\nWRITE-UP: Inspired by a line on November 2018's \"Broken Bottles\"---\"I heard they sick about me rapping \u2018bout the drugs I stretch / I\u2019ma write a whole album \u2018bout the plugs I met\"---Benny the Butcher's 8th project, aptly titled The Plugs I Met, sees him at his lyrical best. Assembling an all-star feature list, including OGs in hip-hop like Black Thought of The Roots and Jadakiss as well as the most consistent lyricists in 2019 such as Pusha T, Benny and his collaborators flows over smooth instrumentals and spit some of the best raps in recent years. The Plugs I Met is a standout album for this year, and Benny's ability to meld his stories of selling drugs with fine raps solidifies it's high placement for the end of 2019.\n\n\nSONG: RICKY\nAUTHOR: @UnderstandingRap\nWRITE-UP: Denzel Curry's \"RICKY\" is an absolutely essential single of 2019. This track discusses his hometown in Carol City, Florida, as well as his basic family values and life lessons, such as loyalty and respect---advice given to him by his siblings and mother, but especially his father, the namesake of the single. Denzel's ability to deepen his voice and alternate flows from the pre-chorus to the verses is mesmerizing as he shifts the focus of the song to his influences and come up with SpaceGhostPurrp's Raider Klan. On \"RICKY\", Denzel Curry breaks free from his underrated, underground self and legitimizes himself as one of the most talented rappers in the new school.\nSONG: \"Babushka Boi\"\nAUTHOR: @UnderstandingRap\nWRITE-UP: A$AP Rocky channeled his inner Tony Montana in \"Babushka Boi\"---an ode to the blemish on his right cheek---for one of the greatest songs of 2019. Named after his personal fashion movement which spawned countless memes and innumerable questions, Rocky remained traditional with stellar flows and flashy lyrics. Rocky uses the themes of the 1983 film Scarface, being drugs, money, and violence to boast about his wild lifestyle, unpredictable tendencies, and high-class status. Releasing shortly after Rocky was arrested and found guilty of assault charges in Sweden, the #FreeRocky movement, which attracted the likes of Travis Scott and President Donald Trump alike, came together at the release of \"Babushka Boi\", easily one of Rocky's greatest singles in recent years. At the time when Rocky's legal status was clouded and troublesome, the new release became to beacon for fans and a classic song days upon release.\n\n\nSONG: Bandit\nAUTHOR: @UnderstandingRap\nWRITE-UP: From the beginning of \"Bandit\", the late Chicago rapper Juice WRLD warned his fans that this song would be like nothing they have ever heard before---\"It's funny, the shit I put on this song ain't gon' sound nothin' like the shit we was just doin'\". Accompanied by rising star YoungBoy Never Broke Again for a song about stealing hearts, taking medication, and shooting firearms, WRLD steps out of his more cloud and emo rap singles like December 2017's \"All Girls Are the Same\" and February 2019's \"Robbery\" for the trap themed collaboration. Juice especially raps on of his most impressive verses ever and holds admirable flow along the song in a manner which he never fully explored during his career in the music industry. R.I.P. Juice WRLD, you were an inspiration to many and will be missed.\n\n\nSONG: Crown For Kings\nAUTHOR: @UnderstandingRap\nWRITE-UP: Although many have claimed to be the Greatest Of All Time (G.O.A.T) or the leader of hip-hop, \"Crown For Kings\" leaves little debate as to who sits on the throne of the rap game. BENNY THE BUTCHER, accompanied by the legendary lyricist Black Thought of The Roots, demands his crown and the respect as royalty which he rightfully deserves after this incredible, jaw-dropping rhapsodic track. The braggadocios lyrics, beautiful instrumental sample of Al Green's October 1972 Al Green track \"Look What You Done for Me,\" and consistent bars by some of rap's finest all make for one of the best, and most lyrical, tracks of the year. BENNY and Thought have a bold stake to claim, but with the sheer magnificence of \"Crown For Kings,\" it is safe to say that they deserve their spot in the Hall of Fame.\n\n\nSONG: Sanguine Paradise\nAUTHOR: @UnderstandingRap\nWRITE-UP: Lil Uzi Vert returned to his devoted fans with \"Sanguine Paradise\"---the holy grail of Uzi's casual routine and wild career. Dedicated to his fast cars, loud firearms, exclusive fashion sense, and an infatuation with one lucky girl, Woods' return to music following the removal of March 2019's  \"Free Uzi\" from streaming services and the fan's distress and lack of hope with the ever-delayed Eternal Atake makes the single all the more glamorous. Although the remainder of 2019 was quiet for Philly's most fashionable star, hopefully 2020 will have a better horizon and a handful of more releases.\n\ntesting"}, {"song_name": "One Of The Girls - A Cappella", "lyrics": "Lock me up and throw away the key\nHe knows how to get the best out of me\nI'm no force for the world to see\nTrade my whole life just to be\n\n\nTell nobody I control you\nI broke you just to own you\nThey can\u2019t tell but I love you\n'Cause you're loyal, baby\nI love when you\u2019re submissive\nYou love it when I break skin\nYou feel pain without flinchin'\nSo say it\n\n\nGive me tough love\nLeave me with nothin' when I come down\nMy kind of love\nForce me and choke me 'til I pass out\n\n\nWe don't gotta be in love, no\nI don't gotta be the one, no\nI just wanna be one of your girls tonight\nWe don't gotta be in love, no\nI don't gotta be the one, no\nI just wanna be one of your girls tonight, oh\nYou might also like\nPush me down, hold me down\nSpit in my mouth while you turn me out\nI wanna take your light inside\nTear me down, snuff me out\nHands on my neck while you push it up\nAnd I\u2019m screamin\u2019 now\n\n\nGive me tough love\nLeave me with nothin' when I come down\nMy kind of love\nForce me and choke me \u2019til I pass out\n\n\nWe don't gotta be in love, no\nI don't gotta be the one, no\nI just wanna be one of your girls tonight (Tonight)\nWe don't gotta be in love, no\nI don\u2019t gotta be the one, no (Oh)\nI just wanna be one of your girls tonight, oh\n\n\nLock me up and throw away the key\nHe knows how to get the best out of me\nI'm no force for the world to see\nTrade my whole life just to be\nTop of the world, but I'm still not free\nThis is a secret that I keep\nUntil it's gone, I can never find peace\nWaste my whole life just to be\n\nWe don't gotta be in love, no\nI don't gotta be the one, no\nI just wanna be one of your girls tonight (Tonight)\nWe don't gotta be in love, no\nI don't gotta be the one, no (Oh)\nI just wanna be one of your girls tonight (Oh), ohEmbed"}]}, "Lily Rose Depp": {"songs": [{"song_name": "One Of The Girls (with JENNIE, Lily Rose Depp)", "lyrics": "1 ContributorNew Music Friday 06/23/23 LyricsPeso Pluma & Junior H - LUNA\nYoung Thug - Oh U Went (feat.

ContributorsDenuncia Nisman LyricsFORMULA DENUNCIA\n\nMinisterio P\u00fablico de la Naci\u00f3n\n\\ *\u2022\n\n\nSr. Juez Federal Dr. Ariel O. Lijo:\nALBERTO NISMAN, Fiscal General, titular de la Unidad Fiscal de Investigaci\u00f3n del atentado perpetrado el 18 de julio de 1994 contra la sede de la AMIA  ante V.S. respetuosamente me presento y digo:\n\nI.- Objeto\nEn cumplimiento del mandato legal impuesto en el art\u00edculo 177 inciso Io del C\u00f3digo Procesal Penal de la Naci\u00f3n, como representante del Ministerio P\u00fablico Fiscal a cargo de la Unidad de Investigaci\u00f3n de la causa \u201cAMIA\u201d vengo, por la presente, a denunciar la existencia de un plan delictivo destinado a dotar de impunidad a los imputados de nacionalidad iran\u00ed acusados en dicha causa, para que eludan la investigaci\u00f3n y se sustraigan de la acci\u00f3n de la justicia argentina, con competencia en el caso.\nEsta confabulaci\u00f3n ha sido orquestada y puesta en funcionamiento por altas autoridades del gobierno nacional argentino, con la colaboraci\u00f3n de terceros, en lo que constituye un accionar criminal configurativo, a priori, de los delitos de encubrimiento por favorecimiento\npersonal agravado, impedimento o estorbo del acto funcional e incumplimiento de los deberes de funcionario p\u00fablico (arts. 277 inc. 1 y 3, 241 inc. 2 y 248 del C\u00f3digo Penal). Esto resulta de la mayor gravedad teniendo en cuenta que el hecho cuyo encubrimiento se denuncia, es decir, el atentado terrorista perpetrado contra la sede de la AMIA, ha sido judicialmente declarado crimen de lesa humanidad y calificado como genocidio por el Sr. Juez de la causa.\nLa decisi\u00f3n deliberada de encubrir a los imputados de origen iran\u00ed acusados por el atentado terrorista del 18 de julio de 1994, como surge de las evidencias halladas, fue tomada por la cabeza del Poder Ejecutivo Nacional, Dra. Cristina Elisabet Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner e instrumentada, principalmente, por el Ministro de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto de la Naci\u00f3n, Sr. H\u00e9ctor Marcos Timerman.\nAsimismo, las pruebas examinadas revelan la intervenci\u00f3n activa en el plan encubridor de varios sujetos con distintos grados de participaci\u00f3n y responsabilidad que la pesquisa deber\u00e1 precisar, entre los que cabe mencionar a: Luis Angel D\u2019El\u00eda, Femando Luis Esteche, Jorge Alejandro \u201cYussuf\u2019 Khalil, el Diputado Nacional Andr\u00e9s Larroque, el Dr. H\u00e9ctor Luis Yrimia y un individuo identificado como \u201cAlian\u201d, que ha desempe\u00f1ado un rol por dem\u00e1s relevante en los hechos, que responde a la Secretaria de Inteligencia de Presidencia de la Naci\u00f3n y seg\u00fan lo sugieren los indicios obtenidos, se tratar\u00eda del Sr. Ram\u00f3n Alian H\u00e9ctor Bogado.\nPor otra parte, la investigaci\u00f3n deber\u00e1 tambi\u00e9n determinar el rol exacto que le cupo a ciertos individuos respecto de quienes, prima facie, se cuenta con elementos que permiten colegir que no resultan ajenos a la maniobra delictiva denunciada, entre los cabe mencionar al Ministro de Planificaci\u00f3n Federal, Inversi\u00f3n P\u00fablica y Servicios de la Naci\u00f3n, Arquitecto Julio De Vido.\nPor \u00faltimo, corresponde a la pesquisa aqu\u00ed propiciada la individualizaci\u00f3n y la determinaci\u00f3n de la responsabilidad penal que en los hechos delictivos denunciados pudieron haber tenido todas aquellas personas -funcionarios o no- que intervinieron en la elaboraci\u00f3n,\nnegociaci\u00f3n, concreci\u00f3n y consumaci\u00f3n del acuerdo firmado con la Rep\u00fablica Isl\u00e1mica de Ir\u00e1n, como una de las v\u00edas para lograr la impunidad. Esto incluye tanto a aquellos cuyos roles fueron de p\u00fablico conocimiento, como a quienes eventualmente hayan participado sin que su intervenci\u00f3n haya tomado estado p\u00fablico.\n\nIntroducci\u00f3n:\nA lo largo de esta denuncia se expondr\u00e1n los elementos probatorios que dejan en evidencia la existencia de un sofisticado plan delictivo, deliberadamente ideado para encubrir y dotar de impunidad a los acusados iran\u00edes en la causa seguida por el atentado contra la sede de la AMIA, con el objeto de que eludan definitivamente a la justicia argentina y se sustraigan de ella.\nSe ver\u00e1 tambi\u00e9n que, para la \u00e9poca en que se urdi\u00f3 e instrument\u00f3 el plan criminal, la urgencia energ\u00e9tica que atravesaba y atraviesa nuestro pa\u00eds y el anhelo por restablecer plenas relaciones comerciales a nivel estatal, ligados a una visi\u00f3n geopol\u00edtica de acercamiento con la Rep\u00fablica Isl\u00e1mica de Ir\u00e1n fueron, seg\u00fan las pruebas con que se cuenta, los factores determinantes para que la primera mandataria, Dra. Cristina Elisabet Fern\u00e1ndez, con la necesaria e inestimable participaci\u00f3n y colaboraci\u00f3n de H\u00e9ctor Timerman, tomara la aciaga decisi\u00f3n de llevar adelante este plan de impunidad, sacrificando la justicia en el caso AMIA.\nEn efecto, quedar\u00e1 acreditado que esta confabulaci\u00f3n criminal fue decidida por la Sra. Presidente de la Naci\u00f3n y puesta en funcionamiento, principalmente, por su Ministro de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto, H\u00e9ctor Marcos Timerman. Asimismo, se probar\u00e1 la activa participaci\u00f3n criminal de terceros en la maniobra, entre los que cabe mencionar a Luis \u00c1ngel D\u2019El\u00eda; a Jorge Alejandro \u201cYussuf\u2019 Khalil, al Diputado Nacional Andr\u00e9s Larroque, a Fernando Esteche, al ex Fiscal designado para actuar en forma conjunta,\nalterna o sucesiva en la causa AMIA, H\u00e9ctor Luis Yrimia y a un individuo perteneciente a la Secretar\u00eda de Inteligencia de Presidencia de la Naci\u00f3n, identificado como \u201cAlian\u201d que, seg\u00fan las constancias halladas, todo indica que se tratar\u00eda de Ram\u00f3n Alian H\u00e9ctor Bogado.\nEn ese sentido, se presentar\u00e1n las pruebas que ilustran que el plan que aqu\u00ed se denuncia incluy\u00f3 negociaciones secretas y p\u00fablicas con los iran\u00edes, durante las cuales se acord\u00f3 dar de baja las notificaciones rojas de Interpol, y que dichas tratativas desembocaron en la firma de un Memorando de Entendimiento que, en su esencia, debe ser considerado como lo que realmente es: apenas uno de los medios elegidos por los aqu\u00ed acusados para garantizar lo que se hab\u00eda acordado de antemano, esto es, la impunidad de los pr\u00f3fugos iran\u00edes y su desvinculaci\u00f3n definitiva de la causa.\nComo se ver\u00e1 en detalle durante el desarrollo de la denuncia y se adelantar\u00e1 unos p\u00e1rrafos m\u00e1s abajo, la firma y ratificaci\u00f3n de tal documento implica lisa y llanamente la destrucci\u00f3n de las imputaciones contra los acusados de nacionalidad iran\u00ed. En primer lugar, porque las conclusiones de la llamada \u201cComisi\u00f3n de la Verdad\u201d, como as\u00ed lo revela la evidencia, ya se encontraban previamente arregladas entre los signatarios. En segunda medida, como se verific\u00f3 en los hechos, debido a que el acuerdo fue la excusa que esgrimieron las partes para solicitar a Interpol que diera de baja las notificaciones rojas. En tercer t\u00e9rmino, porque su confusa y ambigua redacci\u00f3n y las innumerables fases sucesivas previstas, sin plazo alguno, para que sus disposiciones sean aplicadas, permite que los socios en este acuerdo de impunidad aludan indefinidamente a la existencia del Memorando, aunque en la pr\u00e1ctica no produzca efecto legal alguno.\nTambi\u00e9n, se probar\u00e1 que el plan de impunidad perge\u00f1ado por la Sra. Presidente de la Naci\u00f3n incluy\u00f3 un cambio de hip\u00f3tesis y un redireccionamiento de la investigaci\u00f3n judicial del caso AMIA, hacia \u201cnuevos imputados\u201d, fundado en pruebas falsas y destinado a desvincular definitiva y fraudulentamente a los acusados iran\u00edes. De hecho, algunos de los aqu\u00ed acusados estuvieron expresamente abocados a fabricar esta hip\u00f3tesis falsa. Sab\u00edan que la \u201cComisi\u00f3n de la Verdad\u201d no hab\u00eda sido creada para investigar absolutamente nada, sino para legitimar la mentira que se estaba fabricando.\nSe acreditar\u00e1 que este plan criminal tambi\u00e9n involucr\u00f3 acuerdos secretos, por fuera del Memorando de Entendimiento. As\u00ed, se concert\u00f3 -en forma oculta- el cese de las notificaciones rojas de Interpol que pesaban y pesan sobre los funcionarios iran\u00edes, por ser el inter\u00e9s cardinal de Teher\u00e1n para suscribir el acuerdo. Asimismo, se probar\u00e1 que secretamente se hab\u00eda pactado que, en la pr\u00e1ctica, el ex Ministro de Defensa iran\u00ed y actual pr\u00f3fugo de la justicia argentina, Ahmad Vahidi, jam\u00e1s ser\u00eda interrogado, a pesar de lo estipulado en el Memorando, pues as\u00ed hab\u00eda sido convenido entre las partes: \u201cya hab\u00eda sido conversado antes\u201d.\nAdem\u00e1s, quedar\u00e1 evidenciado que los funcionarios involucrados en este plan criminal, ya sean argentinos o iran\u00edes, han tenido un objetivo com\u00fan. Que no se trata de dos partes negociando un acuerdo, como se lo quiso presentar p\u00fablicamente, sino de dos socios buscando borrar -sin que nadie lo advierta- una imputaci\u00f3n penal en un delito de lesa humanidad.\nM\u00e1s a\u00fan, aqu\u00ed se demostrar\u00e1 que los pasos y avances del plan criminal fueron comunicados en tiempo real no solo a las autoridades iran\u00edes, sino tambi\u00e9n a uno de los pr\u00f3fugos de la causa AMIA, Mohsen Rabbani, quien particip\u00f3 de negociaciones comerciales con las autoridades argentinas involucradas en este plan e intervino en las tratativas dirigidas - fundamentalmente- a garantizar su propia impunidad.\nTambi\u00e9n quedar\u00e1 evidenciado que se lanz\u00f3 una feroz campa\u00f1a de descr\u00e9dito hacia la investigaci\u00f3n del caso, destinada a horadar la versi\u00f3n judicial de los hechos, y se la combin\u00f3 con una campa\u00f1a de enga\u00f1o, compuesta por falacias, puestas en escena, mentiras, desmentidas, falsas promesas y la manipulaci\u00f3n a sobrevivientes y familiares de las v\u00edctimas del atentado, a fin de evitar que la opini\u00f3n p\u00fablica conozca la entidad del verdadero objetivo encubridor oculto detr\u00e1s del Memorando de Entendimiento firmado con Ir\u00e1n.\nAsimismo, se expondr\u00e1n los elementos de prueba que acreditan que la Sra. Presidente y el Sr. Canciller efectuaron aportes en la necesaria divisi\u00f3n de tareas que implic\u00f3 esta compleja maniobra delictiva.\nDe las contribuciones concretas y espec\u00edficas de la Sra. Presidente que se han podido acreditar con s\u00f3lido sustento probatorio, surge con claridad que no solamente fue quien decidi\u00f3 la articulaci\u00f3n de este plan criminal de impunidad, sino que, para ello, se vali\u00f3 de distintos actores para llevar adelante su ejecuci\u00f3n, y en todo momento estuvo en control de la misma, ya sea impartiendo \u00f3rdenes directas a sus c\u00f3mplices, o bien encabezando la campa\u00f1a discursiva y medi\u00e1tica necesaria para camuflar la perpetraci\u00f3n del delito.\nAs\u00ed, ha elegido a algunos de los part\u00edcipes de la maniobra delictiva, involucrando directamente a -cuanto menos- uno de sus ministros y a un legislador nacional; ha controlado la evoluci\u00f3n del plan en cada paso; ha negociado por interp\u00f3sitas personas con uno de los pr\u00f3fugos; y se ha involucrado personalmente en algunas acciones de ocultamiento que este sofisticado plan requer\u00eda.\nEn la misma l\u00ednea, se demostrar\u00e1 holgadamente que el Ministro de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto de la Naci\u00f3n, H\u00e9ctor Timerman, ha sido - sin duda alguna- el principal instrumentador del plan de impunidad ideado y ordenado por la Sra. Presidente, Dra. Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez.\nNaturalmente, trat\u00e1ndose de un plan criminal que ha involucrado a un pa\u00eds extranjero, el Canciller ocupaba y ocupa el puesto clave para encargarse personalmente de muchos aspectos de este encubrimiento. Desde su funci\u00f3n, transmiti\u00f3 a Ir\u00e1n la decisi\u00f3n del gobierno argentino de abandonar el reclamo de justicia en la causa AMIA; acord\u00f3 la baja de las notificaciones rojas; sign\u00f3 acuerdos secretos con la parte iran\u00ed; particip\u00f3 de las negociaciones, de la redacci\u00f3n y de la firma del Memorando de Entendimiento, pieza central del plan de impunidad. Y se involucr\u00f3 personalmente en la campa\u00f1a de descr\u00e9dito y enga\u00f1o, destinada a destruir la credibilidad de la causa judicial con el fin de, dolosamente, presentar al acuerdo con Ir\u00e1n como la \u00fanica v\u00eda apta para solucionar el caso.\nAmbos funcionarios actuaron con un \u00fanico y delictivo prop\u00f3sito: lograr la impunidad definitiva de los acusados iran\u00edes y el cese de toda actividad jurisdiccional en su contra, en pos de restablecer plenas relaciones comerciales a nivel estatal y dar un paso hacia un acercamiento geopol\u00edtico con la Rep\u00fablica Isl\u00e1mica de Ir\u00e1n, sin soportar reproche alguno por parte de la sociedad argentina. Ello, seg\u00fan surge de la evidencia reunida y sin descartar en modo alguno la existencia de otros motivos adicionales a los aqu\u00ed expuestos, pero que en nada modificar\u00edan o disminuir\u00edan la criminal responsabilidad de los denunciados.\nQuiz\u00e1 no resulte ocioso aclarar que nada hay de reprochable en la relaci\u00f3n comercial o la vinculaci\u00f3n geopol\u00edtica entre estados. La objeci\u00f3n surge al comprobarse, n\u00edtidamente, que dicho acercamiento implic\u00f3 por parte de las autoridades del gobierno argentino aqu\u00ed denunciadas, sacrificar una causa judicial en tr\u00e1mite, desconocer lo decidido por la justicia nacional y urdir un plan criminal para borrar de un plumazo las serias acusaciones que pesan sobre los pr\u00f3fugos iran\u00edes, pretendiendo otorgarles impunidad definitiva. Algo in\u00e9dito y nunca visto.\nNo se trata de una afirmaci\u00f3n dogm\u00e1tica, se aportan en esta denuncia m\u00faltiples elementos probatorios que confirman que el anhelo por el petr\u00f3leo iran\u00ed fue uno de los motores de las acciones delictivas denunciadas. A modo de ejemplo puede citarse una m\u00ednima parte de la prueba descripta en este escrito, como cuando Femando Esteche, en diciembre de 2012, expres\u00f3 refiri\u00e9ndose al gobierno argentino: \u201c...los tipos quieren restablecer relaciones entre los dos estados... o cuando Luis D\u2019El\u00eda, en mayo de 2013, agreg\u00f3: \u201c...ah\u00ed habl\u00e9 con Julio  ...ac\u00e1 hay urgencia energ\u00e9tica...ellos est\u00e1n dispuestos a mandar a la gente de YPF a hacer negocios all\u00e1 [en alusi\u00f3n a Ir\u00e1n '[...est\u00e1 muy interesado en cambiar lo de aquellos por granos y carne...\u201d o, por \u00faltimo, cuando el agente iran\u00ed en Buenos Aires, Jorge \u201cYussuf\u2019 Khalil, confirm\u00f3 \u201c...el tema que necesita Argentina, es petr\u00f3leo...hay un verdadero inter\u00e9s para empezar y entablar las relaciones comerciales de gobierno a gobierno, con funcionarios del gobierno de ac\u00e1, una delegaci\u00f3n de all\u00e1 viajar\u00eda o a Caracas o al Golfo o a Beirut mejor ...para empezar las relaciones directas de funcionarios a funcionarios... \u201d.\nPor si ello no bastara, y aqu\u00ed lo relevante, otras pruebas vienen a confirmar que el comienzo del intercambio comercial argentino-iran\u00ed estaba supeditado a la ratificaci\u00f3n de Ir\u00e1n del Memorando de Entendimiento, es decir, al avance del plan de impunidad. Viene al caso destacar lo dicho por Jorge Khalil, uno de los part\u00edcipes de dicho plan: \u201cAc\u00e1 hay luz verde para hacer las operaciones...el tema es que quieren que se apure el memor\u00e1ndum...y se habl\u00f3 con De Vido...Argentina tiene una gran necesidad de petr\u00f3leo e Ir\u00e1n tiene una gran necesidad de granos... Por otro lado, De Vido entiende que para dar un paso en esto, o sea oficial, de Estado a Estado, tiene que haber firma del Memor\u00e1ndum\nY para sorpresa e indignaci\u00f3n de muchos, quedar\u00e1 evidenciado por la prueba reunida que en estas negociaciones particip\u00f3 nada menos que uno de los pr\u00f3fugos iran\u00edes, Mohsen Rabbani, quien recib\u00eda peri\u00f3dicos reportes telef\u00f3nicos de los avances que ocurr\u00edan en el seno de nuestro gobierno. Para citar otro ejemplo de los tantos que constan en esta presentaci\u00f3n, se transcribe uno de los informes telef\u00f3nicos recibidos por Rabbani: \u201c...hoy terminamos una reuni\u00f3n con el Ministro de Planificaci\u00f3n De Vido, en donde \u00e9l est\u00e1 dispuesto a mandar a las m\u00e1ximas autoridades de YPF para arreglar con la Rep\u00fablica Isl\u00e1mica y la transacci\u00f3n puede ser a trav\u00e9s de granos y a trav\u00e9s de otras cosas... \u201d, a lo que Rabbani contest\u00f3: \u201cm\u00e1ndeme para que eval\u00fae\u201d y luego de evaluarlo respondi\u00f3: \u201c...aqu\u00ed hay algunos sectores del gobierno que me dijeron que est\u00e1n listos para vender petr\u00f3leo a la Argentina...y tambi\u00e9n comprar armas... \u201d\nEs decir, mientras la justicia nacional acusaba y acusa fundadamente a ciertos funcionarios iran\u00edes de haber decidido, planificado y ejecutado el atentado terrorista contra la sede de la AMIA y mientras p\u00fablicamente la Sra. Presidente y el Sr. Canciller aseguraban que sus acciones estaban exclusivamente motivadas en la b\u00fasqueda de justicia para la causa AMIA y que el Memorando de Entendimiento era \u00fanica soluci\u00f3n viable para el caso, uno de esos imputados, Mohsen Rabbani, secreta y clandestinamente negociaba con nuestras autoridades a trav\u00e9s de intermediarios y canales ocultos, un intercambio de petr\u00f3leo por granos, la venta de armamento, y lo que es m\u00e1s grave a\u00fan: su impunidad.\nAcaso resulte una obviedad pero no puede dejar de se\u00f1alarse que las circunstancias denunciadas revisten una gravedad institucional extrema e inusitada, tanto por la jerarqu\u00eda funcional de varios de los involucrados en la maniobra criminal como por la calificaci\u00f3n legal del delito que se encubre, esto es, el \u201cdelito anterior\u201d objeto del encubrimiento, que es, ni m\u00e1s ni menos, que el atentado terrorista a la sede de la AMIA, judicialmente declarado crimen de lesa humanidad y calificado de genocidio por el juez de la causa, Dr. Rodolfo Canicoba Corral.\nAhora bien, para contextualizar debidamente los hechos delictivos que se denuncian, resulta \u00fatil recordar que la justicia argentina determin\u00f3 que las m\u00e1ximas autoridades iran\u00edes de 1994 fueron quienes tomaron la decisi\u00f3n de atentar contra la AMIA, diagramaron la implementaci\u00f3n de ese ataque y encomendaron su ejecuci\u00f3n a la organizaci\u00f3n terrorista libanesa Hezbollah.\nA consecuencia de ello se solicit\u00f3 la captura nacional e internacional del ex Presidente de la Rep\u00fablica Isl\u00e1mica de Ir\u00e1n, Ali Akbar Hashemi Bahramaie Rafsanjani; del ex Ministro de Relaciones Exteriores, Ali Akbar Velayati; del ex Ministro de Inteligencia, Ali Fallahijan; del ex Jefe de la Guardia Revolucionaria, Mohsen Rezai; del ex Jefe de la Fuerza Al Quds y ex Ministro de Defensa, Ahmad Vahidi; del Ex Agregado Cultural de la Embajada iran\u00ed en Argentina, Mohsen Rabbani; del ex Tercer Secretario de la Embajada de Ir\u00e1n en Argentina, Ahmad Reza Asghari y del ex Embajador de la Rep\u00fablica de Ir\u00e1n en nuestro pa\u00eds, Hadi Soleimpanpour. Desde el a\u00f1o 2007, sobre cinco de tales imputados: Fallahijan, Rezai, Vahidi, Rabbani y Asghari pesan notificaciones rojas, es decir, la m\u00e1xima prioridad de b\u00fasqueda que registra Interpol.\nCon apoyatura en tales imputaciones, la Rep\u00fablica Argentina ha venido reclamando por a\u00f1os a la Rep\u00fablica Isl\u00e1mica de Ir\u00e1n -hasta el momento, infructuosamente- la detenci\u00f3n con fines de extradici\u00f3n de los acusados iran\u00edes.\nEn efecto, durante su presidencia, N\u00e9stor Kirchner no solo llev\u00f3 el caso a la Asamblea General de la Organizaci\u00f3n de Naciones Unidas, sino que rechaz\u00f3 rotundamente todos los ofrecimientos de Teher\u00e1n, siempre destinados a acordar una salida pol\u00edticamente negociada a esta cuesti\u00f3n, netamente judicial. Da cuenta esta presentaci\u00f3n de voluminosa prueba documental y de varios testimonios coincidentes -del ex Jefe de Gabinete, Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez; de los ex Cancilleres, Rafael Bielsa y Jorge Taiana y del ex Vice Canciller, Roberto Garc\u00eda Morit\u00e1n- que describen los pactos propuestos por Ir\u00e1n y su rechazo de plano por parte del ex presidente argentino.\nEsa consistencia que durante a\u00f1os tuvo la postura oficial argentina en torno al caso AMIA, sufri\u00f3 un cambio radical a partir de la decisi\u00f3n de la actual Presidente de avanzar en un plan encubridor que permita a los imputados iran\u00edes eludir y sustraerse definitivamente al accionar de la justicia a efectos de facilitar, entre otros fines, un intercambio comercial a nivel estatal con la Rep\u00fablica Isl\u00e1mica de Ir\u00e1n. Dando cuenta de ello, el ex canciller Bielsa resalt\u00f3 el cambio de posici\u00f3n del gobierno de la Dra. Fern\u00e1ndez cuando sostuvo: ule dice a los familiares que los que comercian son las empresas y no el Estado. Me parece un argumento pelotudo, me fastidia mucho porque era un tema sagrado para N\u00e9stor ....Cuando era canciller, hablar de venderle o comprarle a Ir\u00e1n era casus belli \u201d.\nAs\u00ed las cosas, por mucho tiempo la relaci\u00f3n bilateral estuvo signada por la indiferencia iran\u00ed a los reclamos argentinos y, como contrapartida, por la s\u00f3lida resoluci\u00f3n de nuestro pa\u00eds de no avanzar en ning\u00fan frente vincular sin antes obtener cooperaci\u00f3n por parte de Teher\u00e1n, es decir, la entrega de los acusados para su juzgamiento por la justicia nacional.\nSe comprobar\u00e1 que, en este contexto hist\u00f3rico y con el cuadro de situaci\u00f3n descripto, entre octubre de 2010 y enero de 2011, el\ngobierno argentino presidido por Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez experiment\u00f3 un giro de 180 grados en relaci\u00f3n a su consideraci\u00f3n del caso AMIA. Efectivamente, aquel enero de 2011, H\u00e9ctor Timerman viaj\u00f3 a la ciudad siria de Alepo y secretamente se reuni\u00f3 con su par iran\u00ed, Ali Akbar Salehi, a quien le hizo saber que las autoridades pol\u00edticas argentinas estaban dispuestas a renunciar a la investigaci\u00f3n del caso AMIA y a cualquier reclamo de cooperaci\u00f3n y justicia, con tal de provocar un acercamiento de orden geopol\u00edtico y restablecer plenas relaciones comerciales entre ambos estados.\nQuedar\u00e1 demostrado tambi\u00e9n que el Canciller Salehi tom\u00f3 nota de tal ofrecimiento y se lo comunic\u00f3 al entonces Presidente Ahmadinejad: \u201c...Argentina ya no est\u00e1 m\u00e1s interesada en resolver aquellos dos atentados...en cambio prefiere mejorar sus relaciones comerciales con Ir\u00e1n \u201d. Es la primera vez que un estado agredido implora a un estado agresor que firme un acuerdo por el cual les otorgar\u00e1 impunidad a los agresores.\nDe este modo, comenz\u00f3 un per\u00edodo de negociaci\u00f3n secreto entre los gobiernos de Argentina e Ir\u00e1n que se extendi\u00f3 hasta septiembre de 2012 y durante el cual, ambas partes realizaron gestos que, a la luz de la prueba recolectada posteriormente y analizados en forma conjunta, claramente han sido indicativos del acuerdo que, en esa \u00e9poca, se estaba incubando. Siempre a modo de ejemplo, dado el car\u00e1cter introductorio de estos p\u00e1rrafos, puede citarse que el gobierno argentino, en julio de 2011, calific\u00f3 de \u201cmuy positiva\u201d una misiva de la canciller\u00eda persa por la cual se ofrec\u00eda colaborar con la investigaci\u00f3n, curiosamente, en una nueva hip\u00f3tesis, distinta a la esgrimida por la justicia.\nAvanzadas dichas negociaciones secretas donde se gest\u00f3 el encubrimiento y el plan de impunidad de los iran\u00edes, en el mes de septiembre de 2012, Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner oficializ\u00f3 las reuniones, siendo que, p\u00fablicamente ante la Asamblea General de Naciones Unidas, adujo que la Rep\u00fablica Isl\u00e1mica de Ir\u00e1n hab\u00eda expresado su voluntad de negociar por el caso AMIA. Se entienden ahora los motivos por los cuales la Sra. Presidente, en aquella oportunidad y por primera vez, no invit\u00f3 a las instituciones comunitarias jud\u00edas a formar parte de su comitiva a la apertura del Debate General de la citada asamblea internacional. El anuncio que har\u00eda hab\u00eda sido acordado con anterioridad y con una finalidad distinta a la que se invoc\u00f3.\nQuedar\u00e1 aqu\u00ed probado, que tal manifestaci\u00f3n de la Sra. Presidente fue solo una puesta en escena, la primera de muchas que ocurrir\u00edan durante el camino que recorri\u00f3 el plan de impunidad ideado y orquestado por los funcionarios argentinos aqu\u00ed denunciados. Con este gesto, se busc\u00f3 ocultar que el acercamiento hab\u00eda sido promovido por Argentina, y no por Ir\u00e1n como se dijo; y se quiso hacer creer que las negociaciones se iniciar\u00edan entonces, cuando ya llevaban -al menos- un a\u00f1o y medio.\nAs\u00ed, se acreditar\u00e1 que mientras transcurr\u00edan las negociaciones diplom\u00e1ticas p\u00fablicas, el plan de impunidad avanzaba solapadamente a trav\u00e9s de canales paralelos de comunicaci\u00f3n y negociaci\u00f3n con Ir\u00e1n, gest\u00e1ndose en aquel momento un aspecto fundamental del plan criminal: la desviaci\u00f3n de la investigaci\u00f3n hacia una nueva y falsa hip\u00f3tesis que incrimine a terceros inocentes, pero -fundamentalmente- desincrimine a los iran\u00edes, tareas de las participaron activamente Jorge Khalil, Fernando Esteche, H\u00e9ctor Yrimia y el sujeto conocido como \u201cAlian\u201d.\nEl resultado visible de las negociaciones, tanto secretas como p\u00fablicas, fue el Memorando de Entendimiento firmado el 27 de enero de 2013 en Etiop\u00eda. La versi\u00f3n oficial argentina indic\u00f3 que se trataba de un instrumento jur\u00eddico que permitir\u00eda avanzar con las indagatorias de los pr\u00f3fugos. La realidad fue que solo se trat\u00f3 de uno de los medios elegidos por las partes para viabilizar el plan criminal que negociaron durante dos a\u00f1os, pues su letra resultaba y resulta funcional a esta maniobra espuria.\nQue quede bien claro. El acuerdo entre representantes iran\u00edes y las autoridades argentinas excede con creces la mera letra del memorando. El plan criminal consisti\u00f3 en la eliminaci\u00f3n de las imputaciones que la justicia argentina esgrimi\u00f3 contra funcionarios iran\u00edes y el mejor modo que se hall\u00f3 para despejar tales acusaciones, brindar impunidad y presentar el\ntema de la manera m\u00e1s prolija posible a los ojos de la ciudadan\u00eda enga\u00f1ada, fue la suscripci\u00f3n del mencionado acuerdo bilateral.\nEllo fue as\u00ed porque su letra prev\u00e9 mecanismos para lograr la baja de las notificaciones rojas de Interpol, porque su aplicaci\u00f3n contiene tantas etapas sucesivas sin plazo alguno que permite prolongar indefinidamente su vigencia en el tiempo sin lograr avances reales, porque las conclusiones de la \u201cComisi\u00f3n de la Verdad\u201d ya estaban arregladas de antemano y su actuaci\u00f3n permite la introducci\u00f3n de la nueva hip\u00f3tesis falsa, armada con pruebas inventadas.\nEn efecto, como se ver\u00e1, en la pr\u00e1ctica, las \u00fanicas trabas a la impunidad de hecho de la que gozan los acusados iran\u00edes han sido las notificaciones rojas de Interpol, que tienen la capacidad de dificultar su movilidad trasnacional. Por ello, las partes acordaron hacerlas cesar. De all\u00ed que el punto 7 del Memorando tenga su raz\u00f3n de ser. Tr\u00e1tase del \u00fanico punto que deb\u00eda tener aplicaci\u00f3n inmediata, del \u00fanico que tiene car\u00e1cter operativo sin necesidad de que el acuerdo haya sido ratificado. Redactado en esos t\u00e9rminos, carece de toda explicaci\u00f3n l\u00f3gica. Se advierte, entonces, que la baja de las notificaciones rojas fue el primer y trascendental paso acordado secretamente entre Salehi y Timerman hacia la desvinculaci\u00f3n definitiva de los imputados.\nN\u00f3tese que, al mes de haberse firmado el Memorando de Entendimiento, el agente de inteligencia de Presidencia de la Naci\u00f3n \u201cAlian\u201d le comunic\u00f3 al operador iran\u00ed Khalil, \u201cTengo un chisme...me dijeron ah\u00ed en 'la casa' ...Interpol va a levantar el pedido de capturas de los amigos ...lo va a levantar ahora\u201d.\nEn forma sorpresiva e inesperada para los encubridores, Interpol advirti\u00f3 que se lo quiso involucrar donde nada ten\u00eda que hacer e intercedi\u00f3 a tiempo para evitar la baja de las prioridades de b\u00fasqueda. Se ver\u00e1 c\u00f3mo esa intervenci\u00f3n se erigi\u00f3 en un obst\u00e1culo inesperado para los autores del encubrimiento. Timerman no pudo cumplir lo que hab\u00eda prometido en sus negociaciones secretas con Ir\u00e1n, circunstancia que motiv\u00f3 la queja de los iran\u00edes. Rep\u00e1rese, adem\u00e1s, que desde que Interpol comunic\u00f3 que las notificaciones rojas contra los acusados por el caso AMIA seguir\u00edan vigentes, la Rep\u00fablica Isl\u00e1mica de Ir\u00e1n retir\u00f3 el acuerdo de su agenda parlamentaria y hasta el momento en que se formula esta presentaci\u00f3n, no ha comunicado oficialmente su aprobaci\u00f3n interna.\nEl motivo de semejante vuelta atr\u00e1s surge n\u00edtido de las pruebas que se presentar\u00e1n. El agente persa Khalil, al d\u00eda siguiente de regresar de Ir\u00e1n, comunic\u00f3 a las autoridades argentinas la raz\u00f3n de la tardanza, ante el reclamo local por la demora de Teher\u00e1n en la aprobaci\u00f3n interna de Memorando de Entendimiento: \u201c...De Vido tiene que saber que Timerman no cumpli\u00f3 con algunas cosas. Esto es as\u00ed de claro. No cumpli\u00f3 con algunas cosas...\u201d y en otra oportunidad, expres\u00f3: \u201c...meparece que el ruso este de mierda  se mand\u00f3 alguna...estaba firmado algo, donde estaba el tema de las cautelares ... \u201d.\nM\u00e1s all\u00e1 de los ejemplos relatados, lo que se pretende dejar aqu\u00ed en blanco sobre negro son dos conclusiones reveladoras que se desprenden de estos dichos, como de otras probanzas que tambi\u00e9n se analizar\u00e1n. La primera radica en la certidumbre sobre la existencia de una promesa por parte del canciller Timerman para dar de baja las notificaciones rojas. Timerman no cumpli\u00f3, no porque no haya querido, sino porque Interpol se lo impidi\u00f3. Incluso, podr\u00e1 apreciarse en esta denuncia que el Canciller volvi\u00f3 a la carga en los meses de septiembre y noviembre de 2013, con claras intenciones de convencer a Ronald Noble para que ceda y autorice el cese de las notificaciones rojas, bajo el argumento que el acuerdo entre las partes sigui\u00f3 avanzando, pero -por fortuna- tampoco entonces pudo lograr su cometido.\nLa segunda conclusi\u00f3n que se desprende de aquella conversaci\u00f3n transmite la certeza de que, adem\u00e1s del Memorando de Entendimiento firmado, han existido entre las partes otros acuerdos secretos. Corrobora tal afirmaci\u00f3n, entre otras evidencias, el testimonio del propio Salehi, quien reconoci\u00f3 sin ambages: \u201cInterpol debe eliminar las acusaciones contra las autoridades iran\u00edes ....El  del acuerdo entre Ir\u00e1n y Argentina en relaci\u00f3n con la cuesti\u00f3n AMIA ser\u00e1 hecho p\u00fablico en el momento adecuado y la cuesti\u00f3n  est\u00e1 incluida y nosotros la estamos siguiendo...\u201d. Habiendo sido realizada esta declaraci\u00f3n en el mes de marzo de 2013, resulta evidente que Salehi no se estaba refiriendo al Memorando de Entendimiento sino a otro convenio que a esa fecha a\u00fan no se hab\u00eda dado a conocer.\nY en este marco deben entenderse tambi\u00e9n las manifestaciones de Jorge \u201cYussuf\u2019 Khalil, cuando comentando noticias period\u00edsticas que difund\u00edan que el ex Ministro de Defensa iran\u00ed, Ahmad Vahidi, nunca ser\u00eda interrogado pese a estar incluido en el Memorando, asegur\u00f3 que el rumor era cierto, que ese tema en particular \u201cestaba conversado antes....estaba dentro del marco \u201d y que el acuerdo era \u201cm\u00e1s profundo todav\u00eda \u201d.\nEs decir, quedar\u00e1 probado que el Ministro de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto de la Naci\u00f3n, H\u00e9ctor Timerman no solo firm\u00f3 un Memorando de Entendimiento abiertamente inconstitucional, que adem\u00e1s garantiza la impunidad de los acusados iran\u00edes, sino que tambi\u00e9n cerr\u00f3 acuerdos secretos mucho m\u00e1s beneficiosos para los pr\u00f3fugos. De all\u00ed que se compruebe que no se trat\u00f3, como se present\u00f3 p\u00fablicamente, de dos partes que negociaron un acuerdo bilateral, sino que fueron dos socios que confeccionaron un sofisticado plan criminal de impunidad para desligar definitivamente a los pr\u00f3fugos de la causa AMIA de toda relaci\u00f3n con el atentado y cerrar toda investigaci\u00f3n respecto de ellos. De hecho, luego de suscribirse el acuerdo, el agente argentino \u201cAlian\u201d le confes\u00f3 a su par de Ir\u00e1n: \u201c...Tranquilo, ya ganamos, es decir, ganamos una partida, yo te dije, vos no me ten\u00edas fe...\u201d, dejando en evidencia que ambas partes han tenido el mismo objetivo criminal.\nAhora bien, surge de la evidencia detallada en la denuncia, que la oportuna intervenci\u00f3n de Interpol manteniendo vigentes las notificaciones rojas no frustr\u00f3 ni imposibilit\u00f3 a futuro el encubrimiento orquestado. Los autores hab\u00edan tenido la precauci\u00f3n de idear mecanismos\nalternativos para conseguir sus fines, contenidos en la letra del Memorando de Entendimiento.\nSe advertir\u00e1 sobre los numeros\u00edsimos mecanismos previstos en el intrincado acuerdo bilateral. Naturalmente ello no ha sido fruto de la incompetencia de los redactores sino, todo lo contrario, de su sagacidad para dotar al Memorando de un enmara\u00f1ado proceso de aplicaci\u00f3n que exige, para que un imputado iran\u00ed se siente a escuchar los cargos de la justicia argentina, la verificaci\u00f3n de una largu\u00edsima serie de procedimientos, alguno de ellos de imposible cumplimiento, atento a la incompatibilidad con sus respectivas legislaciones:\t1) que ambos pa\u00edses ratifiquen\ninternamente los t\u00e9rminos del acuerdo; 2) que se remitan mutuamente las notas reversales notificando dicha ratificaci\u00f3n; 3) que cada uno de los signatarios proceda a la elecci\u00f3n de personas de reconocida trayectoria jur\u00eddica y probidad personal para que integren la \u201cComisi\u00f3n de la Verdad\u201d; 4) que los elegidos acepten la designaci\u00f3n; 5) que entre ambas partes y de com\u00fan acuerdo, seleccionen un quinto miembro de la comisi\u00f3n; 6) que los miembros de la Comisi\u00f3n redacten las reglas del procedimiento al que se sujetar\u00e1n; 7) que se pida informaci\u00f3n de la causa; 8) que se env\u00ede la informaci\u00f3n requerida y se la traduzca; 9) que cada uno de los miembros de la comisi\u00f3n analice las pruebas remitidas; 10) que se re\u00fanan para emitir recomendaciones; 11) que se notifiquen dichas recomendaciones a los signatarios; 12) que se establezca una fecha para cumplir con audiencias; 13) que se cite a los imputados; 14) que \u00e9stos efectivamente comparezcan a un interrogatorio, que no re\u00fane -como se ver\u00e1- las condiciones m\u00ednimas para ser considerado una declaraci\u00f3n indagatoria v\u00e1lida para el derecho argentino. Ninguno de estos pasos tiene plazo determinado para ser cumplido. Tan es as\u00ed, que ha pasado m\u00e1s de un a\u00f1o y medio desde la firma del Memorando y todav\u00eda no se concluy\u00f3 siquiera el primer escal\u00f3n. Ir\u00e1n a\u00fan no ha comunicado la ratificaci\u00f3n del acuerdo. Puede verse con claridad que los t\u00e9rminos de este pacto, reflejo de una actividad criminal subyacente, est\u00e1n redactados de modo tal que muy sencillamente se puede demorar en forma indefinda su cumplimiento.\nOtra llave que conduce a la impunidad definitiva es la efectiva actuaci\u00f3n de la \u201cComisi\u00f3n de la Verdad\u201d cuya finalidad consiste en - llegado el momento- recibir y valorar nuevas pruebas y presentar una nueva hip\u00f3tesis sin iran\u00edes como acusados, legitimando el redireccionamiento de la pesquisa. La comisi\u00f3n evaluar\u00e1 una nueva verdad falsa, una verdad armada artificialmente por los inescrupulosos art\u00edfices de este siniestro plan. Nuevamente, prueba directa sostiene lo afirmado. El agente iran\u00ed Jorge Khalil, el mismo d\u00eda de la firma del Memorando, expres\u00f3: \u201c...alguien va a salir con la cara manchada de ac\u00e1...\u201d y ciertamente estaba seguro que no ser\u00eda el pa\u00eds al que sirve porque \u201c...Obvio, eso ya est\u00e1 arreglado... \u00bfC\u00f3mo va a ser para el lado nuestro, boludo? Si nosotros estamos sentados en la mesa... \u201d.\nEn ese sentido se demostrar\u00e1, con pruebas categ\u00f3ricas, que una vez firmado el Memorando de Entendimiento comenz\u00f3 una relaci\u00f3n de apoyo y protecci\u00f3n del gobierno argentino a los referentes iran\u00edes apostados en Buenos Aires que, conscientes de ello, afirmaron \u201cel gobierno ahora est\u00e1 a favor\"\\ \u201c...el gobierno banca...\u201d y el propio Khalil reconoci\u00f3: \u201c...Nosotros estamos ante un acuerdo con el gobierno nacional ...atr\u00e1s de una negociaci\u00f3n con el gobierno nacional...\u201d.\nEn otro pasaje de la denuncia quedar\u00e1 demostrado que autores y c\u00f3mplices, como parte integral del plan criminal, ya hab\u00edan planificado y avanzado en la fabricaci\u00f3n de una hip\u00f3tesis acusatoria falsa, con pruebas inventadas para redireccionar la pesquisa hacia terceros inocentes y as\u00ed desligar definitivamente a los nacionales iran\u00edes. En referencia a dicha desincriminaci\u00f3n fraudulenta, en una fecha tan temprana como diciembre de 2012, Esteche asever\u00f3: \u201cquieren construir un nuevo enemigo de la AMIA, el nuevo responsable de la AMIA, es una necesidad que tienen que construirla... Y de la conversaci\u00f3n se desprende que esa tarea qued\u00f3 a cargo de funcionarios de la Secretar\u00eda de Inteligencia, especialmente designados para ello.\nEs decir, en una \u00e9poca en que ni la justicia ni los familiares sab\u00edan qu\u00e9 estaba ocurriendo con la negociaci\u00f3n entre Argentina e Ir\u00e1n, los\npart\u00edcipes del encubrimiento conoc\u00edan perfectamente que se ven\u00eda un cambio de hip\u00f3tesis y el redireccionamiento de la investigaci\u00f3n hacia nuevos imputados. Esto era as\u00ed, pues ellos mismos eran justamente los encargados de armar la falsa acusaci\u00f3n.\nAs\u00ed se explican las palabras de \u201cAlian\u201d cuando afirm\u00f3 \u201c...estamos en otro pa\u00eds, es otra situaci\u00f3n mundial y hay que trabajar en otro contexto...''\u2019' y \u201c...va a venir otra hip\u00f3tesis con otras pruebas...\u201d que iban a descolocar al suscripto como Fiscal de la causa \u201cporque nunca las vio, \u00e9l, las pruebas ...lo que viene ahora\nSin importar las evidencias, los hechos o su verdadera responsabilidad en el atentado, los ciudadanos iran\u00edes iban a ser desvinculados de la causa, se le iba a \u201clavar la cara\u201d a Ir\u00e1n y ello estaba cerrado \u201cmuy arriba\u201d, es decir ten\u00eda el sello presidencial. Todo hab\u00eda sido acordado, se iba a utilizar el caso AMIA como una pieza para saciar intereses geopol\u00edticos en el nuevo tablero internacional.\nCasi con iron\u00eda, al suscribir el acuerdo, el canciller emiti\u00f3 un comunicado que rezaba: \u201c...El gobierno nacional ratifica que el \u00fanico compromiso es con las v\u00edctimas y el derecho de sus familiares a hallar en la verdad y en la justicia la reparaci\u00f3n debida. Argentina reafirma que en dicho objetivo no hay lugar para intereses geopol\u00edticos, ni propios, ni ajenos... \u201d. Las pruebas aqu\u00ed obtenidas revelan que esto no era cierto y que intereses comerciales y geopol\u00edticos motorizaron un plan secreto de impunidad, que nada tiene que ver con la b\u00fasqueda de justicia.\nPor otra parte, resulta oportuno destacar tambi\u00e9n la tranquilidad con que actuaron todos los part\u00edcipes del plan de impunidad, en particular el individuo conocido como \u201cAlian\u201d, que se ha venido desenvolviendo libremente sin considerar necesario actuar de modo encubierto, ni siquiera ante la extrema sensibilidad del asunto que llevaba adelante. Ello se ha debido simplemente a la circunstancia de que ha actuado por \u00f3rdenes superiores, por directivas expresas de la Presidente de la Naci\u00f3n, raz\u00f3n por la cual no ha tenido que preocuparse por camuflar sus actividades. \u201cAlian\u201d, en primera persona, confes\u00f3 esa m\u00e1xima garant\u00eda. La redirecci\u00f3n de la investigaci\u00f3n y el desprestigio de las autoridades judiciales a cargo de la investigaci\u00f3n ten\u00edan el sello presidencial \u201ctranquilo, est\u00e1 cerrado muy arriba\nAdem\u00e1s, conforme podr\u00e1 apreciarse con mayor claridad en el desarrollo de las p\u00e1ginas correspondientes, se ver\u00e1 que tanto la Sra. Presidente como su Canciller contribuyeron en forma personal al perfeccionamiento del plan criminal. Ambos se involucraron en una campa\u00f1a pol\u00edtica y medi\u00e1tica pretendiendo instalar, entre otras falsas cuestiones, la idea de que la causa por el atentado a la AMIA estaba paralizada pr\u00e1cticamente desde que se inici\u00f3.\nQuedar\u00e1 expuesto con sumo detalle el modo en que la Dra. Fern\u00e1ndez y el Sr. Timerman han manipulado a sobrevivientes, a familiares de las v\u00edctimas del atentado y a instituciones jud\u00edas comunitarias, desplegando una completa artiller\u00eda de mentiras, falacias y enga\u00f1os que tienen su ejemplo emblem\u00e1tico en la promesa presidencial, flagrantemente incumplida, que asegur\u00f3 una consulta con familiares y v\u00edctimas, previo a la aceptaci\u00f3n de cualquier propuesta por parte de Ir\u00e1n. Recu\u00e9rdese que, en septiembre de 2012, la primera mandataria expres\u00f3: \u201c...tengan la certeza de que esta Presidenta no va a tomar ninguna resoluci\u00f3n respecto de ninguna propuesta que le sea formulada, sin consultar PREVIAMENTE con quienes han sido las v\u00edctimas directas de esto. Y, al mismo tiempo tambi\u00e9n, con las fuerzas pol\u00edticas con representaci\u00f3n parlamentaria en mi pa\u00eds, porque esto no puede decidir una sola fuerza pol\u00edtica..\nLa realidad fue cruda. Se enga\u00f1\u00f3 a los familiares y a las v\u00edctimas del atentado ya que, contrario a lo prometido, jam\u00e1s se los consult\u00f3. Es m\u00e1s, debieron enterarse de la firma del Memorando de Entendimiento con la Rep\u00fablica Isl\u00e1mica de Ir\u00e1n por los medios de comunicaci\u00f3n. Tampoco fueron escuchados cuando expresaron mayoritariamente su rechazo a la ratificaci\u00f3n del acuerdo por parte del Congreso Nacional. Qued\u00f3 claro, entonces, que dijeran lo que dijeran los familiares la decisi\u00f3n estaba tomada. El Memorando hab\u00eda sido firmado para garantizar un objetivo oculto: dotar de impunidad a los acusados iran\u00edes y permitir al gobierno argentino justificar ante sus ciudadanos y la comunidad internacional el restablecimiento de las relaciones comerciales y el alineamiento con Teher\u00e1n. Por ello, el acuerdo deb\u00eda ser aprobado a cualquier costo, porque despejaba el \u00fanico escollo que exist\u00eda para asociarse con Ir\u00e1n. Era estrictamente necesario para la consecuci\u00f3n del plan criminal perge\u00f1ado.\nVaya iron\u00eda. Una Presidente que p\u00fablicamente se ha regodeado manifestando a los sobrevivientes y a los familiares de las v\u00edctimas su compromiso en la b\u00fasqueda de verdad y justicia, que ha declarado que su gobierno no permitir\u00e1 que se use el caso AMIA en el ajedrez de la geopol\u00edtica mundial, que ha tomado cartas en el asunto porque la causa estaba paralizada; fue, en realidad, la principal art\u00edfice, junto con el Canciller Timerman, de la fraudulenta desarticulaci\u00f3n de la investigaci\u00f3n y del encubrimiento de estos acusados. En el discurso se habl\u00f3 de justicia y verdad. En los hechos se acord\u00f3 impunidad. Pasmoso. Da pavor, entonces, constatar que todo se ha tratado de actuaci\u00f3n y manipulaci\u00f3n de hechos y personas y, m\u00e1s a\u00fan, de acciones delictivas.\nTambi\u00e9n se acreditar\u00e1 que la reuni\u00f3n del 28 de septiembre de\n2012\tentre los cancilleres de ambos pa\u00edses, fue una puesta en escena previamente pautada y, en realidad, gestada a pedido de Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez para enga\u00f1ar a la opini\u00f3n p\u00fablica argentina.\nMientras d\u00edas atr\u00e1s, la Presidente hab\u00eda exhortado con firmeza, ante la Asamblea General de las Naciones Unidas, al flamante presidente iran\u00ed Hassan Rohani para que avance con la implementaci\u00f3n del pacto; por lo bajo y a trav\u00e9s de los canales paralelos de negociaci\u00f3n que se desarrollaron para llevar adelante este plan criminal, la Dra. Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez entabl\u00f3 comunicaciones con altos mandos iran\u00edes y con el mismo Mohsen Rabbani. El mensajero argentino Luis D\u2019El\u00eda especific\u00f3 el pedido: \u201c...tengo un mensaje urgente del gobierno argentino, para pasar all\u00e1 urgente , antes de ma\u00f1ana...Estoy en la casa de gobierno ahora...no hay asunto m\u00e1s importante que este, cr\u00e9emelo ....necesito que hables con el Sheik de all\u00e1  mira que es muy groso lo que tengo eh!..\u201d. La Sra. Presidente buscaba obtener ciertos pronunciamientos p\u00fablicos por parte de Teher\u00e1n, aunque fueran falsos porque ser\u00edan funcionales al plan de impunidad, siempre con el objeto de avanzar en su objetivo \u00faltimo: el acercamiento comercial y geopol\u00edtico con Ir\u00e1n.\nEl receptor del mensaje de D\u2019El\u00eda y transmisor a Ir\u00e1n, Jorge Khalil, revel\u00f3 la informaci\u00f3n al expresar: \u201c...Necesitan que el gobierno iran\u00ed junto con el gobierno argentino ma\u00f1ana anuncie la conformaci\u00f3n de la Comisi\u00f3n de la Verdad...\u201d. As\u00ed se adelanta lo que quedar\u00e1 demostrado en este punto: el inter\u00e9s imperioso de los encubridores en realizar nuevos aportes al plan, la existencia de canales de comunicaci\u00f3n y negociaci\u00f3n paralelos a los oficiales y ocultos a la opini\u00f3n p\u00fablica, la evidencia flagrante de que los detalles sobre el plan criminal se arreglaron en secreto por tales canales y que las manifestaciones p\u00fablicas de la Presidente y el Canciller han sido solo maquillaje medi\u00e1tico para enga\u00f1ar a la ciudadan\u00eda respecto a la real situaci\u00f3n del caso AMIA.\nFinalmente, quedar\u00e1 demostrado que este sofisticado plan, como se expuso al inicio, fue ejecutado por un conjunto de c\u00f3mplices. En primer lugar, corresponde mencionar a Luis D\u2019El\u00eda, desde siempre un ac\u00e9rrimo defensor tanto del r\u00e9gimen iran\u00ed como del gobierno nacional, al punto de calificarse a s\u00ed mismo como \u201cun soldado\u201d incondicional de la Presidente: \u201c ...Yo tengo que hacer el juego de la Rosada...Si tengo orden de no ir, soy un soldado ac\u00e1...\u201d. Funcion\u00f3 como el interlocutor oculto de las autoridades gubernamentales argentinas y oper\u00f3 como transmisor y receptor de los mensajes clandestinos a la contraparte iran\u00ed, destinado a remover los obst\u00e1culos que iba presentando el avance del encubrimiento. Su voz ha sido la del gobierno nacional. Sus antecedentes lo avalaban para ocupar esa funci\u00f3n. Consustanciado ideol\u00f3gicamente con ambas partes del pacto delictivo, estuvo varias veces en Ir\u00e1n invitado por el r\u00e9gimen y en una ocasi\u00f3n, le ofrecieron un acuerdo similar al que luego firm\u00f3 Timerman, que ya inclu\u00eda el cese de las notificaciones rojas. En todas sus visitas a Ir\u00e1n, se entrevist\u00f3 con las m\u00e1ximas autoridades, se fotografi\u00f3 -entre otros- con el pr\u00f3fugo Mohsen Rabbani, con quien est\u00e1 relacionado hace a\u00f1os.\nJorge Alejandro \u201cYussuf\u2019 Khalil es el referente m\u00e1s importante de las autoridades del r\u00e9gimen iran\u00ed en Argentina, incluso por encima del ex Encargado de Negocios de Ir\u00e1n en nuestro pa\u00eds, sobre quien -como luego se ver\u00e1- ten\u00eda m\u00e1s poder. Militante a tiempo completo de los intereses persas, es la \u201cvoz y o\u00eddos de Ir\u00e1n\u201d en Argentina. En ese car\u00e1cter, ha funcionado como el nexo central en la vinculaci\u00f3n entre funcionarios iran\u00edes y argentinos en el marco de los hechos denunciados, operando -de ese modo- como el referente de la diplomacia paralela que comunica Buenos Aires con Teher\u00e1n, que fue aprovechada para la consecuci\u00f3n del plan de impunidad. Particip\u00f3 tanto del armado de la pista falsa, como de las tratativas con el gobierno argentino relativas a los intercambios comerciales que se pretend\u00edan establecer con Ir\u00e1n a nivel estatal. Y mantuvo constantemente informado de cada avance del plan al pr\u00f3fugo Mohsen Rabbani.\nFemando Esteche, es el l\u00edder de la agrupaci\u00f3n Quebracho, muy cercano a algunos funcionarios del gobierno nacional y que desde anta\u00f1o ha mantenido una postura favorable a los intereses iran\u00edes, tanto que ha sido sostenido econ\u00f3micamente por dicho r\u00e9gimen. Su intervenci\u00f3n ha sido determinante pues se trata de uno de los sujetos que viabiliz\u00f3 el avance del plan de encubrimiento, acercando al agente iran\u00ed Khalil a los funcionarios de inteligencia argentinos, y en especial, al ex Fiscal designado para actuar en la causa AMIA, H\u00e9ctor Yrimia, adem\u00e1s de haber aportado ideas concretas para la construcci\u00f3n de la nueva hip\u00f3tesis falsa.\nEl Diputado Nacional Andr\u00e9s Larroque tambi\u00e9n ha sido un actor clave en la articulaci\u00f3n del plan criminal pues, dada su cercan\u00eda tanto con la Presidente de la Naci\u00f3n como con los part\u00edcipes del encubrimiento ha operado como nexo e intermediario de la informaci\u00f3n transmitida entre autores y c\u00f3mplices del encubrimiento. Se probar\u00e1n distintos episodios en los que Larroque baj\u00f3 directivas presidenciales, tanto a Khalil como a D'El\u00eda, sobre c\u00f3mo deb\u00edan actuar. Como por ejemplo, la ocasi\u00f3n en que, en noviembre de 2012, Khalil reconoci\u00f3: \u201c...vengo de La Matanza reci\u00e9n he tenido una reuni\u00f3n con Luis D'El\u00eda y el \u201cCuervo\u201d Larroque, el de la C\u00e1mpora...que me llamaron temprano que quer\u00edan hablar conmigo, que ten\u00edan un mensaje para el gobierno para dar... Y ahora me voy para Mart\u00ednez a dar el mensaje, a la casa del Embajador...\u201d. Su intervenci\u00f3n ha resultado indispensable en la ingenier\u00eda criminal para evitar el contacto directo entre autores y ejecutores del plan de impunidad.\nEl Dr. H\u00e9ctor Yrimia, entonces Fiscal de Primera Instancia en lo Criminal y Correccional Federal, fue designado el d\u00eda del atentado junto a otros fiscales para actuar en forma conjunta, alterna o sucesiva en el caso AMIA. De all\u00ed que haya conocido en detalle los hechos materia de investigaci\u00f3n. En consecuencia, estuvo en contacto con pruebas, testimonios, peritajes e informes de la causa y -justamente- este minucioso grado de cognici\u00f3n lo ha tornado fundamental para el buen desarrollo del plan. Su aporte fue realizado donde result\u00f3 m\u00e1s \u00fatil: en el armado de una hip\u00f3tesis falsa donde, vali\u00e9ndose de la informaci\u00f3n obtenida en ejercicio de la funci\u00f3n p\u00fablica, ha cooperado con dicha fase del plan.\nUna menci\u00f3n aparte merece el sujeto conocido como \u201cAlian\u201d, que responde a la Secretar\u00eda de Inteligencia de Presidencia de la Naci\u00f3n. Se trata de una persona con acceso al entorno presidencial, que cuenta con informaci\u00f3n privilegiada -incluso sobre la salud de la Sra. Presidente- y que ha declarado su simpat\u00eda con el r\u00e9gimen iran\u00ed, que ha actuado -en reiteradas ocasiones- a favor de intereses extranjeros en detrimento de los nacionales. Que ha transmitido informaciones secretas y protegidas por la ley de inteligencia a agentes de una potencia extranjera y en quien la Sra. Presidente ha confiado para llevar adelante parte del plan de impunidad por su dedicaci\u00f3n, obediencia, pero -sobre todo- por su falta de escr\u00fapulos a la hora de manipular pruebas y personas para la consecuci\u00f3n del designio ilegal que le fuera encomendado por su jefa.\nEfectivamente, quedar\u00e1 ampliamente explicado y comprobado, que los part\u00edcipes del encubrimiento, en especial el nombrado \u201cAlian\u201d, junto al ex Fiscal designado para actuar en la causa AMIA y ex Juez de Instrucci\u00f3n, Dr. H\u00e9ctor Yrimia, han trabajado y negociado la impunidad de los pr\u00f3fugos de la causa AMIA, transmitiendo para ello informaci\u00f3n sensible y clasificada a la contraparte iran\u00ed, contribuyendo al armado de una pista falsa, con pruebas inventadas, conspirando contra la investigaci\u00f3n judicial e incluso utilizando los resortes del Estado Nacional para allanar cualquier obst\u00e1culo que surgiera durante la ejecuci\u00f3n del plan de encubrimiento.\nEn fin, los hechos que aqu\u00ed se relataron, en brev\u00edsima s\u00edntesis, constituyen la concreci\u00f3n de un sofisticado plan de encubrimiento para dotar de impunidad a los acusados iran\u00edes por la causa AMIA, que fue decidido por la Sra. Presidente Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez, e instrumentado - principalmente- por su canciller H\u00e9ctor Timerman, con la colaboraci\u00f3n de personajes que, por sus cualidades y conocimientos, resultaron ideales para llevar a cabo la maniobra criminal.\nLa parad\u00f3jica y por cierto irritante circunstancia de este entramado delictivo fue que los autores del plan, para lograr sus objetivos criminales, al mismo tiempo que clamaban p\u00fablicamente que solo buscaban verdad y justicia, no trepidaron en buscar destruir la imputaci\u00f3n de la justicia argentina a expensas de 85 muertes.\nI.\t- Aclaraci\u00f3n previa sobre la prueba:\nLos elementos probatorios que sirven de sustento para radicar la presente denuncia son, algunos de ellos, de acceso p\u00fablico. Sin embargo, otros, han llegado a conocimiento del suscripto en el ejercicio de su funci\u00f3n y en el marco de la investigaci\u00f3n del atentado perpetrado contra la sede de la AMIA. Se tratan, estos \u00faltimos, del producto de intervenciones telef\u00f3nicas dispuestas judicialmente en la causa AMIA, con anterioridad incluso al comienzo de las negociaciones espurias.\nInicialmente, siempre en el marco de la pesquisa por el atentado, pruebas, indicios y circunstancias fueron hallados o conocidos en\nforma aislada, independientes unos de otros, de forma tal que nada revelaban respecto del sustrato delictivo que, hoy ya se advierte, tienen en com\u00fan. Sin embargo, el paso del tiempo y -fundamentalmente- la aparici\u00f3n de nuevos elementos, insoslayables por la criminalidad que exponen, hicieron que cobrara forma y solidez la sospecha sobre la existencia del plan delictivo aqu\u00ed acreditado, toda vez que las evidencias obtenidas, observadas integralmente, permiten revelar una grav\u00edsima actividad delictiva.\nLas graves irregularidades y delitos que fueron surgiendo de las intervenciones telef\u00f3nicas analizadas se tornaron cada vez m\u00e1s evidentes. Qued\u00f3 claro que las conversaciones mantenidas por los imputados ten\u00edan su correspondiente correlato en la realidad. Los part\u00edcipes anticipaban lo que iba ocurriendo.\nAs\u00ed comenz\u00f3 a develarse el entramado criminal que aqu\u00ed se denuncia y muchas de las dudas que surg\u00edan de la actuaci\u00f3n del gobierno argentino, por ejemplo, los t\u00e9rminos en que hab\u00eda sido redactado y firmado el Memorando de Entendimiento, encontraron su explicaci\u00f3n en el producido de las escuchas judiciales.\nTal como un rompecabezas que va adquiriendo forma al colocarle nuevas piezas, el plan de encubrimiento fue hallando su foco, las fases del \u201citer criminis\u201d fueron torn\u00e1ndose m\u00e1s n\u00edtidas y fue posible desentra\u00f1ar, al menos, una parte de esta sofisticada maniobra.\nNo debe caerse en la simplificaci\u00f3n o la ingenuidad de que esta presentaci\u00f3n abarca todos los elementos del plan criminal de impunidad. En rigor de verdad, lo que se vislumbra, por grave que sea, resulta ser -apenas- la punta del iceberg. Al respecto, se advierte que los aspectos m\u00e1s delicados de la planificaci\u00f3n del delito no fueron comentados v\u00eda telef\u00f3nica sino convenidos personalmente, por lo que la r\u00e1pida actividad jurisdiccional para reconstruir hist\u00f3ricamente lo sucedido, resulta, en este caso, fundamental.\nEn consecuencia, corresponde afirmar que lo denunciado, ya de una gravedad institucional inusitada, es tan solo una peque\u00f1a parte de la trama y de las conductas il\u00edcitas llevadas adelante. Ser\u00e1 el Magistrado instructor quien deber\u00e1 determinar hasta d\u00f3nde se extiende en su real dimensi\u00f3n este plan de encubrimiento e impunidad.\nPor otra parte, cabe destacar que circunstancias y referencias que surgen de las comunicaciones registradas han podido ser corroboradas, ya sea porque tomaron estado p\u00fablico o bien, porque se condicen con hechos o manifestaciones posteriores que tambi\u00e9n han trascendido al conocimiento de todos. En otras palabras, referencias, circunstancias, fechas, episodios, posicionamientos pol\u00edticos, es decir, un conjunto heterog\u00e9neo de cuestiones mencionadas en los intercambios telef\u00f3nicos que aqu\u00ed se reproducen, han tenido correlato en la realidad y ello redunda en la verosimilitud de las conversaciones registradas.\nLos ejemplos son numeros\u00edsimos. Entre muchas otras referencias, que se ven constatadas en hechos de p\u00fablico conocimiento, se hacen menciones y comentarios sobre:\n-\tla firma del Memorando de Entendimiento (Comunicaciones del 27/1/13, abonado N\u00b011-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2013-01 -27- 112032-4, CD 266; Archivo B-1009-2013-01-27-112552-12, CD 266; Archivo B-1009-2013-01-27-113208-14, CD 266; Archivo B-1009-2013-01-27-122441-28, CD 266; Archivo B-l 009-2013- 01-27-174637-12, CD 266);\n-\tlos discursos de los senadores nacionales (Comunicaciones del 13/2/13, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-l009-2013-02-13- 123827-24, CD 283; Comunicaci\u00f3n del 13/02/2013, abonado - 3315-6908, Archivo B-l009-2013-02-13-184206-28, CD 283) y de los diputados nacionales (Comunicaciones del 26/2/13, abonado 1 1-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2013-02-26-180341 - 24.wav, CD 296) durante el debate parlamentario;\n-\tel viaje de la Dra.

El hecho provoc\u00f3 la muerte de ochenta y cinco personas, lesiones de distinta gravedad en al menos ciento cincuenta y una, y cuantiosos da\u00f1os materiales.\nSin perjuicio de lo ocurrido en los primeros a\u00f1os de la pesquisa, con fecha 25 de octubre de 2006, el suscripto emiti\u00f3 un dictamen en el que se acus\u00f3 a un ciudadano liban\u00e9s y a siete ciudadanos iran\u00edes, - todos ellos, altos funcionarios del entonces gobierno persa-, por su participaci\u00f3n en el atentado del 18 de julio de 1994 (fs. 122.333/122.738 de los autos principales ).\nEl 9 de noviembre de 2006, el Sr. Juez de la causa, Dr. Rodolfo Canicoba Corral, dispuso librar \u00f3rdenes de captura nacional e internacional para dar con nueve imputados (un liban\u00e9s y ocho iran\u00edes)\u201c, con miras a su extradici\u00f3n y a fin de recibirles declaraci\u00f3n indagatoria en la causa (fs. 122.775/122.800).\nConsecuentemente, INTERPOL Buenos Aires confeccion\u00f3 y remiti\u00f3 a sus similares las correspondientes notificaciones rojas. Por su parte, la justicia argentina, al comprobar que los sujetos buscados no hab\u00edan comparecido, el Io de diciembre de 2006, los declar\u00f3 rebeldes.\nLas \u00f3rdenes de captura dictadas por el juez Canicoba Corral a instancias de esta Fiscal\u00eda, fueron cuestionadas por la Oficina Central Nacional Teher\u00e1n (OCN Teher\u00e1n). La Secretar\u00eda General de INTERPOL invit\u00f3 a las partes a una reuni\u00f3n programada para el mes de enero de 2007. El 22 de aquel mes la delegaci\u00f3n argentina, encabezada por el suscripto, realiz\u00f3 una presentaci\u00f3n ante dicha Secretar\u00eda General en la cual expuso pormenorizada y detalladamente las razones y argumentos que justificaban una nueva inscripci\u00f3n de las notificaciones rojas relativas a las \u00f3rdenes de captura internacional dispuestas en la causa.\nPuntualmente se explic\u00f3 que los nuevos pedidos de captura estaban fundados en una decisi\u00f3n judicial de un estado soberano, basados en nuevas probanzas y que respetaban los requisitos fijados por INTERPOL para la inscripci\u00f3n de medidas de tal naturaleza, exhortando a las autoridades de la organizaci\u00f3n a que, en forma inmediata, dispusieran la b\u00fasqueda y detenci\u00f3n de quienes se encontraban sospechados de haber tenido participaci\u00f3n en el mayor atentado terrorista en la historia de nuestro pa\u00eds.\nLa Secretar\u00eda General de INTERPOL, tras escuchar tambi\u00e9n los argumentos de la delegaci\u00f3n iran\u00ed, dispuso que el asunto fuera tratado por el Comit\u00e9 Ejecutivo del organismo a la vez que encomend\u00f3 a la Oficina de Asuntos Legales la confecci\u00f3n de un dictamen sobre la cuesti\u00f3n debatida.\nDicha oficina efectu\u00f3 una saludable distinci\u00f3n entre las solicitudes de detenci\u00f3n de ciudadanos iran\u00edes formuladas por el ex juez Galeano (a las que denomin\u00f3 AMIA I) y las \u00f3rdenes de capturas libradas en noviembre de 2006 por el Dr. Canicoba Corral (a las que llam\u00f3 AMIA II) recomendando que, sobre cinco de las ocho personas acusadas, se acceda a la solicitud de publicar las notificaciones rojas.\nLa situaci\u00f3n de quienes, al momento del hecho, desempe\u00f1aban los cargos de Presidente y Ministro de Relaciones Exteriores de la Rep\u00fablica Isl\u00e1mica de Ir\u00e1n, fue considerada similar a la analizada por el Tribunal Internacional de Justicia en el caso: \u201cRep\u00fablica Democr\u00e1tica del\nCongo vs. B\u00e9lgica\u201d y las notificaciones rojas quedaron excluidas. Tampoco se emiti\u00f3 notificaci\u00f3n roja respecto del exembajador iran\u00ed en Argentina, Hadi Soleimanpour.\nAdem\u00e1s, sobre la presentaci\u00f3n que formul\u00f3 el suscripto en la sede de INTERPOL, su Secretario General, Sr. Ronald Noble, sostuvo: \u201c...la altamente profesional explicaci\u00f3n de su caso, acusado por acusado, proporcionada por los fiscales argentinos que intervienen en la causa fue importante en la conclusi\u00f3n de la Oficina de Asuntos Jur\u00eddicos de que el caso del pedido de \u00a1as notificaciones rojas por parte de la OCN Buenos Aires no revest\u00eda un car\u00e1cter pol\u00edtico predominante como para que entrara en vigor la prohibici\u00f3n del art\u00edculo 3.. \u201d\nEn el mes de marzo de 2007 tuvo lugar la reuni\u00f3n del Comit\u00e9 Ejecutivo del INTERPOL que deb\u00eda decidir esta materia (Sud\u00e1frica, Chile, Singapur, Italia, Argelia, Estados Unidos, Corea, Espa\u00f1a, Marruecos, Brasil, India, Rusia y Alemania). Nuevamente una delegaci\u00f3n argentina viaj\u00f3 a la ciudad de Lyon, Rep\u00fablica de Francia. El d\u00eda 14 de ese mes, quien firma \u00e9sta presentaci\u00f3n expuso su postura ante los miembros del Comit\u00e9 Ejecutivo reunidos a tal efecto en la sede central de INTERPOL. Finalizado el alegato, algunos miembros formularon consultas relativas al caso, que fueron respondidas. Seguidamente la delegaci\u00f3n iran\u00ed hizo lo propio.\nFinalmente, ambas delegaciones fueron convocadas a la sala de sesiones donde el se\u00f1or Presidente del Comit\u00e9 Ejecutivo anunci\u00f3 que, tras realizar un cuidadoso estudio de las presentaciones tanto escritas como orales, efectuadas por ambas delegaciones, se lleg\u00f3 a una decisi\u00f3n un\u00e1nime, consistente en ratificar y hacer suya la recomendaci\u00f3n efectuada por el se\u00f1or Secretario General de la Organizaci\u00f3n tras la reuni\u00f3n del 22 de enero de 2007, y en consecuencia, disponer la publicaci\u00f3n de las notificaciones rojas respecto de Imad Fayez Moughnieh, Ali Fallahijan, Mohsen Rabbani, Ahmad Asghari, Ahmad Vahidi y Mohsen Rezai y rechazar la solicitud de Ali Rafsanjani, Ali Velayati y Hadi Soleimapour (\u00e9ste \u00faltimo s\u00f3lo solicitado por el Sr. Juez Canicoba Corral).\nSe inform\u00f3 adem\u00e1s que la inscripci\u00f3n de las notificaciones rojas ordenadas por el Comit\u00e9 Ejecutivo tendr\u00eda lugar a partir del 31 de marzo de 2007, salvo que mediara recurso de apelaci\u00f3n por parte de alguna de las OCN involucradas en la controversia, en cuyo caso el asunto ser\u00eda remitido a consideraci\u00f3n de la Asamblea General de la organizaci\u00f3n que se reunir\u00eda en el Reino de Marruecos en el mes de noviembre de 2007.\nEl 22 de marzo de 2007 esta Unidad Fiscal fue notificada que la OCN Teher\u00e1n hab\u00eda formalmente apelado la decisi\u00f3n del Comit\u00e9 Ejecutivo solicitando que la cuesti\u00f3n fuera planteada ante la Asamblea General, lo que recibi\u00f3 acogida favorable por parte de las autoridades del organismo policial internacional, incluyendo este asunto en el orden del d\u00eda de la aludida reuni\u00f3n de referida asamblea.\nComo en las anteriores ocasiones, se entendi\u00f3 conveniente la asistencia del titular y el coordinador general de la Unidad Fiscal, as\u00ed como integrantes de la OCN Buenos Aires, a la 76a Reuni\u00f3n Anual de la Asamblea General de INTERPOL celebrada en la ciudad de Marrakech, Reino de Marruecos, donde se decidir\u00eda el curso de cinco nuevas notificaciones rojas ordenadas en estas actuaciones.\nEl 16 de octubre de 2007 se recibi\u00f3 la comunicaci\u00f3n, por parte de la Secretar\u00eda General del Organismo Internacional de Polic\u00eda, del orden del d\u00eda a tratarse durante la reuni\u00f3n anual. El punto 8 c) ten\u00eda previsto resolver el litigio entre Ir\u00e1n y Argentina por la publicaci\u00f3n de notificaciones rojas, en raz\u00f3n del recurso presentado por la Rep\u00fablica Isl\u00e1mica contra la decisi\u00f3n adoptada por el Comit\u00e9 Ejecutivo en marzo de 2007.\nPero en forma previa al inicio de las deliberaciones de la Asamblea General, el Comit\u00e9 Ejecutivo del Organismo debi\u00f3 sesionar durante los d\u00edas 3 y 4 de noviembre de 2007 a ra\u00edz del pedido efectuado por la delegaci\u00f3n iran\u00ed de postergar para el a\u00f1o siguiente el tratamiento de la cuesti\u00f3n. El Comit\u00e9 Ejecutivo rechaz\u00f3 la propuesta de aplazamiento y habilit\u00f3 a la Asamblea General para tratar el asunto.\nEl d\u00eda 7 de noviembre de 2007 lo inherente a la inscripci\u00f3n de las notificaciones rojas fue sometido a debate y posterior votaci\u00f3n de la\nALBERTO NISMAM Ministerio P\u00fablico de /a Naci\u00f3n\tfiscal general\nAsamblea General de Interpol. En esa oportunidad, luego que uno de los delegados de la parte iran\u00ed expusiera su postura ante las representaciones presentes, el suscripto en representaci\u00f3n de la delegaci\u00f3n argentina rebati\u00f3 tales alegaciones y brind\u00f3 los fundamentos que justificaban que sin demora se inscribieran las notificaciones rojas. Finalizadas las exposiciones, las misiones presentes votaron. La posici\u00f3n argentina fue aprobada por 78 votos a favor, 14 en contra y 26 abstenciones. De acuerdo a ello, el \u00f3rgano rector de la Organizaci\u00f3n Internacional de Polic\u00eda Criminal dio pleno aval a la postura propiciada por la delegaci\u00f3n argentina y como consecuencia orden\u00f3 la inscripci\u00f3n en car\u00e1cter de notificaci\u00f3n roja de los pedidos de captura librados contra los ciudadanos iran\u00edes Ali Fallahijan, Mohsen Rezai, Ahmad Vahidi, Mohsen Rabbani y Ahmad Reza Asghari, que se sumaron as\u00ed al ya vigente del liban\u00e9s Imad Fayez Moughnieh. El 13 de noviembre de 2007 se recibi\u00f3 en el sumario la comunicaci\u00f3n formal de Interpol acerca de la efectiva inscripci\u00f3n de tales \u00f3rdenes de captura.\nAs\u00ed, hab\u00eda culminado con \u00e9xito un largo e intrincado proceso, que, dadas las vicisitudes del sumario, signific\u00f3 un importante avance con miras al esclarecimiento del hecho. Por ello, la gesti\u00f3n de la Unidad Fiscal a cargo del suscripto logr\u00f3, por un amplio margen, la publicaci\u00f3n definitiva de las notificaciones rojas respecto de los sospechados en la causa, que no s\u00f3lo implic\u00f3 -en ese momento- la confirmaci\u00f3n del enderezamiento y avance de la investigaci\u00f3n, sino tambi\u00e9n el restablecimiento de la confianza de la comunidad internacional de naciones en la actividad, probidad y eficiencia de la justicia argentina que, en relaci\u00f3n a este caso, se hab\u00eda visto seriamente da\u00f1ada por el proceder del anterior juez.\nA partir de ello y durante los siguientes a\u00f1os, la Rep\u00fablica Argentina reclam\u00f3 a Ir\u00e1n, mediante distintos medios y en distintos foros internacionales, su falta de cooperaci\u00f3n con la investigaci\u00f3n y su renuencia a extraditar a los acusados. Por su parte, Ir\u00e1n nunca cedi\u00f3 ante los reclamos ni acept\u00f3 ninguna de las alternativas que ofreci\u00f3 Argentina para someter a proceso judicial a los imputados iran\u00edes.\nHasta que, al menos p\u00fablicamente, en septiembre de 2012, la Sra. Presidente de la Naci\u00f3n, Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez, anunci\u00f3 ante la Asamblea General de Naciones Unidas, haber instruido a su Canciller, H\u00e9ctor Timerman para que inicie un proceso de negociaci\u00f3n con Ir\u00e1n en tomo al caso AMIA. De acuerdo a la versi\u00f3n oficial, el Ministro Timerman se reuni\u00f3 por primera vez para tratar este tema con el canciller iran\u00ed Ali Akbar Salehi el d\u00eda 27 de septiembre de 2012.\nOficialmente, se comunicaron una serie de encuentros entre representantes de ambos pa\u00edses, sobre los que no se brindaron mayores detalles (Comunicados de Prensa del Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto de fecha 27/9/12 - N\u00b0 313/12; 29/10/12 -N\u00b0 353/12-; 31/10/12 \u2014 N\u00b0 360/12-; 1/12/12 - N\u00b0 391/12; 7/1/13 - N\u00b0 002/13-).\nExactamente cuatro meses m\u00e1s tarde y despu\u00e9s de tres reuniones en Suiza, con fecha 27 de enero de 2013, ambos cancilleres coincidieron en Etiop\u00eda, donde suscribieron el \u2019'''Memor\u00e1ndum de Entendimiento entre el Gobierno de la Rep\u00fablica Argentina y el Gobierno de la Rep\u00fablica Isl\u00e1mica de Ir\u00e1n sobre los temas vinculados al ataque terrorista a la sede de la AMIA en Buenos Aires el 18 de julio de 1994\u201d (Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto, Informaci\u00f3n de Prensa N\u00b0011/13, 27/01/2013).\nEl d\u00eda 7 de febrero de 2013, la Presidente de la Naci\u00f3n envi\u00f3 el acuerdo al Congreso Nacional para su aprobaci\u00f3n (Expediente N\u00b0 296/12), debiendo convocar a esos fines a sesiones extraordinarias, dado que el parlamento estaba en receso. Luego del tratamiento en comisiones, ambas c\u00e1maras legislativas aprobaron el acuerdo, que fue sancionado Ley Nacional N\u00b0 26.843 con fecha 27 de febrero y que, al d\u00eda siguiente, fue promulgada en el Bolet\u00edn Oficial del 1 de marzo, todos de 2013 (B.O. N\u00b0 32.591).\nPor su parte, con fecha 10 de marzo de 2013, el entonces Presidente de la Rep\u00fablica Isl\u00e1mica de Ir\u00e1n, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, envi\u00f3 el acuerdo a su parlamento (Majlis), que el 21 de marzo entr\u00f3 en receso por el A\u00f1o Nuevo del calendario persa (Nouruz) y reci\u00e9n volvi\u00f3 a sesionar a\npartir del 8 de abril, sin dar tratamiento en ning\u00fan momento al memorando, el cual fue eventualmente retirado de la agenda parlamentaria (Pagni, Carlos, \u201cEl kirchnerismo, en el peor de los mundos\u201d, La Naci\u00f3n 30/5/13; \u201cEl memorand\u00fan con Argentina llega al parlamento iran\u00ed\u201d, Europa Press, 11/3/2013; Kollmann, Ra\u00fal \u201cCon novedades semana a semana\u201d, P\u00e1gina 12, 24/3/13).\nM\u00e1s de dos meses despu\u00e9s, exactamente el d\u00eda 20 de mayo de 2013, Al\u00ed Pakdaman, entonces Encargado de Negocios de Ir\u00e1n en Buenos Aires, brind\u00f3 declaraciones a la prensa informando que el d\u00eda 19 de mayo el Presidente Ahmadinejad hab\u00eda aprobado el acuerdo con su sola firma (\u201cTeher\u00e1n aprob\u00f3 el memor\u00e1ndum por el atentado a la AMIA\u201d, P\u00e1gina 12, 20/05/2013; Kollmann, Ra\u00fal, \u201cAhmadinejad eligi\u00f3 la v\u00eda expeditiva\u201d, P\u00e1gina 12, 21/05/2013). Pero lo cierto es que nunca se recibi\u00f3, hasta el momento, notificaci\u00f3n formal de esta presunta aprobaci\u00f3n (Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto, Comunicado de Prensa N\u00b0110/13, 21/5/13).\nCon fecha 4 de agosto tuvo lugar la asunci\u00f3n del nuevo Presidente de la Rep\u00fablica Isl\u00e1mica de Ir\u00e1n, Hassan Rohani, y - en consecuencia- se operaron cambios de autoridades en distintos \u00e1mbitos gubernamentales de Teher\u00e1n.\nEl 28 de septiembre de 2013, transcurrido un a\u00f1o desde el inicio oficializado de las negociaciones, el nuevo Canciller iran\u00ed, Mohammad Javad Zarif, se reuni\u00f3 con el Ministro Timerman en la sede de las Naciones Unidas en Nueva York, Estados Unidos. Luego del encuentro, en declaraciones a la prensa, Timerman sostuvo que Javad Zarif le hab\u00eda asegurado que Ir\u00e1n hab\u00eda aprobado el memorando con el aval del Consejo Superior de Seguridad Nacional y del L\u00edder Supremo (Miri, Ignacio, \u201cTimerman dijo que Ir\u00e1n aprob\u00f3 el pacto por la AMIA, pero a\u00fan no rige\u201d, Clar\u00edn, 29/09/2013; Pisani, Silvia, \u201cIr\u00e1n le confirm\u00f3 a Timerman que ya aprob\u00f3 el acuerdo\u201d, La Naci\u00f3n, 29/09/2013; \u201cTimerman anunci\u00f3 nueva reuni\u00f3n con Ir\u00e1n en noviembre\u201d, Prensa Argentina, 28/09/2013; \u201cTimerman ratific\u00f3 la aprobaci\u00f3n del memor\u00e1ndum de entendimiento con Ir\u00e1n y un nuevo encuentro\u201d, T\u00e9lam, 28/09/2013; \u201cIr\u00e1n aprob\u00f3 el memor\u00e1ndum de entendimiento por la AMIA\u201d, P\u00e1gina 12, 28/09/2013).\nLuego de dos meses m\u00e1s de silencio por parte de Ir\u00e1n, funcionarios de ambas canciller\u00edas volvieron a reunirse en Z\u00farich, los d\u00edas 20 y 21 de noviembre de 2013, ocasi\u00f3n en que Argentina entreg\u00f3 una propuesta escrita sobre ciertas cuestiones relativas a la implementaci\u00f3n del memorando. Ir\u00e1n se comprometi\u00f3 a dar pronta respuesta (Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto, Informaci\u00f3n de Prensa N\u00b0 279/13, 24 de noviembre de 2013)\nSin embargo, hasta la fecha y a pesar de haber transcurrido m\u00e1s de un a\u00f1o y medio de su firma y sin perjuicio de las distintas declaraciones realizadas por los funcionarios persas, Ir\u00e1n no ha comunicado formalmente ning\u00fan tipo de aprobaci\u00f3n interna del acuerdo y - en consecuencia - no se ha producido el intercambio de notas verbales que signa la entrada en vigencia del memorando (punto 6).\nPor otra parte, ante distintos estrados judiciales argentinos se han formalizado diferentes planteos que cuestionan la constitucionalidad del citado memorando.\nEn concreto, con fecha 15 de mayo de 2014, la Sala I de la C\u00e1mara en lo Criminal y Correccional Federal de esta ciudad resolvi\u00f3 hacer lugar a la acci\u00f3n de amparo interpuesta por los representantes de AMIA y DAIA y, en consonancia con lo dictaminado por el suscripto, declar\u00f3 inconstitucionales tanto el Memor\u00e1ndum de Entendimiento como su ley aprobatoria. Asimismo, dicho tribunal orden\u00f3, de modo preventivo, comunicar lo resuelto al Poder Ejecutivo Nacional -en particular, a la Canciller\u00eda- para que no ejecute el acuerdo mientras transitan las v\u00edas recursivas. La Sala I tambi\u00e9n le orden\u00f3 al juez de la causa, Dr. Canicoba Corral, que reitere por v\u00eda diplom\u00e1tica los pedidos de extradici\u00f3n y cooperaci\u00f3n judicial a la Rep\u00fablica Isl\u00e1mica de Ir\u00e1n, que requiera a Interpol que extreme los esfuerzos para hacer efectivas las ordenes de captura e insista al organismo policial para que revea la posibilidad de emitir notificaciones rojas respecto de Rafsanjani, Velayati y Soleimanpour\n\nMinisterio P\u00fablico de la Naci\u00f3n\n(CCCF, Sala I, CFP 3184/2013/CA1 \u201cAMIA s/Amparo Ley 16.986, 15/05/2014, Juzgado N\u00b06- Secretar\u00eda N\u00b0ll). Finalmente, cabe tener presente que con fecha 30 de mayo del corriente, el Ministerio de Justicia y Derechos Humanos recurri\u00f3 la citada resoluci\u00f3n de la Alzada Federal.\nSin perjuicio de la vital importancia de contar con una decisi\u00f3n definitiva al respecto, lo cierto es que a los fines de la presente denuncia, este derrotero judicial constituye -en todo caso- una cuesti\u00f3n ajena a las conductas que, en sustancia, aqu\u00ed se han denunciado.\nb)\tLa postura de Ir\u00e1n en relaci\u00f3n con la causa AMIA:\nDesde el inicio de la investigaci\u00f3n de la causa AMIA y hasta la actualidad, la Rep\u00fablica Isl\u00e1mica de Ir\u00e1n siempre ha negado oficialmente el involucramiento de sus nacionales en el atentado; ha, adem\u00e1s, entorpecido la pesquisa de todas las formas posibles, por ejemplo, intentando desacreditar a las autoridades judiciales intervinientes; incluso ha tildado al gobierno argentino de financiar al terrorismo y ha intentado negociar pol\u00edticamente -en varias ocasiones- la absoluci\u00f3n de los acusados. Esta postura ha sido mantenida inalterada a lo largo de todos estos a\u00f1os, aun con posterioridad a la firma del acuerdo en enero de 2013.\nLa ret\u00f3rica iran\u00ed ha reiterado hasta el hartazgo que ninguno de sus nacionales particip\u00f3 en el atentado, que la justicia argentina no es confiable, que Ir\u00e1n condena al terrorismo y que est\u00e1 dispuesto a colaborar con Argentina para dar con los \u201cverdaderos culpables\u201d. Al hablar de \u201cverdaderos culpables\u201d, evidencia su postura: la acusaci\u00f3n argentina ha sido fabricada y orquestada por autoridades judiciales que responden al sionismo y a intereses for\u00e1neos, con la participaci\u00f3n de agencias de inteligencia de Estados Unidos e Israel.\nNumerosas declaraciones realizadas, a lo largo de los a\u00f1os, por distintos funcionarios persas, dan cuenta de la postura oficial de Ir\u00e1n, a saber: las misivas enviadas por el Embajador iran\u00ed ante la ONU, Mohammad Khazaee, al Presidente de la Asamblea General del organismo -\nfechadas en 28 de septiembre de 2007, 2008, 2009 y 2010-, las acusaciones formales y las tachas de descr\u00e9dito realizadas por funcionarios iran\u00edes en contra de distintas autoridades judiciales argentinas abocadas a la causa, etc. (cfr.: Documentos A/62/485, A/63/468, 4/64/481 y A/65/495, AGNU, ONU; \u201cSi los desagravian, Ir\u00e1n colaborar\u00eda con la causa AMIA\u201d, ADN Mundo, 4/12/2006; \u201cAMIA: Ir\u00e1n pidi\u00f3 ubicar al responsable real\u201d, Perfil, 29/11/2006; \u201cAMIA: Dura advertencia de Ir\u00e1n al gobierno de Kirchner\u201d, Diario de Cuyo, 11/12/2006; \u201cIr\u00e1n reaccion\u00f3 con agravios al pedido de N\u00e9stor Kirchner\u201d, Infobae, 27/09/2007; \u201cAhmadinejad dice que quiere expandir las relaciones con la Argentina\u201d, Clar\u00edn, 26/09/2013; Dinatale, Mart\u00edn, \u201cNeg\u00f3 Ir\u00e1n la denuncia del fiscal Nisman y lo acus\u00f3 de sionista\u201d, La Naci\u00f3n, 4/6/2013; \u201cPara Ir\u00e1n, la causa AMIA caus\u00f3 amargura en las relaciones entre Ir\u00e1n y Argentina\u201d, Agencia Jud\u00eda de Noticias, 16/07/2013; Braslavsky, Guido, \u201cIr\u00e1n pide a Interpol la captura del fiscal Nisman y de Galeano\u201d, Clar\u00edn, 13/11/2006; \u201cAMIA: dura respuesta iran\u00ed a los pedidos de capturas\u201d, Infobae, 13/11/2006; Gallo, Daniel, \u201cIr\u00e1n amenaza con pedir el arresto de agentes de Interpol\u201d, La Naci\u00f3n, 16/03/2007, \u201cIr\u00e1n volvi\u00f3 a criticar al sionismo\u201d, La Naci\u00f3n, 19/06/2013; Niebieskikwiat, Natasha, \u201cIr\u00e1n rechaz\u00f3, otra vez, su participaci\u00f3n en la AMIA\u201d, Clar\u00edn, 19/06/2013; \u201cIr\u00e1n ratific\u00f3 su adhesi\u00f3n plena al memor\u00e1ndum con Argentina\u201d, P\u00e1gina 12, 12/02/2013; \u201cKirchner orden\u00f3 expulsar a D'El\u00eda del gobierno\u201d, La Naci\u00f3n, 14/11/2006; \u201cTensi\u00f3n diplom\u00e1tica y despido de D'El\u00eda\u201d, La Voz, 14/11/2006; \u201cLa Canciller\u00eda respondi\u00f3 a otra protesta de Ir\u00e1n\u201d, Clar\u00edn, 13/12/2006; Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto, Comunicados de Prensa N\u00b0528/06 del 13/11/2006; Comunicado de Prensa N\u00b0000/07 \u201cArgentina rechaza pedido de exhorto de Ir\u00e1n\u201d, del 14/08/2007, Comunicado de Prensa N\u00b0400/07 \u201cLa canciller\u00eda argentina rechaza declaraciones difundidas por Ir\u00e1n\u201d, del 28/09/2007; \u201cArgentina expres\u00f3 un categ\u00f3rico rechazo a dichos de Ir\u00e1n\u201d, El D\u00eda, 28/09/2007; \u201cQue Ir\u00e1n respete la jurisdicci\u00f3n\u201d, P\u00e1gina 12, 29/09/2007).\nPuntualmente, en sus cartas al Presidente de la Asamblea General de Naciones Unidas, en los a\u00f1os 2007 a 2010, el Embajador de Ir\u00e1n\nante el organismo Mohammad Khazaee, ha realizado afirmaciones del estilo de: \u201c...los autores del atentado con bomba contra la AMIA han quedado impunes y, en su lugar, se ha acusado injusta e infundadamente a varios nacionales iran\u00edes inocentes...\u201d y \u201c...Todos los argumentos contra los nacionales iran\u00edes no son m\u00e1s que una farsa...\u201d (cfr.: Documentos A/62/485, A/63/468, 4/64/481 y A/65/495, AGNU, ONU).\nAhora bien, esta posici\u00f3n no est\u00e1 exenta de consecuencias pr\u00e1cticas. La Rep\u00fablica Isl\u00e1mica nunca ha prestado colaboraci\u00f3n a las autoridades judiciales argentinas, pese a declamar reiteradamente lo contrario.\nDe hecho, de 17 cartas rogatorias libradas  a Ir\u00e1n en el marco de la causa judicial requiriendo informaci\u00f3n para la investigaci\u00f3n del atentado, solamente se ha respondido una. Y esa respuesta fue para hacer saber su negativa a cumplir lo solicitado, argumentando excusas insostenibles y rechazando toda cooperaci\u00f3n judicial con el caso (fs. 126.761/126.779 y 127.614/127.657). Por lo dem\u00e1s, tambi\u00e9n han negado rotundamente la solicitud de detenci\u00f3n de los imputados con miras a su extradici\u00f3n, que se les formul\u00f3 mediante exhorto diplom\u00e1tico en el mes de noviembre de 2006 (fs. 127.063/127.080 y 128.205/128.220). En rigor de verdad, es realmente desvergonzado hablar de cooperaci\u00f3n con semejante historial de antecedentes.\nPor otra parte y como se adelant\u00f3, desde el a\u00f1o 2005, en la causa se encuentran acreditados distintos episodios en los cuales autoridades iran\u00edes plantearon, por v\u00edas diplom\u00e1ticas y en forma totalmente indolente, la posibilidad de \u201cnegociar\u201d de distintas maneras la extinci\u00f3n de toda investigaci\u00f3n, acusaci\u00f3n y/o pedido de captura contra sus nacionales (ver fs. 116.381/116.383, 117.251/117.253, 118.680 y 118.952/118.953 bis).\nEn efecto, en m\u00e1s de una ocasi\u00f3n, Ir\u00e1n busc\u00f3 negociar la impunidad de sus nacionales. Por ejemplo, el 3 de abril de 2005, el Encargado de Negocios de la Rep\u00fablica Argentina en Ir\u00e1n entreg\u00f3 en mano al Director del Departamento de Asuntos de Derecho Internacional de la Canciller\u00eda de ese pa\u00eds, un nuevo exhorto librado en la causa. En esa ocasi\u00f3n, el funcionario iran\u00ed condicion\u00f3 la respuesta de la rogatoria en los siguientes t\u00e9rminos: \u201c...Si asistimos al poder judicial argentino: a) \u00bfNo estaremos siendo vistos como acusados o sospechosos? b) Supongamos que recibimos los exhortos y los contestamos  Estar\u00e1 el juez dispuesto a anunciar y declarar tajantemente que no existe conexi\u00f3n ni de Ir\u00e1n ni de sus ciudadanos con la explosi\u00f3n de la AMIA? c) \u00bfQuedar\u00e1 o no el dossier abierto si contestamos? d) \u00bfc\u00f3mo podemos saber si el juez cerrar\u00e1 el dossier o no?\u201d\nY a\u00f1adi\u00f3: \u201cel asunto principal es que de alguna manera podamos estar convencidos de que si colaboramos, el juez de la causa llegar\u00e1 a la conclusi\u00f3n de que el se\u00f1or X o el se\u00f1or Y no est\u00e1n ni estuvieron implicados en la explosi\u00f3n de la AMIA. Recuerden que desde el 19 de julio de 1994 nos manifestamos dispuestos a colaborar con la justicia argentina, posici\u00f3n y oferta que contin\u00faa a\u00fan v\u00e1lida. Si tuvi\u00e9ramos garant\u00edas objetivas, cosas tangibles (resultados tangibles) no tendr\u00edamos ning\u00fan problema en: a) recibir todos los exhortos; b) contestar todos los exhortos: c) incluso m\u00e1s: hacer algunas investigaciones ulteriores en Ir\u00e1n... \u201d (fs. 116.381/116.383).\nLa misma t\u00f3nica se repiti\u00f3 por parte de los funcionarios iran\u00edes en la reuni\u00f3n celebrada en Teher\u00e1n en julio de 2005 entre representantes diplom\u00e1ticos de nuestro pa\u00eds y el Director de Asuntos de Derecho Internacional local, Dr. Mohsen Baharvand, en relaci\u00f3n con los exhortos pendientes de recepci\u00f3n y respuesta por parte del poder judicial iran\u00ed.\nEn esa ocasi\u00f3n, el funcionario iran\u00ed sostuvo lo siguiente: \u201cNecesitamos de esa visi\u00f3n de perspectiva para poder recibir los exhortos y responderlos, pues tenga en mente que se trata de funcionarios del gobierno iran\u00ed y no ciudadanos ordinarios; en definitiva, cada vez que uno tiene algo para dar tiene expectativas de recibir tambi\u00e9n (...) La parte iran\u00ed es sumamente flexible con los exhortos, solo complicamos las cosas cuando es absolutamente necesario (sic) y ese no es el caso de las relaciones con argentina \u201d (fs. 117.251/117.253).\nOtro ejemplo de esta actitud iran\u00ed en cuanto a su colaboraci\u00f3n en la causa surge de un \u201cnon paper\u201d entregado por el mencionado Baharvand a diplom\u00e1ticos argentinos, con una propuesta de acuerdo entre ambos pa\u00edses (fs. 118.680, 118.952/118.953bis).\nEl pacto ofrecido entonces por Ir\u00e1n dec\u00eda: \u201c1. Las partes aceptan que no ha existido ninguna acusaci\u00f3n contra ciudadanos iran\u00edes en relaci\u00f3n con la Causa AMIA; no obstante ello, el proceso que sigue el Juez argentino a cargo de la investigaci\u00f3n en lo que respecta a los ciudadanos iran\u00edes fue ordenado con el mero fin de recopilar informaci\u00f3n \u201d.\n\u201c2. Las partes... se abstendr\u00e1n de efectuar cualquier tipo de inferencia criminal, tanto en forma directa como indirecta, o acusaci\u00f3n contra la otra parte y sus funcionarios\n\u201c3... \u00a1as cartas rogatorias libradas por el Juez de la Argentina ser\u00e1n enmendadas de forma tal que no se formule ning\u00fan alegato o acusaci\u00f3n, ya sea en forma expl\u00edcita o impl\u00edcita, contra el gobierno iran\u00ed y sus ciudadanos... \u201d.\n\"4. Tras lo dispuesto en el p\u00e1rrafo tercero, el Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores de Ir\u00e1n recibir\u00e1 oficialmente \u00a1as cartas rogatorias... \u201d.\n\u201c5. La parte argentina ...revocar\u00e1 cualquier orden de arresto librada por el Juez a cargo de la investigaci\u00f3n contra los ciudadanos de la Rep\u00fablica Isl\u00e1mica de Ir\u00e1n...\nLa rese\u00f1a aqu\u00ed efectuada revela la ins\u00f3lita postura asumida por el gobierno iran\u00ed en el sentido de condicionar su colaboraci\u00f3n al compromiso de las autoridades judiciales argentinas de no incriminar a funcionarios y/o ciudadanos de ese pa\u00eds.\nPor otra parte y con motivo de dos solicitudes dirigidas a obtener informaci\u00f3n sobre titulares de l\u00edneas telef\u00f3nicas, las autoridades iran\u00edes, a trav\u00e9s de Interpol Teher\u00e1n, respondieron, a la primera de ellas: \u201cno nos es posible responder vuestra solicitud debido la importancia del respeto de los principios y de las reglas de los derechos humanos, y tambi\u00e9n de las leyes internas de Ir\u00e1n acerca del respeto de la vida privada de las personas\u201d (fs. 908 del legajo 391). En el restante pedido, lejos de brindar la informaci\u00f3n requerida, se limitaron a se\u00f1alar: \u201c...favor de explicarnos el motivo e informarnos tambi\u00e9n de d\u00f3nde obtuvieron estos n\u00fameros de tel\u00e9fono... \u201d (fs. 6843 del legajo 201).\nSentado ello, no puede menos que considerarse absurdas y descabelladas las excusas brindadas por el r\u00e9gimen iran\u00ed para no dar respuesta a las solicitudes argentinas, con el agravante de que, aun cuando luego fueron enviados a Teher\u00e1n los datos requeridos, ni siquiera as\u00ed se obtuvo contestaci\u00f3n.\nM\u00e1s all\u00e1 de la prueba documental, este tipo de ofrecimientos fueron reconocidos por varios funcionarios argentinos de entonces que, dadas sus posiciones en puestos claves, tomaron conocimiento de distintas propuestas de Ir\u00e1n para dejar de lado la imputaci\u00f3n por AMIA. Al respecto, cabe recordar un acuerdo rechazado por N\u00e9stor Kirchner del cual dieron cuenta el ex Jefe de Gabinete, Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez y el ex Vice Canciller, Roberto Garc\u00eda Morit\u00e1n. Por su parte, los ex Cancilleres Rafael Bielsa y Jorge Taiana, pusieron de manifiesto la postura de Ir\u00e1n aqu\u00ed descripta, conforme observaron durante sus respectivas gestiones en el Palacio San Mart\u00edn.\nRafael Bielsa mencion\u00f3 la oferta iran\u00ed de cuatro mil millones de d\u00f3lares en compras de ma\u00edz y trigo para retomar as\u00ed el comercio bilateral, pero a condici\u00f3n de dejar de lado la causa AMIA. Expres\u00f3: \u201c...era una actitud extorsiva... \u201d y al describir el desempe\u00f1o de la diplomacia iran\u00ed en general refiri\u00f3:\t\u201cSiempre nos estaban haciendo trampa...les\nexplic\u00e1bamos que ac\u00e1 el Poder Ejecutivo no le da \u00f3rdenes al Judicial, much\u00edsimo menos en una causa de esta naturaleza. Ellos se hac\u00edan los que no entend\u00edan...\u201d. Y agreg\u00f3: \u201c...Es un pa\u00eds manifiestamente hostil que se ha negado a contestar todos los exhortos... Les dec\u00edamos: los vamos a seguir hasta debajo de \u00a1a cama, ac\u00e1 no hay arreglo, contesten los exhortos. Uno de sus argumentos era: se est\u00e1n perdiendo 4 mil millones de d\u00f3lares...Jam\u00e1s hubo la m\u00e1s m\u00ednima concesi\u00f3n...ellos quer\u00edan que un punto sugiriera que pod\u00eda haber alg\u00fan error por parte del Poder Judicial en el requerimiento de estos dignatarios iran\u00edes...\u201d (el resaltado es propio, Dobry, Hern\u00e1n, \u201cCancilleres K: el acuerdo con Ir\u00e1n ya hab\u00eda sido rechazado\u201d, Perfil, 23/02/2013; \u201cCausa AMIA: Para D'El\u00eda, los acusados iran\u00edes van a ser sobrese\u00eddos\u201d, Infobae, 1/3/2013, \u201cIr\u00e1n le ofreci\u00f3 un acuerdo igual a N\u00e9stor Kirchner, pero lo rechaz\u00f3\u201d, Infobae, 14/02/2013; \u201cDuro cruce de acusaciones entre Timerman y Garc\u00eda Morit\u00e1n\u201d, La Naci\u00f3n, 19/02/2013; \u201cAlberto Fern\u00e1ndez: N\u00e9stor Kirchner siempre se neg\u00f3 a un acuerdo con Ir\u00e1n\u201d, Iprofesional, 20/02/2013).\nEn la misma l\u00ednea, el ex Canciller Jorge Taiana asever\u00f3 que los iran\u00edes hab\u00edan mostrado \u201cfalta de voluntad\u201d dado que \u201cni siquiera recib\u00edan las solicitudes, o sea, las rechazaban y descalificaban. No hubo ninguna muestra de que existiera la m\u00e1s m\u00ednima voluntad de ayudar a esclarecer el hecho...\u201d (Dobry, Hern\u00e1n, \u201cCancilleres K: el acuerdo con Ir\u00e1n ya hab\u00eda sido rechazado\u201d, Perfil, 23/02/2013).\nIncluso, las autoridades persas se han valido de ciudadanos argentinos profundamente consustanciados con las ideas del r\u00e9gimen y, al mismo tiempo, con v\u00ednculos con las autoridades del gobierno argentino, como Luis D\u2019El\u00eda, para hacer llegar sus propuestas de una soluci\u00f3n favorable a sus intereses en torno a las imputaciones del caso AMIA.\nEfectivamente, el r\u00e9gimen de Ir\u00e1n aprovech\u00f3 un viaje realizado por Luis D\u2019El\u00eda, Fernando Esteche y Jorge \u201cYussuf\u2019 Khalil, a fines de febrero y principios de marzo de 2010, para proponer un acuerdo relacionado con el atentado (\u201cQuejas de Israel por el viaje de D'El\u00eda a Ir\u00e1n\u201d, La Naci\u00f3n, 07/03/2010; \u201cD'El\u00eda admiti\u00f3 un encuentro con un ex funcionario iran\u00ed pr\u00f3fugo en la causa AMIA\u201d, La Prensa, 07/03/2010; \u201cD\u2019El\u00eda y Esteche vieron en Ir\u00e1n a un sospechoso de volar la AMIA\u201d, Perfil, 06/03/2010; \u201cD'El\u00eda sigue defendiendo al pr\u00f3fugo de la AMIA: Es una buena persona\u201d, Clar\u00edn, 09/03/2010; \u201cDiputados repudi\u00f3 el viaje de D\u2019El\u00eda a Ir\u00e1n y pidi\u00f3 informes a Canciller\u00eda\u201d, Infobae, 07/04/2010). Incre\u00edblemente ahora se constata que dicho acuerdo era similar al Memorando de Entendimiento firmado por el canciller Timerman en enero del a\u00f1o pasado. As\u00ed lo record\u00f3 D\u2019El\u00eda al manifestarle a Khalil: \u201c...Es parecido a lo que nos propusieron en el primer viaje a Teher\u00e1n \u00bfte acord\u00e1s?...\u201d (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 27/01/13, abonado N\u00b011-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2013-01-27-174637-12, CD 266).\nEsto da la pauta, como se analizar\u00e1 y acreditar\u00e1 en detalle en el ac\u00e1pite correspondiente, que el instrumento jur\u00eddico que han firmado Argentina e Ir\u00e1n nada tiene que ver con la b\u00fasqueda de justicia ni con el avance de la investigaci\u00f3n sino que se trata de uno de los medios elegidos para conseguir un fin delictivo y atroz: garantizar la impunidad definitiva a los acusados iran\u00edes de la causa por el atentado contra la AMIA a trav\u00e9s de un salvoconducto con apariencia de legalidad.\nFinalmente, cabe recordar, solo a modo de ejemplo porque fueron muchos los intentos de Teher\u00e1n en este sentido, que en septiembre de 2007, el entonces vocero del Ministerio de Asuntos Exteriores de Ir\u00e1n, Mohammad Al\u00ed Hosseini, ofreci\u00f3: \u201cComo acto humanitario y para esclarecer los hechos de esta tragedia, la Rep\u00fablica Isl\u00e1mica anunci\u00f3 de antemano admitir la formaci\u00f3n de un comit\u00e9 jur\u00eddico bilateral con Argentina, a pesar de la ausencia de acuerdo y desavenencia que hay entre los aparatos judiciales de ambos pa\u00edses'\u2019\u2019\u2019 (\u201cIr\u00e1n reaccion\u00f3 con agravios al pedido de N\u00e9stor Kirchner\u201d, Infobae, 27/09/2007). Obviamente, ese ofrecimiento -no muy distinto al acuerdo firmado- fue rechazado por N\u00e9stor Kirchner.\nEn fin, Ir\u00e1n siempre sostuvo y pidi\u00f3 lo mismo, lo que confirma que en dicho pa\u00eds existi\u00f3 y existe la decisi\u00f3n pol\u00edtica no solo de no cooperar y de no reconocer la soberan\u00eda jurisdiccional argentina en el caso, sino de entorpecer y atacar todo avance que se realice.\nAhora bien, resulta claro que la elocuente falta de cooperaci\u00f3n exhibida por las autoridades iran\u00edes respecto de esta investigaci\u00f3n, es el reflejo, o bien la consecuencia, de la estrategia hist\u00f3ricamente sostenida por el r\u00e9gimen de Teher\u00e1n que consisti\u00f3 y consiste a\u00fan hoy en negar toda relaci\u00f3n de sus ciudadanos con el atentado y jam\u00e1s brindar cualquier tipo de informaci\u00f3n a la pesquisa para, as\u00ed, desligar toda responsabilidad que le pudiera caber por actos de terrorismo, negando la detenci\u00f3n con fines de extradici\u00f3n de los individuos que la justicia argentina ha imputado judicialmente por el hecho y buscando deslegitimar -de distintas formas- a la investigaci\u00f3n y a las autoridades que la encabezan. Eso demuestra que existe una decisi\u00f3n pol\u00edtica para garantizar impunidad tomada por las m\u00e1s altas autoridades del r\u00e9gimen, que tambi\u00e9n planificaron y ordenaron el atentado que acab\u00f3 con la vida de 85 personas.\nSin perjuicio de la firme negativa del r\u00e9gimen, se han obtenido declaraciones reveladoras de Jorge \u201cYussuf\u2019 Khalil, representante de los intereses y agente org\u00e1nico de Ir\u00e1n en Argentina y part\u00edcipe activo del encubrimiento aqu\u00ed denunciado, que reconocen la responsabilidad de funcionarios iran\u00edes en los atentados en Argentina. En referencia a un individuo se\u00f1al\u00f3: \u201c...la persona que tabur\u00f3 con Ir\u00e1n...cuando Ir\u00e1n mat\u00f3 ac\u00e1\u201d (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 19/11/12, abonado N\u00b011-3315-6908, Archivo B- 1009-2012-11-19-083552-16, CD 197). En otra oportunidad, confes\u00f3 que el Subsecretario de Agricultura Familiar para la Naci\u00f3n y l\u00edder del Movimiento Evita, Emilio P\u00e9rsico: \u201c...siempre tuvo el discurso de que nosotros fuimos....y est\u00e1 bien hecho... as i dice \u00e9l. Es la pelea\u201d (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 15/8/13, abonado N\u00b011-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009- 2013-08-15-234919-2, CD 118). Es decir, que los iran\u00edes fueron los responsables del atentado y que a entender de P\u00e9rsico estaban justificados por su lucha pol\u00edtica. En igual sentido, citando a D\u2019El\u00eda, P\u00e9rsico: \"...fue el que dijo que ustedes fueron el tema AMIA...\u201d, en alusi\u00f3n a la responsabilidad de iran\u00edes por el atentado (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 15/8/13, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-08-15-234225-2, CD 118). Estas referencias solo deben ser entendidas como meros ejemplos y, en modo alguno, como nuevas pruebas para fundar la acusaci\u00f3n por el atentado, que -como se sabe- ya ha sido volcada en anteriores dict\u00e1menes fiscales y en los pronunciamientos del Juez de la causa, Dr. Canicoba Corral.\nEstas manifestaciones tampoco hacen a la prueba del encubrimiento, sin embargo permiten visualizar que la estrategia del r\u00e9gimen de la Rep\u00fablica Isl\u00e1mica de Ir\u00e1n de negaci\u00f3n perpetua rindi\u00f3 sus frutos. Es decir, a pesar de ser efectivamente responsables por el atentado, la circunstancia de haberlo negado por lustros y lustros acab\u00f3 desembocando en este plan encubridor que pretendi\u00f3 desacreditar a la justicia argentina y, fundamentalmente, estuvo dirigido a garantizar la impunidad total y definitiva de los acusados iran\u00edes.\nDe hecho, seg\u00fan surge del documento que bajo juramento declar\u00f3 haber le\u00eddo el Sr. Jos\u00e9 Eliaschev, la solidez de la postura iran\u00ed de no cooperar judicialmente ni ceder un \u00e1pice antes las acusaciones argentinas fue reconocida por el ex canciller iran\u00ed Ali Akbar Salehi como una exitosa estrategia del L\u00edder Supremo. Salehi elogi\u00f3 esta estrategia cuando -como se ver\u00e1 m\u00e1s adelante-, en enero de 2011, H\u00e9ctor Timerman abandon\u00f3 el reclamo argentino de justicia y le ofreci\u00f3 articular un modo para dejar de lado las acusaciones por el atentado y retomar el comercio bilateral (fs. 131.189/131.194; Eliaschev, Pepe, \u201cArgentina negocia con Ir\u00e1n dejar de lado la investigaci\u00f3n de los atentados\u201d, Diario Perfil, 26/03/2011, fs. 130.911/130.913).\nEn suma, Ir\u00e1n nunca tuvo intenci\u00f3n de cooperar y, en la pr\u00e1ctica, siempre estorb\u00f3 la actuaci\u00f3n judicial argentina y los acercamientos diplom\u00e1ticos, pol\u00edticos y judiciales que acept\u00f3 tuvieron por \u00fanica finalidad extinguir las acusaciones contra sus nacionales y desvincular a Ir\u00e1n del caso, aunque ello se derivara de la aplicaci\u00f3n de medios prohibidos.\nResulta \u00fatil destacar que esta estrategia no solamente ha sido implementada por Teher\u00e1n respecto al caso AMIA, sino que tambi\u00e9n fue\n\n\nMinisterio P\u00fablico de la Naci\u00f3n\nreplicada en relaci\u00f3n a otros atentados terroristas perpetrados en distintos rincones del planeta donde, tambi\u00e9n fundadamente, se ha involucrado judicialmente a funcionarios del r\u00e9gimen iran\u00ed como responsable de hechos de terrorismo.\nJam\u00e1s se ha advertido cambio alguno en la postura iran\u00ed, que ni siquiera moriger\u00f3 su cl\u00e1sica ret\u00f3rica despu\u00e9s de iniciadas oficialmente las negociaciones y a\u00fan luego de haber firmado el Memorando de Entendimiento, alegando \u201cde la boca para afuera\u201d, como es su costumbre, su buena predisposici\u00f3n para el di\u00e1logo y la negociaci\u00f3n, al tiempo que, en los hechos, buscaba deslegitimar por cualquier medio los pronunciamientos de la justicia argentina y, consecuentemente, tambi\u00e9n a sus funcionarios.\nEn esta l\u00ednea se inscriben los siguientes cuatro episodios, solo a modo de ejemplo: 1) el entonces portavoz de la canciller\u00eda iran\u00ed, Ramin Mehmanparast, declar\u00f3 en octubre de 2012 -cuando las negociaciones ya eran p\u00fablicas- que se rechazaban las acusaciones contra ciudadanos iran\u00edes y que su gobierno estaba dispuesto a colaborar para dar con los ejecutores del atentado (\u201cIr\u00e1n volvi\u00f3 a rechazar todas las acusaciones por el atentado a la AMIA\u201d, La Naci\u00f3n, 30/10/2012;

2) seg\u00fan un cable de la agencia IRNA, la postura oficial de Ir\u00e1n -ya firmado el acuerdo con Argentina- era que el atentado podr\u00eda haber sido planeado por Israel: \u201c...Ir\u00e1n dice que agentes de Tel Aviv estuvieron involucrados en el ataque...con el objetivo de aumentar su influencia sobre el gobierno de entonces en Buenos Aires...\u201d (\u201cIr\u00e1n ratific\u00f3 su adhesi\u00f3n plena al memor\u00e1ndum con Argentina\u201d, P\u00e1gina 12, 12/02/2013;

\u201cSalehi: Ir\u00e1n Argentina adhere to agreement on AMIA case\u201d, IRNA, 12/02/2013); 3) las expresiones de la canciller\u00eda iran\u00ed que buscaron deslegitimar el trabajo de la Unidad Fiscal a cargo del suscripto y el dictamen de fecha 29/05/2013 sosteniendo:\n\u201c...Debido a la historia y car\u00e1cter sionista de ese fiscal , nosotros no damos ninguna importancia a sus afirmaciones...\u201d (\u201cIr\u00e1n rechaz\u00f3 las acusaciones del fiscal Alberto Nisman al considerarlo sionista\u201d, La Naci\u00f3n, 3/6/2013; \u201cEl ministerio exteriores de Ir\u00e1n: No le damos importancia a las declaraciones de Nisman\u201d, IRNA, 5/6/2013); 4) en junio de 2013, ya firmado el acuerdo, otro vocero de la canciller\u00eda iran\u00ed -Abbas Araqchi- volvi\u00f3 a rechazar la participaci\u00f3n de iran\u00edes en el atentado, declar\u00f3 que para Teher\u00e1n fueron agentes extranjeros y sionistas los que estuvieron detr\u00e1s del ataque y agreg\u00f3: \u201cGracias a Dios, con la colaboraci\u00f3n de los cancilleres de Ir\u00e1n y la Argentina, se est\u00e1 viendo la manera razonable para solucionar el tema de la AMIA, y est\u00e1 habiendo una mayor comprensi\u00f3n de que los factores extranjeros y sionistas fueron los verdaderos causantes de este lamentable hecho...\u201d (Niebieskikwiat, Natasha, \u201cIr\u00e1n rechaz\u00f3, otra vez, su participaci\u00f3n en la AMIA\u201d, Clar\u00edn, 19/06/2013; \u201cIr\u00e1n volvi\u00f3 a criticar al sionismo\u201d, La Naci\u00f3n, 19/06/2013), acusaciones que reiterar\u00eda el mismo portavoz en julio de 2013 (\u201cPara Ir\u00e1n, la causa AMIA caus\u00f3 amargura en las relaciones entre Ir\u00e1n y Argentina\u201d, Agencia Jud\u00eda de Noticias, 16/07/2013).\nNunca antes el gobierno argentino hab\u00eda permanecido mudo ante este tipo de declaraciones. Pero desde que se produjo el acercamiento con Ir\u00e1n, comenz\u00f3 un silencio c\u00f3mplice de parte de las autoridades argentinas aqu\u00ed denunciadas ante este tipo de expresiones y/o ataques a los actos jurisdiccionales soberanos de distintos \u00f3rganos de la rep\u00fablica, variando la postura que se mantuvo inalterada durante el mandato de N\u00e9stor Kirchner, lo que constituye un nuevo indicio de la existencia de un acuerdo previo entre las dos partes que -desafortunadamente- tuvo por norte el plan de encubrimiento aqu\u00ed denunciado, en el cual las autoridades argentinas se mostraron m\u00e1s interesadas en avanzar que su contraparte. As\u00ed, el incomprensible silencio del gobierno argentino, mantenido a pesar de la gravedad de las acusaciones y desacreditaciones por parte de las autoridades del gobierno iran\u00ed, habla por s\u00ed solo en este nuevo contexto.\nEs decir, las autoridades iran\u00edes persisten, hasta el presente, no solo en negar oficialmente toda colaboraci\u00f3n de Ir\u00e1n con el caso, sino - fundamentalmente- agrediendo y buscando desacreditar de distintas formas la acusaci\u00f3n de la justicia argentina, pretendiendo poner en duda la imparcialidad de las investigaciones y sugiriendo -siempre- la influencia de intereses for\u00e1neos que hab\u00edan sesgado la pesquisa aviesamente en contra de Ir\u00e1n.\nM\u00e1s recientemente y en ocasi\u00f3n del fallo de la C\u00e1mara en lo Criminal y Correccional Federal que declar\u00f3 la inconstitucionalidad del Memorando de Entendimiento firmado con Ir\u00e1n, y de su ley aprobatoria, las autoridades iran\u00edes tuvieron una reacci\u00f3n a todas luces provocativa, teniendo en cuenta, fundamentalmente, su parsimonia en tomo a la aprobaci\u00f3n del acuerdo. En esa oportunidad, la vocera del Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores, Marziyeh Afkham, conden\u00f3 fuertemente el fallo y declar\u00f3: \u201cEl gobierno iran\u00ed cree que el Memorando de Entendimiento era una soluci\u00f3n adecuada y una oportunidad para descubrir los hechos relativos a la tragedia de la AMIA y la resoluci\u00f3n de las diferencias al respecto, pero la decisi\u00f3n de la corte argentina priva a ambas partes de esa oportunidad. Por \u00a1o tanto, la Rep\u00fablica Isl\u00e1mica de Ir\u00e1n expresa su pesar y descontento por la decisi\u00f3n\u2019\u2019\u2019 (\u201cIr\u00e1n criticizes Argentine court decisi\u00f3n to declare unconstitutional joint AMIA bombing probe with Ir\u00e1n\u201d, IRNA, 16/05/2014; \u201cIr\u00e1n slams argentine court ruling on AMIA probe\u201d, Fars News Agency, 17/05/2014; \u201cIr\u00e1n condemns argentine court ruling on AMIA probe\u201d, PressTV, 16/05/2014; Niebieskikwiat, Natasha, \u201cIr\u00e1n lamenta la decisi\u00f3n de la Justicia argentina\u201d, Clar\u00edn, 16/05/2014; \u201cIr\u00e1n expres\u00f3 pesar y descontento por el fallo que invalid\u00f3 el memor\u00e1ndum sobre el atentado a la AMIA\u201d, La Naci\u00f3n, 16/05/2014). El doble discurso no solo es patrimonio exclusivo de las autoridades argentinas aqu\u00ed denunciadas. Los iran\u00edes han sabido utilizarlo a la perfecci\u00f3n. Es decir que, a pesar del tiempo transcurrido sin que exista comunicaci\u00f3n oficial de aprobaci\u00f3n interna del acuerdo por parte de Ir\u00e1n, sus autoridades sostuvieron p\u00fablicamente su inter\u00e9s en el pacto. Nuevamente, la kilom\u00e9trica distancia entre las palabras y los hechos.\nFinalmente, solo resta destacar que la ret\u00f3rica de negaci\u00f3n y obstrucci\u00f3n iran\u00ed tuvo excelente resonancia en el gobierno de Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez y, seg\u00fan se ver\u00e1 m\u00e1s adelante, fue usufructuada por las autoridades argentinas aqu\u00ed denunciadas, para avanzar con las maniobras de encubrimiento e impunidad de los acusados.\nc)\tPresidencia de N\u00e9stor Carlos Kirchner\nDurante el gobierno de N\u00e9stor Kirchner la posici\u00f3n de la Rep\u00fablica Argentina en relaci\u00f3n al atentado contra la AMIA fue clara y consistente: todos los esfuerzos pol\u00edticos se enderezaron a respaldar el accionar de la justicia argentina y, desde el \u00e1mbito de sus competencias, el entonces Presidente de la Naci\u00f3n intent\u00f3 lograr la cooperaci\u00f3n de Ir\u00e1n y el aval de la comunidad internacional. Es decir, durante todo su mandato, se mantuvo de manera inconmovible el apoyo del Poder Ejecutivo Nacional a las conclusiones de este Ministerio P\u00fablico y a las decisiones del Poder Judicial en tomo a la causa. El caso AMIA fue una pol\u00edtica de Estado.\nEste respaldo se tradujo en distintas acciones concretas, que van desde la desclasificaci\u00f3n de informaci\u00f3n de inteligencia (Decreto N\u00b0 787 del 17 de septiembre de 2003) y la creaci\u00f3n de esta Unidad Fiscal de Investigaci\u00f3n en el a\u00f1o 2004 (Resoluci\u00f3n MP 84/04), hasta el discurso pronunciado por el ex Presidente en el a\u00f1o 2007 ante la Asamblea General de las Naciones Unidas, cuando denunci\u00f3 la falta de colaboraci\u00f3n de Ir\u00e1n y solicit\u00f3 que \u201cla Rep\u00fablica Isl\u00e1mica de Ir\u00e1n, en el marco del derecho internacional aplicable, acepte y respete la jurisdicci\u00f3n de la justicia argentina, y colabore eficazmente con los jueces argentinos para lograr el sometimiento a juicio de las personas imputadas en aquellos hechos\u2019\u2019'\u2019 (Discurso de N\u00e9stor Kirchner en la 62a Asamblea General de Naciones Unidas, 25 de septiembre de 2007).\n2\tSe trata de: Al\u00ed Akbar Hashemi Bahramaie Rafsanjani (a la \u00e9poca de los hechos presidente de la Rep\u00fablica Isl\u00e1mica de Ir\u00e1n), Al\u00ed Fallahijan (por entonces Ministro de Informaci\u00f3n iran\u00ed), Al\u00ed Akbar Velayati (en aquel tiempo Ministro de Relaciones Exteriores de la naci\u00f3n persa), Mohsen Rezai (por entonces a cargo del Cuerpo de la Guardia Revolucionaria \u201cPasdaran\u201d), Ahmad Vahidi (en aquella \u00e9poca a cargo de la fuerza de elite \u201cAl Quds\u201d perteneciente a la Guardia Revolucionaria), Mohsen Rabbani (al tiempo de los hechos Consejero Cultural de la Embajada iran\u00ed en nuestro pa\u00eds), Ahmad Reza Asghari o Mohsen Randjbaran (en aquel entonces Tercer Secretario de la representaci\u00f3n diplom\u00e1tica iran\u00ed en nuestro medio), Hadi Soleimanpour (en aquella \u00e9poca Embajador de la Rep\u00fablica Isl\u00e1mica de Ir\u00e1n en Buenos Aires) e Imad Fayez Moughnieh (por entonces a cargo del Servicio Exterior del Hezbollah). Moughnieh era el \u00fanico liban\u00e9s en aquel resolutorio. Los dem\u00e1s eran todos ciudadanos iran\u00edes. La Unidad Fiscal no formul\u00f3 imputaci\u00f3n a Hadi Soleimanpour, sin perjuicio de lo cual, el Sr. Juez de la causa fund\u00f3 la acusaci\u00f3n y dispuso tambi\u00e9n su captura.\nDe ese modo, N\u00e9stor Kirchner inaugur\u00f3 este destacable recurso diplom\u00e1tico: peticionar ante la comunidad internacional, utilizando leg\u00edtima y estrat\u00e9gicamente los foros y la opini\u00f3n internacionales para poner en evidencia la inadmisible postura iran\u00ed, convirtiendo -de ese modo- al descr\u00e9dito internacional en un factor de presi\u00f3n leg\u00edtimo y conducente a lograr el objetivo requerido por los \u00f3rganos judiciales: el sometimiento a proceso de los imputados iran\u00edes para avanzar en el enjuiciamiento de aquellas personas judicialmente responsabilizadas por el atentado contra la sede de la AMIA.\nAdem\u00e1s, y en cada oportunidad en que el gobierno de la Rep\u00fablica Isl\u00e1mica de Ir\u00e1n, a trav\u00e9s de declaraciones de sus funcionarios y/o por otras v\u00edas, intent\u00f3 deslegitimar la investigaci\u00f3n por el caso AMIA haciendo llegar descalificaciones respecto de los funcionarios intervinientes en la pesquisa y -m\u00e1s a\u00fan- cuando se conocieron acusaciones judiciales de Ir\u00e1n contra estos funcionarios, el gobierno del Presidente N\u00e9stor Kirchner siempre repudi\u00f3 aquellos descr\u00e9ditos, pidiendo -por las v\u00edas diplom\u00e1ticas correspodientes- las explicaciones a que hubiere lugar, como un modo adecuado de proteger y respaldar el accionar de la justicia argentina.\nEjemplo de ello fue la reacci\u00f3n que tuvo el Poder Ejecutivo cuando en el a\u00f1o 2006, se conocieron trascendidos que aseveraban que la justicia iran\u00ed solicitar\u00eda el arresto y la extradici\u00f3n del suscripto y del Dr. Juan Jos\u00e9 Galeano, ya separado de la magistratura, ocasi\u00f3n en que la Canciller\u00eda argentina no demor\u00f3 en solicitar explicaciones sobre la cuesti\u00f3n al Encargado de Negocios iran\u00ed en Buenos Aires, Mohsen Baharvand, m\u00e1xima autoridad diplom\u00e1tica persa en territorio nacional (Comunicado de Prensa N\u00b0528/06 del Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto de fecha 13/11/2006; Braslavsky, Guido, \u201cIr\u00e1n pide a Interpol la captura del fiscal Nisman y de Galeano\u201d, Clar\u00edn, 13/11/2006, \u201cAMIA: dura respuesta iran\u00ed a los pedidos de capturas\u201d, Infobae, 13/11/2006; \u201cTensi\u00f3n diplom\u00e1tica y despido de D'El\u00eda\u201d, La Voz, 14/011/2006).\nY\tno fue la \u00fanica oportunidad en que la canciller\u00eda argentina respondi\u00f3 a protestas indebidas o expresiones desafortunadas, por\ncalificarlas de la forma m\u00e1s ben\u00e9vola, procedentes de funcionarios de Teher\u00e1n (cfr.: \u201cLa Canciller\u00eda respondi\u00f3 a otra protesta de Ir\u00e1n\u201d, Clar\u00edn, 13/12/2006; Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto, Comunicado de Prensa N\u00b0000/07 \u201cArgentina rechaza pedido de exhorto de Ir\u00e1n\u201d, del 14/08/2007; Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto, Comunicado de Prensa N\u00b0400/07, \u201cLa canciller\u00eda argentina rechaza declaraciones difundidas por Ir\u00e1n\u201d, del 28/09/2007; \u201cArgentina expres\u00f3 un categ\u00f3rico rechazo a dichos de Ir\u00e1n\u201d, El D\u00eda, 28/09/2007; \u201cQue Ir\u00e1n respete la jurisdicci\u00f3n\u201d, P\u00e1gina 12, 29/09/2007).\nComo prueba del posicionamiento pol\u00edtico-estrat\u00e9gico que N\u00e9stor Kirchner adopt\u00f3 en torno al caso AMIA desde el Palacio San Mart\u00edn, cabe tener presente las palabras de los ex Cancilleres, Jorge Taiana y Rafael Bielsa.\nAl respecto, el ex Ministro Taiana sostuvo: \u201cNo hubo ning\u00fan di\u00e1logo. Nuestro planteo era: no se puede hablar de nada mientras no haya colaboraci\u00f3n judicial...Nuestra posici\u00f3n fue:\ttenemos 85 muertos\nargentinos y no podemos hacer ninguna concesi\u00f3n ni darle facilidad a un Estado que no muestra signos de buscar alg\u00fan tipo de soluci\u00f3n que ayude a esclarecer el hecho...\u201d.

Esto resume la direcci\u00f3n que la pol\u00edtica exterior tuvo en aquellos a\u00f1os en lo concerniente al caso AMIA.\nA nivel local, N\u00e9stor Kirchner tambi\u00e9n mantuvo en todo momento su apoyo a la causa judicial, al punto de separar del cargo a un miembro de su propio gobierno, como ocurri\u00f3 con el caso de Luis D\u2019El\u00eda.\nCabe recordar que en noviembre de 2006, casi inmediatamente despu\u00e9s de conocerse la resoluci\u00f3n del Dr. Rodolfo Canicoba Corral que decret\u00f3 las capturas de funcionarios iran\u00edes por estar sospechados de participar en el atentado, el entonces Subsecretario Nacional de Tierras para el H\u00e1bitat Social, Sr. Luis D\u2019 El\u00eda, encabez\u00f3 una protesta contra aquella decisi\u00f3n y emiti\u00f3 un comunicado expresando: \u201cel dictamen judicial que acusa a la Rep\u00fablica Isl\u00e1mica de Ir\u00e1n por el tema AMIA est\u00e1 profundamente contaminado por circunstancias mundiales ajenas a la b\u00fasqueda de la verdad\u2019\u2019 (Comunicado del 13/11/2006, firmado por Luis D'El\u00eda y Juan Jos\u00e9 Cantiello, entregado al entonces Encargado de Negocios de Ir\u00e1n en Buenos Aires, Mohsen Baharvand).\nSeg\u00fan trascendi\u00f3, la protesta en repudio a la decisi\u00f3n de la justicia argentina, llevada a cabo en la Embajada de Ir\u00e1n y liderada por D'El\u00eda -con participaci\u00f3n del referente de Ir\u00e1n en Argentina, Jorge Alejandro \u201cYussuf\u2019 Khalil- hab\u00eda sido incitada por el entonces Embajador de Venezuela en Buenos Aires, Roger Capella.

Y a Luis D'El\u00eda, le confes\u00f3: \u201c... \u00bfSab\u00e9s quien me lo escribi\u00f3 a m\u00ed, ese d\u00eda, el memorando ese, qui\u00e9n lo escribi\u00f3?...Fernando...\u201d, en alusi\u00f3n a Esteche (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 27/01/13, abonado N\u00b011-3315- 6908, Archivo B-l009-2013-01-27-174637-12, CD 266).\nLo cierto es que en todos los casos, el gobierno de N\u00e9stor Kirchner entendi\u00f3 -justamente- que estas propuestas conllevaban una injerencia inadecuada del Ejecutivo en el \u00e1mbito judicial y - fundamentalmente- representaban una claudicaci\u00f3n en el reclamo leg\u00edtimo de memoria y justicia por el caso AMIA.\nEn suma, durante todo su mandato y podr\u00eda decirse mientras vivi\u00f3, el ex Presidente N\u00e9stor Kirchner fue consecuente con su postura con el caso AMIA: un fuerte reclamo a Ir\u00e1n por su falta de cooperaci\u00f3n en la causa, la firme decisi\u00f3n de rechazar las propuestas iran\u00edes que propiciaban dejar de lado las conclusiones de la justicia argentina y su inestimable apoyo a lo actuado por ella en la investigaci\u00f3n por el atentado contra la sede de la AMIA fueron los ejes centrales de esta pol\u00edtica de estado.\na)\tPresidencia de Cristina Elisabet Fern\u00e1ndez\nLa l\u00ednea forjada por N\u00e9stor Kirchner en torno al caso continu\u00f3 durante los primeros a\u00f1os del mandato de su esposa Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez, quien tambi\u00e9n, en la sede de las Naciones Unidas, reclam\u00f3 a Ir\u00e1n por su negativa a permitir que los imputados sean sometidos a la justicia argentina.\nLa inconmovible negativa iran\u00ed a cumplir con este leg\u00edtimo requerimiento fue logrando, de alg\u00fan modo, erosionar las expectativas del gobierno nacional en los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os y, en consecuencia, los reclamos articulados desde entonces evidenciaron condicionamientos que, en cierta medida, los hicieron contraer. En este sentido, el ofrecimiento de realizar el juicio en un tercer pa\u00eds y/o ante la presencia de veedores internacionales represent\u00f3 cierta flexibilizaci\u00f3n -leg\u00edtima, por cierto- de la demanda inicial. Sin embargo, a\u00fan en esas instancias, el objetivo perseguido consisti\u00f3 siempre en que Ir\u00e1n someta a los imputados a nuestra jurisdicci\u00f3n, es decir, a nuestras leyes, nuestros jueces y a nuestra investigaci\u00f3n.\nJustamente, en esa l\u00ednea, el 24 de septiembre de 2010, la Sra. Presidente Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez se dirigi\u00f3 a la Asamblea General de Naciones Unidas y ofreci\u00f3 la posibilidad de elegir de com\u00fan acuerdo un tercer pa\u00eds en donde llevar a cabo el enjuiciamiento de los ciudadanos iran\u00edes acusados por el atentado (Discurso de Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez en la 65\u00b0 Asamblea General de la Organizaci\u00f3n de las Naciones Unidas, 24 de septiembre de 2010).\nDicha oferta fue respondida mediante una carta del Representante Permanente de la Rep\u00fablica Isl\u00e1mica de Ir\u00e1n ante Naciones Unidas, Embajador Mohammed Khazaee, en la cual expres\u00f3 que las acusaciones argentinas carec\u00edan de fundamento y que la actual investigaci\u00f3n transitaba un ''''camino equivocado\u201d que no llevar\u00eda a encontrar a los \u201caut\u00e9nticos autores\u201d del atentado. Tach\u00f3 de falsa, arbitraria e infundada la acusaci\u00f3n a los ciudadanos iran\u00edes, afirmando que el procedimiento judicial argentino estaba plagado de irregularidades, violaba garant\u00edas procesales y derechos fundamentales y no ten\u00eda por fin la verdad y la justicia. Asimismo, asever\u00f3 que: \u201cEl Gobierno de la Rep\u00fablica Isl\u00e1mica del Ir\u00e1n se ha cerciorado de que ning\u00fan ciudadano iran\u00ed estuvo implicado, directa o indirectamente, en la explosi\u00f3n del AMIA\u201d. Y acus\u00f3 a las autoridades argentinas de colaborar y financiar a grupos terroristas -como los Muyahidin Jalq- para, finalmente, afirmar que hab\u00eda sido el gobierno argentino el que -hasta ese momento- se hab\u00eda sistem\u00e1ticamente negado a negociar un marco jur\u00eddico de cooperaci\u00f3n en cuestiones judiciales, insistiendo en imponer sus decisiones unilaterales (Carta del 28 de septiembre de 2010 dirigida al Presidente de la Asamblea General por el Representante Permanente de la Rep\u00fablica Isl\u00e1mica de Ir\u00e1n ante las\n/\\: ^f-RTO NISMA\nMinisterio P\u00fablico de la Naci\u00f3n\triscAL; \u25a0-\nNaciones Unidas, Mohammad Khazaee). En suma, este \u00faltimo ofrecimiento de la Dra. Fern\u00e1ndez qued\u00f3 trunco por una nueva respuesta de Teher\u00e1n, tan falsa como provocativa.\nHasta aqu\u00ed, se ha demostrado la consistencia que durante a\u00f1os tuvo la postura oficial argentina en torno al caso AMIA, durante todo el gobierno de N\u00e9stor Kirchner y parte del mandato de Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez, hasta que, como se ver\u00e1 a continuaci\u00f3n, tuvo lugar un cambio radical en la pol\u00edtica del gobierno nacional vinculado -y as\u00ed se sostiene en la presente denuncia- a la decisi\u00f3n de la Sra. Presidente, instrumentada especialmente por su Canciller H\u00e9ctor Marcos Timerman, juntamente con terceros, de avanzar en un plan encubridor que permita a los imputados de nacionalidad iran\u00ed eludir y/o sustraerse de la acci\u00f3n de la justicia, a efectos de facilitar un acercamiento geolpol\u00edtico e intercambios comerciales a nivel estatal con la Rep\u00fablica Isl\u00e1mica de Ir\u00e1n, siendo \u00e9stos -a juzgar por la prueba reunida- los principales pero no los \u00fanicos motivos.\nDebe quedar claro que no se est\u00e1 cuestionando un cambio de pol\u00edtica exterior -resorte exclusivo del Poder Ejecutivo Nacional y por lo tanto, tema no judiciable-, sino que se denuncia que se haya optado lisa y llanamente por el camino del delito, para borrar una acusaci\u00f3n y una investigaci\u00f3n judicial en pleno tr\u00e1mite.\nIV.\t- El plan de encubrimiento de los imputados iran\u00edes en\nla causa AMIA\nLa Sra. Presidente de la Naci\u00f3n, Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez, decidi\u00f3 restablecer relaciones interestatales con Ir\u00e1n. Sab\u00eda que para hacerlo plenamente, sin restricciones, deb\u00eda encausar de alg\u00fan modo la causa AMIA, que estaba pendiente desde hace a\u00f1os, obstruyendo la agenda bilateral, en virtud de las capturas ordenadas, ratificadas y nunca concretadas. Para abordar y resolver este tema, la Dra. Fern\u00e1ndez, junto a su\nCanciller, H\u00e9ctor Timerman, orquestaron y ejecutaron un plan delictivo destinado a garantizar la impunidad definitiva de los acusados iran\u00edes, desvincul\u00e1ndolos fraudulentamente de la pesquisa, y redireccionando la investigaci\u00f3n hacia una pista falsa, con otros imputados.\nPara ello, mantuvieron negociaciones ocultas con representantes iran\u00edes, por m\u00e1s de un a\u00f1o y medio, a los que se sumaron otros cuatro meses de negociaciones oficiales. Estas tratativas culminaron en la firma del \u201cMemorando de Entendimiento\u201d, suscripto en enero de 2013, una pieza central del plan criminal, dado que sus disposiciones contienen distintos recursos y mecanismos aptos para viabilizar el encubrimiento, con la apariencia de legalidad que la maniobra requiere para ser efectiva.\nIr\u00e1n fue atra\u00eddo al plan, y as\u00ed se probar\u00e1 a continuaci\u00f3n, por la promesa del Ministro de Relaciones Exteriores argentino de permitir la baja de las notificaciones rojas que pesaban y pesan sobre cinco de sus nacionales. Ello, y as\u00ed lo indican varios elementos, fue acordado secretamente por Timerman y Salehi por fuera del texto del acuerdo. La frustraci\u00f3n de este objetivo, por la intervenci\u00f3n de terceros ajenos a la maniobra -Interpol-, desalent\u00f3 la predisposici\u00f3n iran\u00ed hacia el tema, sin que ello impeda el avance del plan criminal por parte de las autoridades argentinas denunciadas, que sigui\u00f3 operativo.\nPrecisamente, en este punto se analizar\u00e1 de forma completa, el plan de impunidad llevado adelante, que incluye: la decisi\u00f3n de encubrir, la predisposici\u00f3n de ciertas autoridades ejecutivas argentinas a abandonar el reclamo de justicia, la negociaci\u00f3n secreta con Ir\u00e1n y los intentos por mantenerla oculta, la negociaci\u00f3n p\u00fablica cuyo contenido tambi\u00e9n se mantuvo en secreto, el inter\u00e9s por el petr\u00f3leo iran\u00ed, las razones geopol\u00edticas de realineamiento con Teher\u00e1n, la prometida aquiescencia de Timerman para el cese de las notificaciones rojas, la existencia de compromisos secretos por fuera del Memorando y el armado de una falsa hip\u00f3tesis alternativa para desplazar las acusaciones judiciales contra los iran\u00edes.\nMinisterio P\u00fablico de la Naci\u00f3n \"^Tlberto nis^an\nFISCAL GENERAL\nAsimismo, se examinar\u00e1 en detalle el texto del Memorando de Entendimiento y se demostrar\u00e1 c\u00f3mo sus disposiciones viabilizan ciertos aspectos del plan criminal.\na)\tLa decisi\u00f3n de encubrir:\nNaturalmente, la decisi\u00f3n de la Presidente Fern\u00e1ndez de restablecer relaciones con la Rep\u00fablica Isl\u00e1mica de Ir\u00e1n no es cuestionable judicialmente. Aqu\u00ed no se denuncia ni es materia de cr\u00edtica el cambio en el enfoque pol\u00edtico de una cuesti\u00f3n por parte del gobierno o sus funcionarios, ni tampoco el giro en el modo de relacionarse intemacionalmente ante un conflicto y/o con otros estados. Ni siquiera se denuncia ni mucho menos se cuestiona el mero hecho de entablar negociaciones con la Rep\u00fablica Isl\u00e1mica de Ir\u00e1n en particular, ya sean comerciales o a\u00fan respecto a la causa AMIA. Est\u00e1 claro que todas estas cuestiones y acciones corresponden al \u00e1mbito exclusivo y excluyente del Poder Ejecutivo que, por ejercer la jefatura suprema de la Naci\u00f3n, la jefatura de gobierno y la administraci\u00f3n general del pa\u00eds, cuenta con la potestad constitucional de concluir y firmar tratados y celebrar negociaciones para el mantenimiento de las buenas relaciones con naciones extranjeras (art. 99 inc. 1 y 11 de la Constituci\u00f3n Nacional). Nada de esto est\u00e1 en discusi\u00f3n.\nLa decisi\u00f3n de poner en marcha una negociaci\u00f3n con las autoridades iran\u00edes o el mismo hecho de arribar a un acuerdo con ese gobierno, constituyen -en principio- la concreci\u00f3n de una estrategia y de una acci\u00f3n de pol\u00edtica exterior de car\u00e1cter discrecional y de exclusivo resorte del \u00f3rgano ejecutivo, cuyo ejercicio escapa al control judicial.\nAhora, si bien es cierto que la materia, oportunidad y conveniencia de lo actuado resulta ajena al conocimiento de los jueces, el Poder Judicial se encuentra obligado a intervenir cuando la ejecuci\u00f3n de ciertos actos, a\u00fan dentro de las competencias asignadas constitucionalmente, conlleve la comisi\u00f3n de delitos. En otras palabras, si la negociaci\u00f3n solamente hubiera excedido los l\u00edmites constitucionales en raz\u00f3n a la competencia de los poderes del estado, alcanzar\u00eda con la sanci\u00f3n de inconstitucionalidad. Pero aqu\u00ed hay algo m\u00e1s serio. Se trata de una acci\u00f3n que no solamente es inconstitucional, sino delictiva, toda vez que los actos realizados, destinados a encubrir a los imputados por este atentado, configuran conductas reprimidas por el derecho penal argentino.\nEn consecuencia, detr\u00e1s de un objetivo que puede considerarse leg\u00edtimo, como el restablecimiento de relaciones plenas y comerciales con Ir\u00e1n, y m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de que hayan sido las autoridades competentes las que intervinieron en el acercamiento, resulta penalmente cuestionable suprimir mediante maniobras delictivas el objetivo de alcanzar la justicia en el atentado m\u00e1s sangriento perpetrado en territorio argentino.\nEl momento en que la Sra. Presidente tom\u00f3 la determinaci\u00f3n delictiva de ayudar a los imputados iran\u00edes a eludir la actuaci\u00f3n de la justicia debe situarse entre fines del mes de octubre de 2010 y el mes de enero de 2011. Varias razones convergen en ubicar temporalmente la decisi\u00f3n entre esas fechas.\nExisten dos hechos, datados en agosto y septiembre de 2010, que indican que hasta esas fechas, no se hab\u00edan registrado cambios en el rumbo de la pol\u00edtica argentina en tomo al caso AMIA, esto es, la decisi\u00f3n de encubrir a\u00fan no hab\u00eda sido tomada.\nEl primero de estos hechos tuvo lugar el d\u00eda 11 de agosto de\n2010,\tcuando el Ministro de Relaciones Exteriores Timerman mantuvo una reuni\u00f3n con la Secretaria de Estado de Estados Unidos. En esa ocasi\u00f3n, la Sra. Hillary Clinton destac\u00f3 la cooperaci\u00f3n mutua entre ambos pa\u00edses en la lucha contra el terrorismo y se\u00f1al\u00f3 que su naci\u00f3n apoyaba el reclamo de justicia argentino por los deplorables y tr\u00e1gicos atentados terroristas sufridos (Declaraciones de la Secretaria de Estado Hillary Rodham Clinton con el Ministro de Relaciones Exteriores de Argentina H\u00e9ctor Timerman, 11/08/2010, Departamento de Estado, Estados Unidos).\nLuego de la conferencia de prensa brindada junto a la Secretaria Clinton y consultado sobre la relaci\u00f3n con Ir\u00e1n, Timerman declar\u00f3: \u201ctenemos una situaci\u00f3n muy compleja.

No lo sab\u00eda ni Hillary Clinton ni la gente que investiga ac\u00e1. Ahora hay una conexi\u00f3n entre un atentado que se frustr\u00f3 en Estados Unidos y el de la AMIA...''''

Presidente se dirigi\u00f3 -tal como anualmente lo viene haciendo- a la Asamblea General de Naciones Unidas y, en relaci\u00f3n al tema AMIA, ofreci\u00f3 a la Rep\u00fablica Isl\u00e1mica de Ir\u00e1n la posibilidad de elegir, de com\u00fan acuerdo, un tercer pa\u00eds donde llevar a cabo el enjuiciamiento de los ciudadanos iran\u00edes acusados por el atentado, con la participaci\u00f3n de observadores internacionales (Discurso de Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez en la 65\u00b0 Asamblea General de la Organizaci\u00f3n de las Naciones Unidas, 24 de septiembre de 2010).\nLa respuesta de Ir\u00e1n a la propuesta argentina lleg\u00f3 cuatro d\u00edas despu\u00e9s. En una misiva dirigida al Presidente de la Asamblea General, el Representante Permanente de la Rep\u00fablica Isl\u00e1mica de Ir\u00e1n ante Naciones Unidas, Embajador Mohammad Khazaee, reiter\u00f3 -una vez m\u00e1s- la hist\u00f3rica postura de Ir\u00e1n en torno a este caso (Carta de fecha 28 de septiembre de 2010 dirigida al Presidente de la Asamblea General por el Representante Permanente de la Rep\u00fablica Isl\u00e1mica de Ir\u00e1n ante Naciones Unidas, Mohammad Khazaee, A/65/495, distribuida el 6/10/10).-\nEs decir, mientras las autoridades pol\u00edticas argentinas a\u00fan intentaban avanzar en su reclamo de justicia, quiz\u00e1s con un ofrecimiento menos ambicioso, la diplomacia iran\u00ed literalmente invert\u00eda el eje de la cuesti\u00f3n, en l\u00ednea con su hist\u00f3rica ret\u00f3rica, acusando a la Argentina de no querer cooperar y de apoyar al terrorismo.\nHasta ese momento, no se observaron hechos ni indicios de peso que permitan sospechar que, solapadamente, ya se hab\u00eda decidido y avanzado en el plan de impunidad.\nEl 27 de octubre de 2010 falleci\u00f3 el ex Presidente N\u00e9stor Kirchner. El dato no es anecd\u00f3tico. Se ha consignado para hacer notar que en un momento casi contempor\u00e1neo a este hecho, la causa AMIA dej\u00f3 de ser una \u201cpol\u00edtica de estado\u201d para convertirse en un fusible de ajuste. Una pieza descartable. Y lo grave del caso es que para ello altos funcionarios del gobierno argentino, entre otros part\u00edcipes, recurrieron a conductas delictivas.\nALBERTO NISMAN FISCAL GENERAL\na. 1 ) La cumbre de A lepo:\nEn efecto, el primer indicio conocido y relevante que reflej\u00f3 la decisi\u00f3n de avanzar con el plan encubridor aqu\u00ed denunciado se registr\u00f3 tan solo tres meses despu\u00e9s de la muerte de N\u00e9stor Kirchner. Sucedi\u00f3 en enero de 2011 cuando el canciller argentino se separ\u00f3 de la comitiva presidencial que acompa\u00f1aba a la Presidente Fern\u00e1ndez en una gira por Emiratos \u00c1rabes Unidos, Kuwait, Qatar y Turqu\u00eda, para desviarse a fin de asistir a unas reuniones en la Rep\u00fablica \u00c1rabe Siria (fs. 131.189/131.194; Eliaschev, Pepe, \u201cArgentina negocia con Ir\u00e1n dejar de lado la investigaci\u00f3n de los atentados\u201d, Diario Perfil, 26/03/2011, fs. 130911/130913).\nConcretamente, el 23 de enero de 2011, Timerman arrib\u00f3 a Damasco, donde se reuni\u00f3 con el canciller sirio Walid al-Mohalem.

Un art\u00edculo publicado por el periodista Jos\u00e9 Eliaschev informaba acerca de la reuni\u00f3n secreta y de distintas cuestiones relativas a la misma (Pepe Eliaschev, \u201cArgentina negocia con Ir\u00e1n dejar de lado la investigaci\u00f3n de los atentados\u201d, Diario Perfil, 26/03/2011, fs. 130.911/130.913). Esta primicia fue profundizada en una segunda nota, d\u00edas despu\u00e9s, en el mismo medio gr\u00e1fico (Pepe Eliaschev, \u201cPol\u00e9mica en torno a la negociaci\u00f3n secreta entre Argentina e Ir\u00e1n\u201d, Diario Perfil, 2/4/2011).\nBajo juramento, el Sr. Jos\u00e9 Ricardo Eliaschev declar\u00f3 haber accedido a una copia de un documento secreto redactado por el Ministro Salehi, y dirigido al entonces Presidente iran\u00ed Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, que narraba datos y conclusiones de ese encuentro. Fundamentalmente, como se analizar\u00e1 m\u00e1s adelante, Salehi inform\u00f3 a su presidente que el gobierno de Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez se encontraba dispuesto a suspender de hecho las investigaciones de los ataques terroristas sufridos en 1992 y en 1994, con tal de avanzar en el terreno comercial (fs. 131.189/131.194 y ver: Pepe Eliaschev, \u201cArgentina negocia con Ir\u00e1n dejar de lado la investigaci\u00f3n de los atentados\u201d, Diario Perfil, 26/03/2011, fs. 130.911/130.913 y Pepe Eliaschev, \u201cPol\u00e9mica en torno a la negociaci\u00f3n secreta entre Argentina e Ir\u00e1n\u201d, Diario Perfil, 2/4/2011).\nY\tcomo si estos elementos no fueran suficientes, el propio Al\u00ed Akbar Salehi reconoci\u00f3 posteriormente que las negociaciones con Timerman principiaron dos a\u00f1os antes de firmar el \u201cMemorando de Entendimiento\u201d, lo que literalmente ubica el inicio de las mismas en enero de 2011, esto es, justamente, para la reuni\u00f3n de Alepo. As\u00ed, las declaraciones del canciller iran\u00ed corroboran las pruebas aqu\u00ed se\u00f1aladas y zanjan toda duda sobre el momento en que se iniciaron las negociaciones (\u201cIr\u00e1n ratific\u00f3 su adhesi\u00f3n plena al memor\u00e1ndum con Argentina\u201d, P\u00e1gina 12, 12/2/13; \u201cFM: Ir\u00e1n, Argentina adhere to agreement on AMIA case\u201d, Ir\u00e1n Daily Brief, 14/2/13; \u201cEl Canciller de Ir\u00e1n dice que negoci\u00f3 durante dos a\u00f1os el acuerdo con Argentina\u201d, Clar\u00edn, 12/02/2013; \u201cSalehi: Ir\u00e1n Argentina adhere to agreement on AMIA case\u201d, IRNA, 12/02/2013).\nEn efecto, la secreta cumbre de Alepo fue llevada a cabo entre los cancilleres argentino e iran\u00ed, y el Presidente y el Canciller sirios no solo actuaron como \u201cintermediarios\u201d del acercamiento sino tambi\u00e9n como \u201cpantalla\u201d para mantener oculta la existencia de aquel contacto.\nPor todo lo expuesto, la cumbre de Alepo -sobre la base de la evidencia detallada- marca el primer indicio concreto y corroborado que da cuenta de la existencia de una decisi\u00f3n de los m\u00e1s altos funcionarios denunciados del gobierno argentino de abandonar la leg\u00edtima pretensi\u00f3n de enjuiciar a los acusados iran\u00edes judicialmente imputados por el caso AMIA para posibilitar, entre otros objetivos, intercambios comerciales directos a nivel estatal, aun cuando ello implicara desplegar un plan para encubrir a estos imputados. Seg\u00fan las pruebas halladas hasta el momento, aquella decisi\u00f3n fue comunicada secretamente a las autoridades iran\u00edes por el mism\u00edsimo canciller Timerman en Alepo en enero de 2011.\na.\t2) La predisposici\u00f3n a abandonar el reclamo de justicia por el caso AMIA:\nTanto secreto reflejaba la necesidad de esconder algo. Se pretend\u00eda ocultar la predisposici\u00f3n de la Dra. Fern\u00e1ndez a sacrificar el caso AMIA con tal de acercarse geopol\u00edticamente a Ir\u00e1n y avanzar en relaciones comerciales de Estado a Estado con Teher\u00e1n, tal como lo comunic\u00f3 el Canciller Timerman a su par iran\u00ed. As\u00ed surge del documento al que, bajo juramento, declar\u00f3 hacer accedido el Sr. Eliaschev, y mediante el cual Salehi inform\u00f3 de lo ocurrido en esa cumbre secreta al Presidente Ahmadinejad.\nEn efecto, el testigo Eliaschev declar\u00f3 que el citado instrumento secreto, redactado por el Ministro Salehi con posterioridad a la reuni\u00f3n de Alepo, ha circulado por las canciller\u00edas de varios pa\u00edses. En este reporte, se informaba que \u201c/a Argentina ya no est\u00e1 m\u00e1s interesada en\n\n\nALBERTO NISMa/ FISCAL GENERAL-'\nresolver aquellos dos atentados, pero que en cambio prefiere mejorar sus relaciones econ\u00f3micas con Ir\u00e1n\u201d. En otras palabras, el gobierno argentino hab\u00eda renunciado a llevar ante la justicia a los funcionarios iran\u00edes imputados y presentaba una expectativa por multiplicar los intercambios comerciales entre ambos pa\u00edses (fs. 131.189/131.194 y ver: Pepe Eliaschev, \u201cArgentina negocia con Ir\u00e1n dejar de lado la investigaci\u00f3n de los atentados\u201d, Diario Perfil, 26/03/2011, fs. 130.911/130.913 y Pepe Eliaschev, \u201cPol\u00e9mica en torno a la negociaci\u00f3n secreta entre Argentina e Ir\u00e1n\u201d, Diario Perfil, 2/4/2011).-\nA1 declarar ante el suscripto, el testigo aclar\u00f3 que \u201cla revelaci\u00f3n de las reuniones\u201d llegaron a sus manos en idioma ingl\u00e9s, no en farsi, y por constataciones propias, revest\u00edan total verosimilitud. Asimismo, precis\u00f3 que dicho informe conten\u00eda las recomendaciones del canciller al presidente de Ir\u00e1n (fs. 131.189/131.194).-\nTambi\u00e9n explic\u00f3 que el citado informe \u201cno se trata de un cable como se lo llama en la jerga period\u00edstica\u201d, sino que consiste en \u201cun informe de la canciller\u00eda iran\u00ed al presidente Ahmadinejad, un t\u00edpico 'paper' intergubernamental, donde el responsable de las relaciones exteriores del r\u00e9gimen de ese pa\u00eds le sugiere al presidente que en virtud de los elementos de juicio que maneja la canciller\u00eda iran\u00ed corresponde avanzar en un acuerdo importante con la Argentina por que... est\u00e1n dadas las condiciones para que los argentinos decidan dar vuelta de p\u00e1gina...\u201d (fs. 131.189/131.194).\nEst\u00e1 claro que ning\u00fan canciller cometer\u00eda la imprudencia de formular a su presidente tama\u00f1a aseveraci\u00f3n de no encontrarse completamente seguro de la informaci\u00f3n transmitida, lo que constituye una evidencia m\u00e1s que el canciller Timerman efectivamente comunic\u00f3 a Teher\u00e1n la predisposici\u00f3n a abandonar la investigaci\u00f3n judicial del caso AMIA. De all\u00ed, la conclusi\u00f3n iran\u00ed -volcada en el documento- sobre la exitosa estrategia de negar las acusaciones en su contra que, a la luz de lo ocurrido en Alepo, rend\u00eda sus frutos.\nEn este instrumento, la Canciller\u00eda persa concluy\u00f3 que si las acusaciones judiciales eran dejadas de lado, ambos pa\u00edses pod\u00edan encarar una nueva etapa vincular y destacaba lo propicio de esta oportunidad, dado el paso del tiempo, la poca relevancia de los casos en la opini\u00f3n p\u00fablica actual y, fundamentalmente, la conveniencia del rotundo cambio de postura del gobierno argentino. No obstante ello, los funcionarios iran\u00edes sab\u00edan que deb\u00edan operar asumiendo que el gobierno argentino jam\u00e1s podr\u00eda admitir p\u00fablicamente el retroceso que significaba este acercamiento y, menos a\u00fan, la predisposici\u00f3n a dejar de lado el hist\u00f3rico reclamo.\nAhora bien, todos los hechos y verificaciones posteriores no hacen m\u00e1s que darle la raz\u00f3n a lo expresado por el Sr. Eliaschev. Las circunstancias constatadas desde entonces ratifican lo expresado por el testigo en relaci\u00f3n con el documento al que tuvo acceso. Tan es esto as\u00ed que, justamente, la firma del Memorando de Entendimiento entre ambos pa\u00edses es la expresi\u00f3n final de lo que anticipaba el \u201cpaper\u201d de Salehi. Las m\u00e1s altas autoridades del gobierno argentino estaban dispuestas a dejar de lado su propio reclamo de justicia en beneficio de extranjeros pr\u00f3fugos.\nEl acuerdo conduce a la impunidad de los acusados iran\u00edes. Por un lado, se previo expresamente la incorporaci\u00f3n en su letra de mecanismos sumamente intrincados que pudieran tornar inaplicable el convenio, como un modo de garantizar la impunidad. Por otro y ante su eventual implementaci\u00f3n, se previo la actuaci\u00f3n de la \u201cComisi\u00f3n de la Verdad\u201d, cuyas conclusiones ya estaban acordadas de antemano y, como surge de la prueba, ser\u00eda la v\u00eda para introducir una nueva hip\u00f3tesis sobre el atentado, falsa pero veros\u00edmil, destinada a desincriminar definitivamente a los imputados iran\u00edes.\nEn suma, las pruebas revelan que existi\u00f3 una iniciativa secreta de ciertas autoridades pol\u00edticas argentinas destinada a negociar un pacto con Ir\u00e1n para \u201colvidar\u201d los atentados y reactivar el intercambio comercial a nivel estatal. Tambi\u00e9n ponen al descubierto que esta cuesti\u00f3n no pod\u00eda ser articulada en forma p\u00fablica, es decir, los funcionarios argentinos no pod\u00edan reconocer ni sostener semejante decisi\u00f3n ante la ciudadan\u00eda. Teher\u00e1n lo\n\nALBERTO NIS\n\nMinisterio P\u00fablico de la Naci\u00f3n\nentend\u00eda. Hab\u00eda que encontrar, entonces, una forma solapada de poder articular estos intereses. Esto llevar\u00eda, eventualmente, a la peculiar redacci\u00f3n del Memorando de Entendimiento firmado a principios de 2013, que no es m\u00e1s que un instrumento y uno de los medios a trav\u00e9s de los cuales se lograr\u00eda la impunidad.\na.\t3) Indicios de la negociaci\u00f3n secreta.\nA partir de enero de 2011 y hasta fines de septiembre de 2012 los funcionarios argentinos e iran\u00edes negociaron en secreto un acuerdo para destruir las imputaciones de la causa AMIA y brindar impunidad a los pr\u00f3fugos iran\u00edes.\nNo obstante el empe\u00f1oso intento para mantener ocultas estas maniobras delictivas, surgi\u00f3 a la luz informaci\u00f3n y tuvieron lugar episodios que evidenciaron la gestaci\u00f3n y el crecimiento del plan criminal, durante ese a\u00f1o y medio de encuentros secretos.\nSe trata de situaciones de conocimiento p\u00fablico que, examinadas de forma aislada no revelan su verdadero significado, pero que analizadas en conjunto, concatenadamente y a la luz del plan de encubrimiento aqu\u00ed denunciado cobran su real dimensi\u00f3n, en cuanto demuestran el progreso en el camino del delito as\u00ed como la cimentaci\u00f3n del terreno para hacer p\u00fablico el acercamiento bilateral en el momento m\u00e1s propicio.\nCabe aclarar que, si bien no se trata de acciones delictivas per se, estas circunstancias deben ser le\u00eddas como manifestaciones que hoy evidencian con claridad el plan delictivo que subrepticiamente se estaba llevando a cabo. Y esa es la \u00fanica relevancia jur\u00eddico-penal de las circunstancias que se mencionar\u00e1n a continuaci\u00f3n.\nEl primer indicio se revel\u00f3 en la reacci\u00f3n a la noticia publicada por Jos\u00e9 \u201cPepe\u201d Eliaschev en el diario Perfil. Cuando, en marzo de 2011, el periodista inform\u00f3 sobre la reuni\u00f3n en Alepo y sobre la decisi\u00f3n de abandonar las acciones judiciales para retomar intercambios comerciales, se\ngener\u00f3 un importante revuelo en la opini\u00f3n p\u00fablica e incluso dentro del gobierno de la Dra. Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez. La respuesta no se hizo esperar y estuvo directamente dirigida a desacreditar al portador de la informaci\u00f3n como una maniobra aviesa de deslegitimaci\u00f3n de la versi\u00f3n publicada.\nEn lugar de dar explicaciones que esclarecieran las graves implicancias del trascendido informativo, el Canciller Timerman en persona sali\u00f3 a cuestionar al Sr. Eliaschev, sosteniendo simplemente que los datos publicados eran falsos y ten\u00edan por objeto da\u00f1ar su casi contempor\u00e1nea visita a Israel. Expres\u00f3: \u201c...esa fue una informaci\u00f3n falsa, fue una operaci\u00f3n que se hizo en contra de mis relaciones, o sea de mi viaje a Israel ...Fue el oportunismo de un pseudo-periodista que no vacil\u00f3 en decir cualquier cosa con tal de ofenderme...'''\u2019 (\u201cBrutal cruce entre H\u00e9ctor Timerman y Pepe Eliaschev por el pacto con Ir\u00e1n\u201d, Ma\u00f1ana Sylvestre, Radio La Red y Diario Perfil, 20/4/11; el resaltado es propio). A todas luces, se trat\u00f3 de una torpe falacia \u201cad hominem\u201d, ya que nada dijo acerca de la reuni\u00f3n.\nSin embargo, fue la propia contraparte iran\u00ed la que termin\u00f3 por desmentir categ\u00f3ricamente al canciller Timerman. El Ministro Salehi, que hab\u00eda intervenido personalmente en el proceso de negociaci\u00f3n, reconoci\u00f3 p\u00fablicamente, en febrero de 2013, que las negociaciones hab\u00edan durado dos a\u00f1os.

Agreg\u00f3 que no se acord\u00f3 antes porque \u201ccomo nunca quer\u00edan involucrar a la justicia argentina, no hab\u00eda posibilidad de di\u00e1logo\u2019\u2019'\u2019 y, finalmente tuvo que reconocer llanamente que \u201chubo conversaciones,\nhubo mensajes\u201d.

Cabe destacar que el testigo Eliaschev declar\u00f3 bajo juramento de ley haber tenido ante su vista la copia del citado documento, explicando las circunstancias en las que accedi\u00f3 al mismo. Estas cr\u00edticas a la prensa marcaron el inter\u00e9s por mantener estas negociaciones en la oscuridad. Y no ser\u00eda la \u00fanica vez que el Canciller, para desacreditar fuentes en el marco de este plan criminal, en lugar de controvertir los hechos narrados, recurri\u00f3 al cuestionamiento de quienes comunicaron las circunstancias que el ministro prefer\u00eda ocultar, como ocurri\u00f3 con las declaraciones del ex Vice Canciller Roberto Garc\u00eda Morit\u00e1n.\nL\u00f3gicamente el funcionario argentino no pod\u00eda admitir p\u00fablicamente que se hab\u00eda renunciado al reclamo de justicia por el caso AMIA para habilitar un acercamiento comercial con la Rep\u00fablica Isl\u00e1mica de Ir\u00e1n.\nEl segundo indicio tuvo lugar en la v\u00edspera del 17\u00b0 aniversario del atentado contra la sede de la AMIA, cuando la prensa persa inform\u00f3 sobre un comunicado de la canciller\u00eda de ese pa\u00eds, fechado en 16 de julio de\n2011,\tmediante el cual manifest\u00f3 estar \u201cdispuesta a un di\u00e1logo constructivo'1'' y \u201ca cooperar con el gobierno Argentino para que se haga toda la luz en el marco de la ley y del respeto mutuo para ayudar a evitar que la investigaci\u00f3n judicial contin\u00fae por un camino errado\u201d. Seg\u00fan los trascendidos, el gobierno iran\u00ed hab\u00eda expresado su indignaci\u00f3n \u201cpor el hecho de que la b\u00fasqueda de la verdad sobre la acci\u00f3n criminal se haya convertido en objeto de conjuras y juegos pol\u00edticos\u201d destinado a implicar a Ir\u00e1n, \u201cpara desviar el proceso judicial de su camino e impedir que los verdaderos responsables de este crimen caigan en manos de la justicia\u201d.\nAgreg\u00f3 que \u201cLa Canciller\u00eda de Ir\u00e1n expresa tambi\u00e9n su malestar por la continuaci\u00f3n de estos hechos por quienes han venido actuando en el Poder Judicial argentino desde aquella \u00e9poca\u201d.

De un d\u00eda para el otro Ir\u00e1n se dec\u00eda dispuesto a cooperar sin motivo o raz\u00f3n alguna que justifique dicho paso. Hoy se comprende que se trataba de un gesto expresado en el marco de las negociaciones que se estaban llevando a cabo en forma secreta.\nEn respuesta a ello, el 17 de julio, la canciller\u00eda argentina emiti\u00f3 un comunicado por el que hac\u00eda saber que hab\u00eda tomado conocimiento, a trav\u00e9s de la prensa, del anuncio de la canciller\u00eda iran\u00ed y que esperaba \u201crecibir la comunicaci\u00f3n oficial de su par ir\u00e1n?\" en relaci\u00f3n con el ofrecimiento de cooperaci\u00f3n.

No estaba ofreciendo allanarse a los pedidos de cooperaci\u00f3n emanados de la justicia nacional ni mucho menos a detener a los pr\u00f3fugos que ha mantenido resguardados en su territorio, sino que se ofrec\u00eda a colaborar en el redireccionamiento de la investigaci\u00f3n hacia otra hip\u00f3tesis, en la que - obviamente- Ir\u00e1n no estuviera involucrado.\nLa respuesta del gobierno argentino no tom\u00f3 raz\u00f3n de esta circunstancia como as\u00ed tampoco de las palabras de descr\u00e9dito hacia la justicia nacional y nada objet\u00f3 al respecto. Al contrario, pareci\u00f3 apoyarlas de manera in\u00e9dita en ese entonces.\nDe hecho, a pesar de la elocuente descalificaci\u00f3n a la actuaci\u00f3n de la justicia argentina, y lejos de exigir -como otrora lo hiciera la canciller\u00eda de nuestro pa\u00eds ante este tipo de expresiones- rectificaci\u00f3n por la implicancia de lo dicho, el Canciller Timerman manifest\u00f3 que la propuesta \u201cser\u00eda un avance in\u00e9dito y muy positivo\u201d (Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto, Informaci\u00f3n de Prensa N\u00b0336/ll, 17/07/2011). Hoy queda evidenciado que se estaba preparando el terreno para el encubrimiento de un crimen de lesa humanidad.\nY\tcorresponde agregar aqu\u00ed una reflexi\u00f3n: \u00bfqu\u00e9 sucedi\u00f3 con aquel ofrecimiento de cooperaci\u00f3n de Ir\u00e1n? Previsiblemente, nada. Qued\u00f3 simplemente en palabras vac\u00edas, como siempre ha ocurrido con Ir\u00e1n en esta causa.\nDebe hacerse notar, adem\u00e1s, que a prop\u00f3sito de aquella oferta iran\u00ed, la Unidad Fiscal que el suscripto dirige reenvi\u00f3 dos nuevos exhortos a la Rep\u00fablica Isl\u00e1mica de Ir\u00e1n consignando en su texto el ofrecimiento de colaboraci\u00f3n de las autoridades iran\u00edes como una manera de capitalizar en beneficio de la investigaci\u00f3n la declamada predisposici\u00f3n a cooperar. Nunca los respondieron (fs. 1179 del Legajo 415 y fs. 6416 del Legajo 392).\nLamentablemente, ahora se constata que todo se trat\u00f3 de una puesta en escena para seguir avanzando con el plan de impunidad que en aquellos tiempos se gestaba.\nEl tercer indicio ocurri\u00f3 dos meses m\u00e1s tarde, en ocasi\u00f3n de la apertura de la 66\u00b0 Asamblea General de las Naciones Unidas, el 22 septiembre del a\u00f1o 2011. Por primera vez desde 2009, la Sra. Presidente instruy\u00f3 al entonces Embajador argentino ante dicha organizaci\u00f3n, Jorge Arg\u00fcello, para que permanezca en su asiento mientras pronunciaba su discurso el, en aquel tiempo, Presidente de la Rep\u00fablica Isl\u00e1mica, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Ello, en contraste con la decisi\u00f3n sostenida por la mandataria en los a\u00f1os previos, de retirar a la delegaci\u00f3n argentina del piso y no presenciar los discursos de Ahmadinejad (\u201cLa AMIA reclam\u00f3 que la delegaci\u00f3n argentina abandone la ONU cuando hable el presidente de Ir\u00e1n\u201d, La Prensa, 11/09/2012; Mindez, Leonardo, \u201cAMIA: Con otro gesto oficial se confirm\u00f3 el giro ante Ir\u00e1n\u201d, Clar\u00edn, 23/09/2011; Levinas, Gabriel, op.cit., pags. 173, 189, 208, 20 y 279). Semejante signo comunicacional resulta menos cr\u00edptico si se lo contextualiza en el marco de las negociaciones que estaban manteniendo secretamente ambos pa\u00edses.\nComo ya se sostuvo, no se cuestiona la decisi\u00f3n pol\u00edtica de la Sra. Presidente de ordenar al embajador argentino ante la ONU que permanezca en su asiento escuchando el discurso del primer mandatario iran\u00ed. Simplemente, es mencionado en este punto por tratarse de un indicio importante de la existencia de las negociaciones entonces secretas.\nEl cuarto indicio tuvo lugar, ya en el mes de septiembre de 2012, cuando -por primera vez en a\u00f1os- Presidencia de la Naci\u00f3n decidi\u00f3 no\n\n\nMinisterio P\u00fablico de la Naci\u00f3n\ninvitar a formar parte de la comitiva argentina que viaj\u00f3 a la 67a Asamblea General de Naciones Unidas a ninguno de los dirigentes comunitarios de las instituciones jud\u00edas locales. As\u00ed lo reconoci\u00f3 uno de ellos: \u201c...el \u00faltimo a\u00f1o no hemos sido invitados, lamentablemente. Y es cuando surge justamente la propuesta de esta mesa de di\u00e1logo por parte de la Presidenta de la Naci\u00f3n...\u201d (Borger, Guillermo. Versi\u00f3n taquigr\u00e1fica del plenario de comisiones en el Honorable Senado de la Naci\u00f3n del 13 de febrero de 2013). Este dato resulta sumamente llamativo si se tiene en cuenta que - justamente- en esa oportunidad, la Dra. Fern\u00e1ndez anunci\u00f3 oficialmente su decisi\u00f3n de \u201ciniciar\u201d un di\u00e1logo con Ir\u00e1n en torno al caso AMIA.\nLa existencia de negociaciones y acuerdos previos con Ir\u00e1n y el conocimiento anticipado del anuncio que se har\u00eda, debieron motivar la decisi\u00f3n de no sumar a la dirigencia comunitaria jud\u00eda a la comitiva. Esto demuestra, como las dem\u00e1s pruebas lo corroboran, que la Sra. Presidente minti\u00f3 al sostener que en ese momento se iniciaban las negociaciones. No ser\u00eda la \u00fanica mentira ni la m\u00e1s grave.\nEs decir, durante el transcurso de las negociaciones secretas, de enero de 2011 a septiembre de 2012, existieron se\u00f1ales de cambio que, hoy se entiende, respond\u00edan al acercamiento entre funcionarios de ambos pa\u00edses y -fundamentalmente- al plan criminal que se hab\u00eda gestado, cuyo objetivo final era brindar impunidad a los acusados pr\u00f3fugos y vaciar de contenido la imputaci\u00f3n del suscripto y del Sr. Juez que obtuvo un fuerte y decisivo respaldo internacional en las sucesivas votaciones de Interpol.\nEn s\u00edntesis, pese a que las autoridades del gobierno argentino involucradas en el encubrimiento de los imputados iran\u00edes, con toda l\u00f3gica, intentaron mantener bajo estricto secreto las negociaciones que estaban llevando adelante con los funcionarios persas, fueron surgiendo a la luz varios indicios que claramente se erigieron en se\u00f1ales de la existencia de dichas tratativas.\nEn efecto, trascendi\u00f3 a la prensa la reuni\u00f3n secreta que H\u00e9ctor Timerman mantuvo en Alepo y el canciller argentino cuestion\u00f3 duramente al periodista que difundi\u00f3 la noticia. De un d\u00eda para el otro y sin\njustificativo alguno, en julio de 2011, Ir\u00e1n se declar\u00f3 dispuesto a negociar en relaci\u00f3n al atentado. El gobierno argentino presenciaba por intermedio de su embajador, despu\u00e9s de dos a\u00f1os, el discurso del Presidente Ahmadinejad ante la Asamblea General de las Naciones Unidas. La Presidente Fern\u00e1ndez no invit\u00f3 a las instituciones comunitarias jud\u00edas, como hab\u00eda sido su costumbre, a formar parte de la comitiva que la acompa\u00f1\u00f3 a la siguiente reuni\u00f3n anual de las Naciones Unidas y justamente, en esa oportunidad, anunci\u00f3 una negociaci\u00f3n con la Rep\u00fablica Isl\u00e1mica de Ir\u00e1n en relaci\u00f3n al ataque terrorista del 18 de julio de 1994. \u00bfPueden todos estos signos ser tomados simplemente como frutos de la casualidad? El sentido com\u00fan indica que no, pero son las pruebas a las que se ha accedido las que confirman que todos estos gestos se debieron al acercamiento secreto que hab\u00eda ocurrido entre las partes y cuyo objetivo final fue brindar impunidad a los acusados iran\u00edes pr\u00f3fugos.\na.\t4) Negociaci\u00f3n P\u00fablica.\nEl 25 de septiembre de 2012, la Sra. Presidente de la Naci\u00f3n, Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez, anunci\u00f3 ante la Asamblea General de Naciones Unidas que hab\u00eda instruido a su canciller H\u00e9ctor Timerman, para que inicie un proceso de negociaci\u00f3n con Ir\u00e1n en torno al caso AMIA.\nOficialmente se comunic\u00f3 que esta decisi\u00f3n respond\u00eda a un pedido articulado por Ir\u00e1n siete d\u00edas antes de la apertura del Debate General de la Asamblea General de Naciones Unidas (Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto de la Naci\u00f3n, Comunicado de Prensa N\u00b0302, 18/09/2012).\nSin embargo, como ya se prob\u00f3, los elementos aqu\u00ed obtenidos demuestran que eso fue solo una puesta en escena, dado que las partes estaban negociando desde hac\u00eda m\u00e1s de un a\u00f1o. Ello se desprende de lo analizado en los puntos anteriores. As\u00ed, \u201c...Cristina y su canciller solo estaban oficializando un hecho consumado...\u201d (Ver: Levinas, Gabriel, op cit, pag. 237).\nEllo tambi\u00e9n se sustenta tanto en lo testificado por el Sr. Eliaschev como en lo declarado p\u00fablicamente por el propio Canciller Salehi, que demuestra que el \u201cinicio\u201d de las negociaciones anunciado por la Dra. Fern\u00e1ndez y su Canciller en septiembre de 2012 fue sencillamente falso (\u201cIr\u00e1n ratific\u00f3 su adhesi\u00f3n plena al memor\u00e1ndum con Argentina\u201d, P\u00e1gina 12, 12/2/13; \u201cFM: Ir\u00e1n, Argentina adhere to agreement on AMIA case\u201d, Ir\u00e1n Daily Brief, 14/2/13; \u201cEl Canciller de Ir\u00e1n dice que negoci\u00f3 durante dos a\u00f1os el acuerdo con Argentina\u201d, Clar\u00edn, 12/02/2013; \u201cSalehi: Ir\u00e1n Argentina adhere to agreement on AMIA case\u201d, IRNA, 12/02/2013; fs. 131.189/131.194; Pepe Eliaschev, \u201cArgentina negocia con Ir\u00e1n dejar de lado la investigaci\u00f3n de los atentados\u201d, Diario Perfil, 26/03/2011, fs. 130.911/130.913; Pepe Eliaschev, \u201cPol\u00e9mica en torno a la negociaci\u00f3n secreta entre Argentina e Ir\u00e1n\u201d, Diario Perfil, 2/4/2011; Eliaschev, Pepe. \u201cLas condiciones que pone Ir\u00e1n para dialogar\u201d, Perfil, 23/7/11).\nPor otra parte, para el diario The Tehran Times, la negociaci\u00f3n entre Argentina e Ir\u00e1n hab\u00eda comenzado incluso un tiempo antes que la cumbre de Alepo, a mediados de 2010, a partir de una serie de reuniones secretas entre funcionarios de ambos gobiernos \u201c...parapreparar el terreno para la firma del memor\u00e1ndum de entendimiento...\u201d (Soroush, M. \u201cIr\u00e1n and Argentina deal a serious blow to zionists\u201d, Tehran Times, 23/02/2013; Levinas, Gabriel, op cit, pag. 238; \u201cLa prensa iran\u00ed afirma que la negociaci\u00f3n con Argentina empez\u00f3 en 2010\u201d, La Naci\u00f3n, 24/02/2013); circunstancia que tambi\u00e9n mencion\u00f3 el Sr. Eliaschev en sus notas period\u00edsticas (Pepe Eliaschev, \u201cArgentina negocia con Ir\u00e1n dejar de lado la investigaci\u00f3n de los atentados\u201d, Diario Perfil, 26/03/2011).\nAhora bien, lo cierto fue que el 25 de septiembre de 2012 en Naciones Unidas, la Dra. Fern\u00e1ndez decidi\u00f3 oficializar las negociaciones con la Rep\u00fablica Isl\u00e1mica de Ir\u00e1n. Naturalmente, nada dijo del a\u00f1o y medio de tratativas secretas que tuvieron lugar entre enero de 2011 y septiembre de 2012.\nLo que s\u00ed asever\u00f3 a las v\u00edctimas y a los familiares de las v\u00edctimas fue: \u201ctengan la certeza de que esta Presidenta no va a tomar ninguna resoluci\u00f3n respecto de ninguna propuesta que le sea formulada, sin consultar PREVIAMENTE con quienes han sido las v\u00edctimas directas de esto. Y, al mismo tiempo tambi\u00e9n, con las fuerzas pol\u00edticas con representaci\u00f3n parlamentaria en mi pa\u00eds, porque esto no lo puede decidir una sola fuerza pol\u00edtica...\u201d (Discurso de Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez ante la 67a Asamblea General de las Naciones Unidas, de fecha 25 de septiembre de\n2012,\tel resaltado es propio).\nSin embargo y pese a haberse comprometido p\u00fablicamente a consultarlos previo a tomar cualquier resoluci\u00f3n, nada de eso ocurri\u00f3 y luego de tres reuniones con los funcionarios iran\u00edes en Suiza, con fecha 27 de enero de 2013, se dio a conocer en Ad\u00eds Abeba, Reino de Etiop\u00eda, la suscripci\u00f3n del \u201cMemor\u00e1ndum de Entendimiento entre el Gobierno de la Rep\u00fablica Argentina y el Gobierno de la Rep\u00fablica Isl\u00e1mica de Ir\u00e1n sobre los temas vinculados al ataque terrorista a la sede de la AMIA en Buenos Aires el 18 de julio de 1994\u201d (Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto, Informaci\u00f3n para la Prensa N\u00b0 011/13, 27/01/2013).\nLa firma del acuerdo dej\u00f3 en evidencia que la Sra. Presidente falt\u00f3 a su palabra. M\u00e1s adelante se ver\u00e1 que esta promesa incumplida no es solo moralmente reprochable -lo cual no es relevante en t\u00e9rminos judiciales-, sino que -y esto s\u00ed importa- ha sido una acci\u00f3n especialmente destinada a contribuir con el avance del plan delictivo denunciado.\nLa Sra. Presidente comunic\u00f3 este acuerdo a trav\u00e9s de su cuenta oficial de \u201cTwitter\u201d, un d\u00eda domingo, coincidente con el \u201cD\u00eda Internacional de Conmemoraci\u00f3n en Memoria de las V\u00edctimas del Holocausto\u201d. Y al hacerlo, lo calific\u00f3 de un hecho \u201chist\u00f3rico\u201d (Mensajes de twitter de la cuenta de Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez del 27 de enero de 2013 de horas: 10:26 a 10:32).\nEn ese sentido, las autoridades de la AMIA hablaron de un \u201cmemorando inconsulto\u201d y se\u00f1alaron que: \u201cla propuesta aparece firmada, un hecho del que no hemos sido informados\u201d, \u201ceste memorando nos sorprende a toda la ciudadan\u00eda el pasado 27 de enero, jam\u00e1s fue consultado, ni siquiera comentado\u20191'1 (Borger, Guillermo en: \u201cLa AMIA\n\nAl BERTO MISM TiSCAL GENERAL\nadvirti\u00f3 un momento dif\u00edcil, tras el acuerdo entre Argentina e Ir\u00e1n\u201d, La Naci\u00f3n, 3/2/2013; \u201cPresidente de la AMIA prometi\u00f3 no bajar los brazos y se comprometi\u00f3 a evitar que la causa por el atentado causa en la nulidad\u201d, Agencia Jud\u00eda de Noticias, 4/3/2013).\nPor su parte, los representantes de la DAIA afirmaron haber tomado conocimiento del acuerdo en el mismo momento que el resto de la opini\u00f3n\tp\u00fablica y\taclararon que\tla instituci\u00f3n\tno fue\tconsultada\npreviamente ni particip\u00f3 de la redacci\u00f3n del documento (Schlosser, Julio en: \u201cLA DAIA reconoci\u00f3 que hay un resquemor en la comunidad jud\u00eda por el acuerdo que la Argentina firm\u00f3 con Ir\u00e1n\u201d, Itongadol, 4/2/2013).\nVolviendo al mes de septiembre de 2012 y luego del anuncio presidencial ante Naciones Unidas, la Canciller\u00eda Argentina y el Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores iran\u00ed emitieron un comunicado conjunto que - como se ver\u00e1- contribuy\u00f3 a amplificar la mentira presidencial. En ese informe,\tambos ministerios dec\u00edan\thaberse comprometido\ta explorar\nmecanismos legales que no estuvieran en contradicci\u00f3n con los sistemas legales de Argentina e Ir\u00e1n (Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto, Informaci\u00f3n para la Prensa 313/12, 27/09/2012).\nEs menester adelantar aqu\u00ed que el resultado de los encuentros diplom\u00e1ticos no respet\u00f3 precisamente el sistema legal argentino. Todo lo contrario, en consonancia con lo dictaminado oportunamente por la Unidad Fiscal a mi cargo, el Memorando de Entendimiento vulner\u00f3 la Constituci\u00f3n Nacional\ty normas\tinternacionales\tde Derechos\tHumanos de igual\njerarqu\u00eda.\tEllo fue\tsostenido en el\tfallo de la\tC\u00e1mara\tCriminal y\nCorreccional Federal de esta ciudad, que declar\u00f3 la inconstitucionalidad del pacto y de su ley aprobatoria (CCCF, Sala I, CFP 3184/2013/CA1 \u201cAMIA s/Amparo Ley 16.986, 15/05/2014, Juzgado N\u00b06- Secretar\u00eda N\u00b0ll). Es decir, en contraposici\u00f3n a lo anunciado, el canciller Timerman suscribi\u00f3 un instrumento jur\u00eddico en flagrante contradicci\u00f3n con el orden jur\u00eddico local.\nAclarado ello, cabe agregar que a aquel primer comunicado de prensa le siguieron otros, en los cuales la Canciller\u00eda daba cuenta de breves encuentros entre ambas partes, pero nada dec\u00eda en concreto sobre el contenido del di\u00e1logo ni sobre el alcance de las cuestiones negociadas (Comunicados de Prensa del Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto de fecha 27/9/12 - N\u00b0313/12; 29/10/12 -N\u00b0353/12-; 31/10/12 - N\u00b0360/12-; 1/12/12 - N\u00b0391/12; 7/1/13 - N\u00b0002/13-).\nHasta el d\u00eda de hoy, las autoridades argentinas no han brindado la m\u00e1s m\u00ednima informaci\u00f3n sobre lo negociado en esos encuentros.\nIncluso, ante el pedido articulado por el suscripto a solicitud de las instituciones querellantes AMIA (Asociaci\u00f3n Mutual Israelita Argentina) y DAIA (Delegaci\u00f3n de Asociaciones Israelitas Argentina), requiriendo informaci\u00f3n sobre los encuentros con Teher\u00e1n, la cartera de Timerman hizo saber \u201cque trat\u00e1ndose de un proceso de negociaci\u00f3n diplom\u00e1tica entre Estados las partes han acordado mantener reserva de su contenido mientras dure el mismo\u201d (oficio de fecha 5 de noviembre de 2012 glosado a fs. 132.805 y Nota N\u00b02194 fechada en 8 de noviembre de 2012 de la Carpeta DIAJU N\u00b07102/11, Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto).\nEn realidad, vali\u00e9ndose de las prerrogativas de secreto propias de la actividad diplom\u00e1tica, ocult\u00e1ndose detr\u00e1s de la confidencialidad que se le permite a ciertos encuentros, el Canciller Timerman mantuvo en reserva sus tratativas porque no estaba en condiciones de hacerlas p\u00fablicas. Se estaba negociando un encubrimiento y la publicidad y el control ciudadano era el mayor enemigo. Es un caso m\u00e1s de utilizaci\u00f3n dual de las funciones diplom\u00e1ticas para ocultar acciones delictivas destinadas a encubrir al terrorismo. No es nuevo para Teher\u00e1n ni, evidentemente, para los encubridores en esta maniobra delictiva.\nEn s\u00edntesis, tal como lo revelan los hechos aqu\u00ed enunciados, las tratativas sobre este tema fueron iniciadas en el mayor de los secretos, ocultas detr\u00e1s de intermediarios y reuniones \u201cpantalla\u201d, y as\u00ed se mantuvieron durante el siguiente a\u00f1o y medio, hasta que se anunci\u00f3 p\u00fablicamente el \u201cinicio\u201d del di\u00e1logo, cuyo contenido y alcance ha permanecido en reserva. Para impedir que trasciendan, primero la existencia de los contactos y despu\u00e9s, su contenido, se recurri\u00f3 a la negaci\u00f3n de los hechos, a su tergiversaci\u00f3n y hasta se lleg\u00f3 a cuestionar y desacreditar a las fuentes que brindaban informaci\u00f3n sobre el tema, como estrategia para impedir -de la forma que fuere necesaria- la verificaci\u00f3n de estas circunstancias, sin expedirse sobre los cuestionamientos realizados.\nEste fue el inicio del plan criminal. Luego se fue perdiendo todo formalismo, si se quiere, para adentrarse en una actividad y conjunto de hechos delictivos de los que la historia judicial argentina no debe registrar muchos antecedentes. Como se ver\u00e1, son la clara muestra de una impunidad y un uso arbitrario y delictivo del poder estatal pocas veces visto.\na)\tLos motivos del encubrimiento.\nAun cuando la configuraci\u00f3n del delito de encubrimiento no exija normativamente la acreditaci\u00f3n de los intereses que pudieron haber motivado al sujeto activo a desplegar la conducta t\u00edpica, dada la sofisticaci\u00f3n que reviste este caso, es sumamente ilustrativo explayarse, seg\u00fan los indicios y elementos probatorios obtenidos, sobre aspectos de esta cuesti\u00f3n ya que, a criterio del suscripto, contribuyen a comprender acabadamente el plan criminal aqu\u00ed denunciado.\nQued\u00f3 ya acreditado que las autoridades argentinas decidieron que resultaba conveniente restablecer relaciones bilaterales plenas con la Rep\u00fablica Isl\u00e1mica de Ir\u00e1n. Se reitera que sobre ese punto, nada hay para discutir pues, compartida o no, dicha decisi\u00f3n es propia del Poder Ejecutivo y no es materia judiciable.\nPor otra parte, cabe aclarar que las razones de \u00edndole comercial que motivaron a las autoridades argentinas y dem\u00e1s part\u00edcipes, exaltadas por la severa crisis energ\u00e9tica, se desprenden de los elementos con que se cuenta y por ello, se las considera determinantes de las conductas que se denuncian, pero no \u00fanicas.\nTambi\u00e9n se cuenta con elementos probatorios que demuestran que existieron razones de \u00edndole geopol\u00edtica que motivaron el acercamiento con Teher\u00e1n. Seg\u00fan estas pruebas, se entendi\u00f3 que el actual escenario mundial favorec\u00eda la proximidad con Ir\u00e1n e impon\u00eda la necesidad de aniquilar la causa AMIA.\nPor lo dem\u00e1s, no se puede descartar que hayan existido otros motivos alternativos y complementarios a los aqu\u00ed constatados, que hayan contribuido tambi\u00e9n a impulsar la decisi\u00f3n y las maniobras de encubrimiento aqu\u00ed expuestas. En ese caso, la determinaci\u00f3n de estas razones concurrentes podr\u00e1 ser abordada en la investigaci\u00f3n aqu\u00ed propiciada.\nAhora bien, la Dra. Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez fue lo suficientemente sagaz para advertir, a priori, que esa decisi\u00f3n jam\u00e1s ser\u00eda tolerada pac\u00edficamente por la opini\u00f3n p\u00fablica argentina debido al pronunciamiento de la justicia nacional sobre la responsabilidad de funcionarios iran\u00edes en el atentado contra la sede de la AMIA.\nEs decir, acercarse y negociar con el gobierno de un pa\u00eds cuyos funcionarios y ex funcionarios est\u00e1n acusados de participar del m\u00e1s grave atentado perpetrado en territorio nacional, generar\u00eda una fuerte pol\u00e9mica si no se abordaba la cuesti\u00f3n pendiente en torno a la causa AMIA antes del inicio de las tratativas comerciales.\nPresente ello, el modo del que se vali\u00f3 la Sra. Presidente para zanjar esta cuesti\u00f3n espinosa resulta verdaderamente inexplicable y, lo que es central, delictivo. Decidi\u00f3, lisa y llanamente, obviar el problema. Opt\u00f3 entonces por desconocer lo decidido por la justicia y ordenar la ejecuci\u00f3n de un plan de encubrimiento que permita liberar a los pr\u00f3fugos iran\u00edes de toda sospecha, eximi\u00e9ndolos de responsabilidad penal y garantiz\u00e1ndoles impunidad para el futuro. Sin acusaci\u00f3n que entorpezca las relaciones, no habr\u00eda objeciones para avanzar en el terreno comercial a nivel estatal. Exist\u00eda, entonces, la necesidad de \u201clavarle la cara\u201d a Ir\u00e1n.\nCon esta idea en mente, se negoci\u00f3 secretamente un acuerdo de impunidad, aceptando dar de baja las notificaciones rojas de Interpol de los cinco imputados iran\u00edes y -como se ver\u00e1- construyendo, clandestinamente, una hip\u00f3tesis alternativa que se\u00f1alara nuevos y falsos acusados para desincriminar a los verdaderos culpables.\nEn ese camino, se realizaron negociaciones secretas y luego p\u00fablicas, se suscribi\u00f3 el Memorando de Entendimiento, se impuls\u00f3 velozmente su aprobaci\u00f3n en el Congreso Nacional; se minti\u00f3 a familiares y v\u00edctimas del atentado prometi\u00e9ndoles que ser\u00edan consultados sobre las propuestas esgrimidas en la negociaci\u00f3n; se destinaron agentes del servicio de inteligencia de la Presidencia de la Naci\u00f3n para que \u201cconstruyan\u201d una falsa pero veros\u00edmil hip\u00f3tesis alternativa a la obtenida judicialmente y basada en las pruebas del caso, recurriendo a un ex fiscal de la causa para que aporte su conocimiento; se estableci\u00f3 un canal de comunicaci\u00f3n paralelo con Teher\u00e1n; se articul\u00f3 una campa\u00f1a pol\u00edtica y medi\u00e1tica para desacreditar las imputaciones judiciales y se montaron verdaderas actuaciones para disimular el plan criminal. En s\u00edntesis, se realizaron un sinf\u00edn de conductas que, analizadas globalmente, reflejan tanto el dolo directo de los part\u00edcipes de esta maniobra delictiva como la minuciosidad con que el encubrimiento estuvo pensado y ejecutado.\na.\t1) Un encubrimiento peculiar\nLas pruebas acumuladas permiten concluir que el acercamiento que llev\u00f3 a la suscripci\u00f3n del memorando de entendimiento como medio para lograr impunidad, como as\u00ed tambi\u00e9n su constante impulso, no ha sido motorizado por Ir\u00e1n, sino que fueron las mencionadas autoridades argentinas las que han venido ejecutando, principalmente, este plan criminal. Esto, como ya se se\u00f1al\u00f3, marca una peculiaridad en la perpetraci\u00f3n del delito, dado que, aunque parezca irracional, este encubrimiento ha sido impulsado por el inter\u00e9s del encubridor, m\u00e1s que por el de los sujetos encubiertos.\nNo fueron las autoridades ni los pr\u00f3fugos iran\u00edes quienes cruzaron oc\u00e9anos y desiertos para llegar a la septentrional Alepo en Siria a negociar secretamente un pacto, ofreciendo impunidad, como se probar\u00e1 seguidamente.\nPor su parte, los hechos revelan que a las autoridades iran\u00edes solo les ha importado lograr el cese de las notificaciones rojas de Interpol que pesan sobre cinco de sus nacionales, personas de gran relevancia de la vida pol\u00edtica iran\u00ed. Hab\u00edan acusado recibo de la afrenta sufrida cuando el ex Ministro de Defensa, Ahmad Vahidi, debi\u00f3 abandonar territorio boliviano ante la presi\u00f3n generada por la vigencia de la notificaci\u00f3n roja en su contra (\u201cBolivia ech\u00f3 a Ministro de Defensa iran\u00ed acusado por atentado en la Argentina\u201d, Infobae.com, 31/5/2011; \u201cEvo expuls\u00f3 a un funcionario iran\u00ed\u201d, P\u00e1gina 12, 1/6/2011; \u201cBolivia pide disculpas a la Argentina y expulsa a Ministro de Defensa iran\u00ed\u201d, El mundo, 1/6/2011). Episodios como estos han obligado al r\u00e9gimen a dotar de inmunidad diplom\u00e1tica a cada uno de los pr\u00f3fugos en cada ocasi\u00f3n en que viajan al exterior.\nDe hecho, en mayo de este a\u00f1o, representantes de la Rep\u00fablica de Corea consultaron sobre las implicancias de una posible invitaci\u00f3n al imputado Mohsen Rezai para que visite dicho pa\u00eds, por lo que se dispuso comunicar inmediatamente a Interpol que, en caso de concretarse la visita, se haga efectiva la orden de captura internacional, con notificaci\u00f3n roja, que pesa sobre el nombrado (Oficio del Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto del 9/05/2014, Nota n\u00b05572/14; Oficio al Jefe del Departamento Interpol de la Polic\u00eda Federal Argentina fechado en 12/5/2014).\nEsto demuestra que, como se dijo, si bien las notificaciones rojas no han conseguido -por el momento- la detenci\u00f3n de los imputados, claramente los afectan, dado que contin\u00faan siendo un obst\u00e1culo que dificulta su movilidad transnacional.\nPor lo dem\u00e1s, el inter\u00e9s iran\u00ed en torno a la ratificaci\u00f3n del acuerdo desapareci\u00f3 al no caer las notificaciones rojas, como se hab\u00eda convenido. N\u00f3tese que con fecha 10 de marzo de 2013, el Memorando de Entendimiento fue elevado al Parlamento de Ir\u00e1n para su convalidaci\u00f3n. Una semana despu\u00e9s, el d\u00eda 15 de marzo, Interpol garantiz\u00f3 la estabilidad de las notificaciones rojas. Al d\u00eda siguiente, el Canciller Salehi expres\u00f3 p\u00fablicamente su disconformidad con lo resuelto por la Organizaci\u00f3n Internacional de Polic\u00eda Criminal, al aclarar que, conforme lo convenido,\n_ju\u00c1\nALBERTO NISMAjfi FISCAL GENERAL\ncon la sola firma del acuerdo, Interpol deb\u00eda hacer cesar las notificaciones rojas. La consecuencia de dicho rev\u00e9s desalentador para Ir\u00e1n fue que el tratado nunca recibi\u00f3 tratamiento parlamentario y pareci\u00f3 quedar fuera de la agenda legislativa iran\u00ed.

Las conversaciones interceptadas entre los reales negociadores de ambos estados as\u00ed lo acreditan.\na.\t2) Pruebas del inter\u00e9s por restablecer relaciones comerciales de Estado a Estado\nExisten numerosas evidencias que demuestran que un fuerte inter\u00e9s subyacente a las probadas acciones criminales direccionadas a garantizar impunidad era, como ya se anunci\u00f3; restablecer relaciones comerciales al nivel de los estados, como una salida a la grave crisis energ\u00e9tica nacional. De hecho, las intervenciones telef\u00f3nicas dispuestas judicialmente han permitido conocer y probar estas circunstancias, dado que estos temas fueron tratados a trav\u00e9s de los canales paralelos de comunicaci\u00f3n y negociaci\u00f3n establecidos con Teher\u00e1n, para avanzar con el plan encubridor.\nPrimero. Antes de la firma del acuerdo, cuando nada se sab\u00eda de lo que se estaba negociando en Suiza, Fernando Esteche, part\u00edcipe de esta maniobra, l\u00edder del grupo \u201cQuebracho\u201d, hist\u00f3rico defensor del r\u00e9gimen iran\u00ed y allegado a funcionarios del gobierno nacional, asever\u00f3: \u201c...los tipos quieren restablecer relaciones ...que lo van a hacer... multidimensionalmente eso. A nivel gobierno, te digo, a nivel Estado...lo que tiene que ver con establecer relaciones entre los dos Estados...\u201d (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 18/12/12, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-\n2012-\t12-18-183332-8, CD 226). Los part\u00edcipes del plan estaban al tanto de los intereses subyacentes al acuerdo. Adem\u00e1s se evidencia que personajes locales hist\u00f3rica y fuertemente ligados a la Rep\u00fablica Isl\u00e1mica de Ir\u00e1n, y que, al mismo tiempo, poseen estrechos v\u00ednculos con funcionarios del gobierno nacional, ya conoc\u00edan los intereses del acuerdo que viabiliza la impunidad de los pr\u00f3fugos iran\u00edes.\nSegundo. Un contacto de Jorge Khalil, el empresario iran\u00ed Heshmatollah Rahnema, tambi\u00e9n estaba al tanto del inter\u00e9s del gobierno argentino por comerciar con Ir\u00e1n. Por dicha raz\u00f3n, se comunic\u00f3 con Khalil para hacerle saber de su gesti\u00f3n ante la C\u00e1mara de Comercio de Teher\u00e1n, la cual ten\u00eda intenci\u00f3n de reunirse en Ir\u00e1n con representantes diplom\u00e1ticos argentinos, para abrir el camino a todas las empresas iran\u00edes, para que \u00e9stas comiencen a negociar con Argentina. Este pedido de acercamiento y reuni\u00f3n por parte de grupos econ\u00f3micos iran\u00edes hubiera sido impensado antes del acuerdo por AMIA. Nada tiene de malo el comercio, muy por el contrario, pero resulta delictivo que para viabilizarlo se desarticulen ilegalmente las acusaciones judiciales y se dote de impunidad a los pr\u00f3fugos iran\u00edes.\nSobre el particular Rahnema expres\u00f3: \u201c...yo ahora necesito a ver si hay una palanca a trav\u00e9s de D'El\u00eda...de Canciller\u00eda...de P\u00e9rsico ...de Fernando*\u2019... porque yo quiero llamar a la Embajada Argentina en Teher\u00e1n...porque la C\u00e1mara de Comercio de Teher\u00e1n quiere tener una reuni\u00f3n para abrir el camino que todas las empresas privadas directamente ...para llevarlo a la C\u00e1mara de Comercio de Teher\u00e1n, el agregado del negocio de Argentina que est\u00e1n en Teher\u00e1n...quer\u00eda llevarlo ah\u00ed, para hablar en la C\u00e1mara y la C\u00e1mara est\u00e1 muy interesada que las empresas privadas...empiezan a arrancar los negocios con Argentina... \u2019\u2019(Comunicaci\u00f3n del 14/05/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-05-14-125442-12, CD 0025).\nM\u00e1s all\u00e1 de que Rahnema planteaba un inter\u00e9s relativo a relaciones comerciales entre particulares, Khalil le explic\u00f3 que hab\u00eda transmitido estas inquietudes a Luis D'El\u00eda, quien, a su vez, se las hab\u00eda comunicado al Diputado Andr\u00e9s \u201cCuervo\u201d Larroque, quien lo hablar\u00eda con la Sra.

Seguidamente, hablaron de la posibilidad de que delegaciones de ambos pa\u00edses se reunieran en Caracas, en Beirut o en alguna zona del golfo -como hab\u00edan propuesto los iran\u00edes- para restablecer las relaciones comerciales de gobierno a gobierno. En palabras de Khalil: \u201c...Perfecto...si hay un verdadero inter\u00e9s para empezar y entablar las relaciones comerciales de gobierno a gobierno, con funcionario de gobierno de ac\u00e1, una delegaci\u00f3n de all\u00e1 viajar\u00eda o a Caracas o al Golfo o a Beirut mejor...o a alguna zona del golfo...para empezar las relaciones directas de funcionarios a funcionarios...\u201d, a lo cual D'El\u00eda le contest\u00f3, dado que su acompa\u00f1ante permaneci\u00f3 en silencio: \u201cBueno. Ok. Con lo que nosotros queremos... \u00bfno?\u201d, para, luego, terminar acordando (Comunicaciones del 15/05/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-05-15-100907-10, CD 26; Archivo B-1009-2013-05-15-101055-4, CD 26).\nEsos contactos ponen en evidencia que para D'El\u00eda, \u201cnosotros\u201d son ciertas autoridades gubernamentales argentinas, para las que opera y para Khalil, en el mismo contexto, \u201cnosotros\u201d es Ir\u00e1n. Fundamentalmente, queda claro el inter\u00e9s de las altas esferas locales por restablecer el comercio entre ambos Estados. Puede inferirse claramente que Jorge \u201cYussuf\u2019 Khalil est\u00e1 transmitiendo la respuesta de Ir\u00e1n a la solicitud argentina de negociar.\nCuarto. El evidente inter\u00e9s comercial que motoriz\u00f3 el plan de impunidad se comprueba de modo contundente en las comunicaciones telef\u00f3nicas registradas los d\u00edas 19 y 20 de mayo de 2013, que dan cuenta de la reuni\u00f3n entre Luis D'El\u00eda y el Ministro de Planificaci\u00f3n Federal, Inversi\u00f3n P\u00fablica y Servicios, Arquitecto Julio De Vido, llevada a cabo por orden de Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez. Adem\u00e1s, como se ver\u00e1 a continuaci\u00f3n, las propuestas comunicadas por el Ministro De Vido, a pedido de la Sra. Presidente, fueron posteriormente puestas a consideraci\u00f3n del pr\u00f3fugo iran\u00ed Mohsen Rabbani, quien dado su poder pol\u00edtico intervino indirectamente en las negociaciones con sus encubridores, participando del encubrimiento que lo tiene por beneficiario. Tan ins\u00f3lito como inaceptable.\nEl d\u00eda 19 de mayo, Luis D\u2019El\u00eda se comunic\u00f3 con Jorge \u201cYussuf\u2019 Khalil y le dijo: \u201cAh\u00ed habl\u00e9 con Julio....

Aqu\u00ed radica una de las razones por las que se firm\u00f3 semejante documento y la evidencia de que el acuerdo ha sido un medio para habilitar el comercio. 4) La reuni\u00f3n entre el Ministro De Vido y D\u2019El\u00eda, \u201c/a pidi\u00f3 la jefa \u201d, la primera interesada en que el plan de encubrimiento avance pues se trata de la llave que destraba el comercio. 5) El acuerdo secreto del canciller Timerman para dar de baja las notificaciones rojas de Interpol, su fracaso en las acciones destinadas a lograrlo y la consecuente frustraci\u00f3n iran\u00ed por la persistencia de las prioridades de b\u00fasqueda policial.\nM\u00e1s tarde, ese mismo d\u00eda, Jorge Khalil inform\u00f3 a Ir\u00e1n del avance de las negociaciones.

El 18 de julio de 1994 ocurri\u00f3 un atentado terrorista en Buenos Aires. La justicia investig\u00f3 y determin\u00f3\nresponsabilidades de varios sujetos de nacionalidad iran\u00ed en la ideaci\u00f3n y planificaci\u00f3n de ese atentado. Esas personas han estado hasta la actualidad protegidas por el r\u00e9gimen al que pertenecen y que gobierna la Rep\u00fablica Isl\u00e1mica de Ir\u00e1n. El gobierno nacional negoci\u00f3 un acuerdo con ese pa\u00eds y, pasando por alto a la justicia y a la Constituci\u00f3n Nacional, brind\u00f3 el marco jur\u00eddico necesario para que aquellos acusados puedan quedar desvinculados fraudulentamente de la causa por el atentado e impunes. Y en ese contexto, uno de los pr\u00f3fugos de la justicia argentina y beneficiario del pacto ilegal, Mohsen Rabbani, envalentonado por la posici\u00f3n del gobierno argentino, en lugar de responder las serias acusaciones que se alzan en su contra, negocia su impunidad, decide los pasos a seguir, controla el avance del plan criminal y, adem\u00e1s, planifica \u201ccomprar armas\u201d. Es decir, en el marco de este acercamiento entre las partes, que garantiza la impunidad de los acusados, uno de los principales pr\u00f3fugos decide y negocia comprarle armas a nuestro pa\u00eds.\nEsta cadena de conversaciones es importante debido a que revela, por un lado, que quienes motorizaron el plan de encubrimiento fue un grupo de funcionarios argentinos y sus c\u00f3mplices. Demuestra tambi\u00e9n que Ir\u00e1n no necesitaba aprobar el Memorando de Entendimiento para negociar. Estaba dispuesto a comerciar de todos modos y as\u00ed lo manifest\u00f3 uno de sus m\u00e1s importantes representantes oficiales, el Ex Encargado de negocios en Argentina, Mohsen Baharvand expresando que estaban \u201clistos desde siempre \u201d.\nEsto \u00faltimo es central. Desde el primer momento la c\u00fapula del r\u00e9gimen iran\u00ed supo que para las autoridades argentinas imputadas en esta maniobra, era vital encaminar primero el Memorando de Entendimiento antes de avanzar con el intercambio comercial. Ese mensaje hab\u00eda llegado perfectamente a Teher\u00e1n.\nPor su parte, las autoridades iran\u00edes hab\u00edan expresado su hist\u00f3rico inter\u00e9s por comerciar. Les resultaba indiferente la aprobaci\u00f3n o no del Memorando de Entendimiento. No existen indicios que sustenten que la cuesti\u00f3n en torno a la causa AMIA fuera impedimento alguno para que\nTeher\u00e1n retomara los lazos comerciales con Buenos Aires. S\u00f3lo firmaron el Memorando de Entendimiento, por haber acordado que ello ser\u00eda suficiente para dar de baja las notificaciones rojas. No preocupaban las acusaciones de la justicia argentina, sino \u00fanicamente que sus funcionarios puedan circular irrestrictamente por el mundo.\nDe hecho, se\u00f1ales hist\u00f3ricas previas a estas acciones delictivas, dan cuenta de la siempre vigente intenci\u00f3n de Teher\u00e1n por comerciar con Buenos Aires. Ejemplo de ello, en el a\u00f1o 2007, tras una reuni\u00f3n con el entonces canciller iran\u00ed, Manuchehr Nottaki, D'El\u00eda -ya entonces activo part\u00edcipe de este entramado de contactos- anunci\u00f3 que Ir\u00e1n quer\u00eda reabrir la relaci\u00f3n comercial con Argentina (Obarrio, Mariano, \u201cD'El\u00eda prometi\u00f3 acercarse m\u00e1s a Ir\u00e1n\u201d, La Naci\u00f3n, 28/02/2007; \u201cCausa AMIA: Para D'El\u00eda, los acusados iran\u00edes van a ser sobrese\u00eddos\u201d, Infobae, 1/3/2013).\nAdem\u00e1s, una vez oficializadas las negociaciones entre ambos pa\u00edses en relaci\u00f3n a la causa AMIA, el entonces Presidente iran\u00ed declar\u00f3 p\u00fablicamente: \u201cEstoy seguro de que cuando las investigaciones tengan lugar de manera precisa e imparcial, a continuaci\u00f3n se avanzar\u00e1 en la ampliaci\u00f3n de las relaciones entre Ir\u00e1n y Argentina\u201d (\u201cAhmadinejad: Iran- Argentina transparent talks over AMIA leads to expansi\u00f3n of ties\u201d, Fars News, 2/10/2012). D\u00edas antes, en rueda de prensa, hab\u00eda aseverado que esperaba \u201csostener conversaciones tendientes a alcanzar la verdad\u2019 en relaci\u00f3n al caso. Dijo: \u201cAfortunadamente los argentinos han aceptado la propuesta. Tengo esperanza de que el di\u00e1logo entre los dos cancilleres pueda sentar las bases y una agenda para lograr este objetivo \u201d, agregando: \u201cQueremos expandir nuestras relaciones....\u201d (\u201cAhmadinejad dice que quiere 'expandir las relaciones' con la Argentina\u201d, Clar\u00edn, 26/09/2012).\nEstas expresiones por parte del presidente iran\u00ed en ejercicio en aquel momento, en el marco de las tratativas que estaban llev\u00e1ndose a cabo, remiten nuevamente a la ret\u00f3rica de deslegitimaci\u00f3n sobre la actuaci\u00f3n judicial argentina, sobre la necesidad de otra direcci\u00f3n en la pesquisa y - fundamentalmente- sobre el siempre vigente inter\u00e9s por comerciar.\n\n\nEstos son ejemplos que demuestran que la Rep\u00fablica Isl\u00e1mica de Ir\u00e1n estaba dispuesta a negociar sin necesidad de ratificar el Memorando de Entendimiento porque, a diferencia del gobierno argentino, nada ten\u00eda que explicar a su ciudadan\u00eda. De all\u00ed que su inter\u00e9s en la firma de ese documento, como se ver\u00e1, no estuvo centrado en el comercio entre Estados sino el cese de las notificaciones rojas de Interpol que pesan sobre sus funcionarios.\nUna vez m\u00e1s, corresponde aclarar que el comercio con Ir\u00e1n o con cualquier estado es, en s\u00ed mismo, perfectamente leg\u00edtimo. Delictivo es acordar la impunidad de un crimen de lesa humanidad, cualquiera fuera el motivo.\nEn suma, las pruebas demuestran la existencia de un manifiesto inter\u00e9s de la c\u00fapula del gobierno argentino por restablecer las relaciones comerciales con Ir\u00e1n -dada la severa crisis energ\u00e9tica nacional-, como as\u00ed tambi\u00e9n la urgente necesidad de borrar de un plumazo las acusaciones del caso AMIA para poder llevar adelante ese prop\u00f3sito. Aqu\u00ed radica, seg\u00fan la evidencia reunida, uno de los motivos -quiz\u00e1s el principal- de la Presidente para impulsar el plan de encubrimiento, cuya investigaci\u00f3n se propicia con la presente denuncia, para el juzgamiento y castigo de todos los que han tomado parte.\nAcl\u00e1rese una vez m\u00e1s que aqu\u00ed no se pone en tela de juicio la decisi\u00f3n de establecer relaciones comerciales con otras potencias extranjeras. Se conoce que dichas decisiones no son judiciables. Adem\u00e1s son, en su esencia, leg\u00edtimas. Lo que s\u00ed se cuestiona y se denuncia son las circunstancias que han tornado delictivo este cuadro de situaci\u00f3n, esto es, la decisi\u00f3n de encubrir a un conjunto de pr\u00f3fugos de la justicia argentina en un caso de terrorismo internacional como medio ilegal para resolver un conflicto bilateral nacido de una investigaci\u00f3n judicial, y as\u00ed habilitar, entre otras cosas, el comercio entre los pa\u00edses.\nSucede que las autoridades argentinas no han condicionado por capricho el restablecimiento de las tan anheladas relaciones comerciales con\nIr\u00e1n, a ciertos pasos en la ejecuci\u00f3n del plan encubridor. Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez estaba convencida que sin la aprobaci\u00f3n del Memorando de Entendimiento y, por ende, del encubrimiento, le hubiese resultado muy costoso avanzar en el terreno comercial.\nPor ello, como ya se asever\u00f3 y se prob\u00f3, se tom\u00f3 el camino de la mentira, el enga\u00f1o, la manipulaci\u00f3n y el delito. Se perge\u00f1\u00f3 un plan de encubrimiento y, en su parte p\u00fablica, se lo disfraz\u00f3 de negociaciones diplom\u00e1ticas y de tratado bilateral. Todo esto motiva la presente denuncia.\nb.\t3) Pruebas del inter\u00e9s geopol\u00edtico por alinearse con Ir\u00e1n\nEn paralelo al inter\u00e9s de la Dra. Fern\u00e1ndez y su Canciller por restablecer intercambios comerciales al nivel estatal con Ir\u00e1n, como paliativo para la severa crisis energ\u00e9tica, tambi\u00e9n se obtuvieron elementos probatorios que dan cuenta de una motivaci\u00f3n de \u00edndole geopol\u00edtica, que - seg\u00fan esas pruebas- contribuy\u00f3 a impulsar la decisi\u00f3n y la ejecuci\u00f3n del plan de impunidad aqu\u00ed denunciado.\nEn este sentido, resultan sustancialmente reveladoras las palabras de \u201cAlian\u201d, quien ha jugado un papel clave en el plan criminal, dada su vinculaci\u00f3n a la Secretar\u00eda de Inteligencia de Presidencia de la Naci\u00f3n y cercan\u00eda al entorno presidencial, y su activa relaci\u00f3n con el operador local de Teher\u00e1n, Jorge Khalil. Este individuo, que funcion\u00f3 como nexo entre distintos part\u00edcipes del plan y que contribuy\u00f3 activamente en la elaboraci\u00f3n de la pista falsa para redireccionar la investigaci\u00f3n, afirm\u00f3: \u201c...ya estamos en otro pa\u00eds, es otra situaci\u00f3n mundial y hay que trabajar en otro contexto...\u201d (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 01/06/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-06-01-224726-18, CD 43).\nCon esas palabras, alud\u00eda a que exist\u00eda un nuevo escenario geopol\u00edtico en el que ya no conven\u00eda sostener la enemistad con Ir\u00e1n, por lo que estos operadores, y as\u00ed lo dijo \u201cAlian\u201d, se vieron en la necesidad de \u201ctrabajar en otro contexto\u201d, para lo cual se plane\u00f3 que viniera \u201c...otra hip\u00f3tesis con otras pruebas...\u201d, que descolocara al suscripto, que lo dejara\nALBEBTONIS^AN\nFISCAL GENER\n\u201c...culo al norte, porque nunca las vio, \u00e9l, las pruebas...lo que viene ahora...\u201d (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 01/06/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-06-01-224726-18, CD 43). En una misma conversaci\u00f3n telef\u00f3nica, \u201cAlian\u201d explic\u00f3 esta \u00edntima ligaz\u00f3n entre la nueva situaci\u00f3n mundial y la necesidad de redireccionar la acusaci\u00f3n para desvincular definitiva y fraudulentamente a Ir\u00e1n.\nYa en noviembre de 2012, previo a la firma del pacto, los part\u00edcipes hablaban de la necesidad de \u201c...construir un nuevo enemigo de la AMIA, el nuevo responsable de la AMIA...\u201d, y del rol de los servicios de inteligencia en esa tarea (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 18/12/2012, abonado 11-3315- 6908, Archivo B-l 009-2012-12-18-183332-8, CD 226). Y las palabras de \u201cAlian\u201d explican que ello tambi\u00e9n se origin\u00f3 en un reposicionamiento geopol\u00edtico de la Argentina.\nNuevamente, cabe se\u00f1alar que las decisiones pol\u00edticas que hacen a la direcci\u00f3n de las relaciones exteriores de la Naci\u00f3n no est\u00e1n siendo analizadas ni cuestionadas en estas l\u00edneas. Solamente se las menciona porque, seg\u00fan las pruebas, revelan que el plan de impunidad tambi\u00e9n estuvo motorizado por razones de \u00edndole geopol\u00edtica. Pero como ya se dijo en relaci\u00f3n al inter\u00e9s comercial, es la decisi\u00f3n de dotar de impunidad a los pr\u00f3fugos iran\u00edes, y no tal o cual alineamiento internacional, lo que posee importancia jur\u00eddico-penal.\nPor lo dem\u00e1s, cabe se\u00f1alar que m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de los intereses comerciales y geopol\u00edticos constatados en el material probatorio obtenido hasta el momento, no se puede descartar que hayan existido otros motivos alternativos y complementarios que hayan contribuido tambi\u00e9n a impulsar la decisi\u00f3n y las maniobras de encubrimiento aqu\u00ed expuestas, los cuales podr\u00e1n ser determinados en el curso de la pesquisa que aqu\u00ed se propicia.\nb)\tMemorando de Entendimiento\nExplicada la decisi\u00f3n y los motivos de los encubridores para colocar intereses espurios y delictivos por encima de la justicia y la ley, se\nexplicar\u00e1 en este punto otro aspecto del plan de encubrimiento. El Memorando de Entendimiento ha sido concebido como el instrumento que contribuye m\u00e1s eficazmente a la consecuci\u00f3n del plan destinado a desvincular del caso y dotar de impunidad a un conjunto de imputados por el atentado contra la AMIA.\nSe advierte que este plan criminal se distingue por su sofisticaci\u00f3n. No se trata de alguien que ayuda a un pr\u00f3fugo ocult\u00e1ndolo circunstancialmente en su casa, para eludir a las agencias de seguridad en la persecuci\u00f3n. Aqu\u00ed se tom\u00f3 la decisi\u00f3n y se acord\u00f3 la impunidad de los imputados y, luego, se busc\u00f3 diagramar un modo de llevarlo adelante con visos de aparente legalidad, para hacerlo pasar por un acto leg\u00edtimo ante los ojos de la sociedad argentina, primero, y del mundo despu\u00e9s, insistiendo que el di\u00e1logo era el mejor mecanismo para solucionar los conflictos. El acuerdo deb\u00eda poder ser presentado como un instrumento pensado para procurar justicia, cuando -en realidad- estaba y est\u00e1 claramente destinado a lo contrario: a obstruirla y a impedirla. De all\u00ed la elaborada sofisticaci\u00f3n del delito denunciado.\nLa suscripci\u00f3n del Memorando de Entendimiento entre Argentina e Ir\u00e1n fue anunciado el 27 de enero de 2013 en Ad\u00eds Abeba, Reino de Etiop\u00eda. Tanto la Sra. Presidente como el Canciller Timerman lo presentaron como un \u201clogro hist\u00f3rico'1'\u2019 y, como reiterar\u00edan hasta el hartazgo, afirmaron que se trataba de una herramienta que facilitar\u00eda la cooperaci\u00f3n internacional, especialmente pensada para colaborar con la justicia argentina en la causa AMIA.\nEse mismo d\u00eda, Jorge Khalil, agente del r\u00e9gimen iran\u00ed en Buenos Aires y contacto personal del pr\u00f3fugo Mohsen Rabbani, celebraba: \u201c...este acuerdo...esta nueva relaci\u00f3n...esta nueva etapa...\u201d (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 27/01/13, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009- 2013-01-27-112032-4, CD 266).\nPero si el acuerdo, en teor\u00eda, hab\u00eda sido creado para contribuir con los requerimientos de la justicia argentina, si -como se dijo luego- se hab\u00eda logrado que Teher\u00e1n se allane y si -como tambi\u00e9n se dijo- esto\nMinisterio P\u00fablico de la Naci\u00f3n\tA!\tberto\tnism\nrlSCAL GENERA,.\nservir\u00eda para sentar a los pr\u00f3fugos ante el Juez de la causa: \u00bfqu\u00e9 es lo que festejaba Jorge Khalil, uno de los hombres de m\u00e1xima confianza de Mohsen Rabbani en Buenos Aires? \u00bfLa indagatoria de su jefe? \u00bfQu\u00e9 finalmente la justicia ten\u00eda un modo de obligarlo a comparecer, cuando \u00e9ste evit\u00f3 hacerlo por casi una d\u00e9cada, ampar\u00e1ndose en inmunidades diplom\u00e1ticas y en el territorio de Ir\u00e1n?\nSi el pacto ten\u00eda por \u00fanico norte lograr las indagatorias de los imputados, como se afirm\u00f3, \u00bfpor qu\u00e9 se negociaron en secreto intercambios comerciales por petr\u00f3leo? \u00bfY, en todo caso, por qu\u00e9 se neg\u00f3 que hubiera tratativas al respecto? \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 el Ministro De Vido se reuni\u00f3 y habl\u00f3 con Luis D'El\u00eda de este intercambio, a pedido de la Presidente Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez, si lo \u00fanico que importaba era asistir a la justicia?\nDe hecho, mientras se afirmaba que se pretend\u00eda contribuir al avance con la causa judicial, por detr\u00e1s, en el mayor de los secretos, sin que los sobrevivientes y los familiares de las v\u00edctimas supieran, sin que nadie supiera nada, \u00a1negociaban con el imputado Mohsen Rabbani por petr\u00f3leo y armas!\nAl d\u00eda siguiente de la firma del pacto, el sujeto identificado como \u201cAlian\u201d, part\u00edcipe de este encubrimiento, que responde a un sector de la Secretar\u00eda de Inteligencia y tiene acceso al entorno presidencial, llam\u00f3 - justamente- a Jorge Khalil y exultante dijo: \u201cTranquilo, ya ganamos, es decir, ganamos una partida, yo te dije, vos no me ten\u00edas feen clara alusi\u00f3n a la suscripci\u00f3n del acuerdo (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 28/01/13, abonado 11-315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2013-01-28-135732-18.wav, CD 267).\nNuevamente cabe preguntarse: \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 la firma de un acuerdo que te\u00f3ricamente pondr\u00eda a su jefe, Mohsen Rabbani, frente a la justicia que ven\u00eda eludiendo iba a tranquilizar y/o alegrar a Khalil? \u00bfQu\u00e9 parte de semejante escenario pod\u00eda ser considerado un triunfo por Khalil? \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 un agente de inteligencia argentino, como \u201cAlian\u201d, comparte los intereses con un agente org\u00e1nico del r\u00e9gimen iran\u00ed en la Argentina?\nLas circunstancias que se analizar\u00e1n en todo este ac\u00e1pite revelan, justamente, que Khalil ten\u00eda claros motivos para alegrarse, festejar y tranquilizarse ante la firma del \u201cMemorando de Entendimiento\u201d, porque significaba que se materializaba el plan de encubrimiento de Rabbani y de todos los otros acusados iran\u00edes. Y Khalil lo sab\u00eda, conoc\u00eda perfectamente que el documento que se hab\u00eda firmado era un simple camuflaje jur\u00eddico que escond\u00eda bajo una apariencia legal un pacto mucho m\u00e1s amplio, acordado de antemano, que beneficiaba a sus jefes, puesto que ten\u00eda la capacidad para desvincularlos definitivamente de las imputaciones que se les hab\u00edan hecho por su responsabilidad en el atentado contra la sede de la AMIA.\nEsta reflexi\u00f3n viene al caso pues en este punto se plantear\u00e1 justamente el rol que este acuerdo tiene en un plan delictivo mucho m\u00e1s amplio y del cual no es la \u00fanica ni la \u00faltima pieza, aunque -sin lugar a dudas- la m\u00e1s visible de todas.\nEn efecto, la vaguedad, ambig\u00fcedad e imprecisi\u00f3n de su texto ha permitido dotar de flexibilidad al plan, previendo distintos caminos hacia el encubrimiento y la impunidad de los imputados iran\u00edes. Estas disposiciones incluidas en un mismo texto son lo suficientemente vers\u00e1tiles para poder alternarse entre unas y otras o bien combinarse de acuerdo a las necesidades pol\u00edticas de quienes se encuentran involucrados en este plan.\nAs\u00ed, a priori, existen disposiciones en el texto que permiten encubrir a los acusados de distintas maneras: a) propiciando el cese de las notificaciones rojas de Interpol (punto 7); b) garantizando impunidad mediante la instauraci\u00f3n acordada de un procedimiento intrincado, infinito, que no conduce a nada y que solo diluye acusaciones y viabiliza desincriminaci\u00f3n, alternativa notablemente favorecida por la ausencia total de plazos que marquen la implementaci\u00f3n del acuerdo; y c) articulando, a trav\u00e9s de la \u201cComisi\u00f3n de la Verdad\u201d creada en el pacto, la desvinculaci\u00f3n total de los imputados respecto del atentado contra la AMIA, permitiendo redireccionar la pesquisa hacia otros autores e hip\u00f3tesis.\nEn fin, el documento contiene numerosos recursos y opciones para avanzar con el plan criminal, conforme lo exijan sus autores y\nMinisterio P\u00fablico de la Naci\u00f3n\tr\nFISCAL GENEriA\nejecutores, en virtud de la enorme cantidad de variables que operan en una maniobra de tama\u00f1a sofisticaci\u00f3n.\nc.\t1) Cese de las notificaciones rojas de Interpol. Inter\u00e9s de Ir\u00e1n\nDe los ocho\timputados de origen iran\u00ed\tcon pedido de captura\nnacional\te\tinternacional\tpor el caso AMIA, hay cinco que -como ya se\nexplic\u00f3 en la parte introductoria- tienen la m\u00e1xima prioridad de b\u00fasqueda por parte de Interpol (notificaciones rojas) y, cabe tener presente, estos sujetos ostentan un significativo peso en la escena pol\u00edtica iran\u00ed.\nLas pruebas\tobtenidas indican que han\texistido negociaciones\ny acuerdos\tprevios entre\tlas partes sobre el cese de\tlas notificaciones rojas\nde Interpol. En efecto, los elementos reunidos hasta el momento permiten concluir que la baja de las notificaciones rojas constituy\u00f3 el inter\u00e9s central para las autoridades iran\u00edes en este acuerdo y el Canciller Timerman acept\u00f3 y contribuy\u00f3 a ello. Hizo todo lo posible para que ese objetivo fuera cumplido por Interpol. M\u00e1s all\u00e1, claro est\u00e1, de sus declaraciones p\u00fablicas en sentido contrario, porque sostener la verdad, adem\u00e1s de confesar su participaci\u00f3n en el plan delictivo, hubiese sido incompatible con los reclamos de justicia en este expediente. La diligente y a la vez inesperada - para los encubridores- actitud de Interpol, espec\u00edficamente de su Secretario General, Ronald Noble, se lo impidi\u00f3.\nLa primera prueba que abona dicha afirmaci\u00f3n es la existencia del documento que describi\u00f3 el Sr. Jos\u00e9 Ricardo \u201cPepe\u201d Eliaschev en su declaraci\u00f3n testimonial. En el mismo, el Ministro Salehi propon\u00eda al Presidente Ahmadinejad, que lo autoricen a solicitar la revocaci\u00f3n de los pedidos de captura internacional con respaldo de Interpol, expresando un especial inter\u00e9s en mejorar la situaci\u00f3n procesal del entonces Ministro de Defensa Ahmad Vahidi, uno de los imputados con notificaci\u00f3n roja vigente (fs. 131.189/131.194; Eliaschev, Pepe, \u201cArgentina negocia con Ir\u00e1n dejar de lado la investigaci\u00f3n de los atentados\u201d, Diario Perfil, 26/03/2011, fs.\n130.911/130.913; Eliaschev, Pepe, \u201cPol\u00e9mica en torno a la negociaci\u00f3n secreta entre Argentina e Ir\u00e1n\u201d, Diario Perfil, 2/4/2011).\nNo est\u00e1 de m\u00e1s recordar que entre los d\u00edas 31 de mayo y 1 de junio de 2011, Bolivia hab\u00eda recibido al entonces Ministro de Defensa de Ir\u00e1n, Ahmad Vahidi, uno de los pr\u00f3fugos de la causa AMIA, haciendo caso omiso de la orden de captura internacional dictada por la justicia argentina y las notificaciones rojas de Interpol. Solo el repudio generalizado que desat\u00f3 este recibimiento forz\u00f3 al gobierno boliviano a expulsar al funcionario iran\u00ed (\u201cBolivia ech\u00f3 a Ministro de Defensa iran\u00ed acusado por atentado en la Argentina\u201d, Infobae.com, 31/5/2011; \u201cEvo expuls\u00f3 a un funcionario iran\u00ed\u201d, P\u00e1gina 12, 1/6/2011; \u201cBolivia pide disculpas a la Argentina y expulsa a Ministro de Defensa iran\u00ed\u201d, El mundo, 1/6/2011).\nBajo juramento el testigo Eliaschev asever\u00f3 que el documento que tuvo oportunidad de ver consist\u00eda en \u201cun informe de la canciller\u00eda iran\u00ed al presidente Ahmadinejad, un t\u00edpico \u2018paper\u2019 intergubernamental, donde el responsable de las relaciones exteriores del r\u00e9gimen de ese pa\u00eds le sugiere al presidente que en virtud de los elementos de juicio que maneja la canciller\u00eda iran\u00ed corresponde avanzar en un acuerdo importante con Argentina porque...est\u00e1n dadas las condiciones para que los argentinos decidan dar vuelta de p\u00e1gina... \u201d (fs. 131.189/131.194).\nComo ya se mencion\u00f3 al hablar de los ofrecimientos rechazados por N\u00e9stor Kirchner, existi\u00f3 un antecedente al pacto con Ir\u00e1n, del a\u00f1o 2006, que fue redactado por Fernando Esteche quien, junto con Jorge Khalil, lo hicieron llegar a las autoridades de ambos gobiernos.\nDe ello dan cuenta una serie de comunicaciones telef\u00f3nicas que han quedado judicialmente registradas: \u201c...lo \u00fanico que s\u00e9 que es el mismo documento que hicimos nosotros hace seis a\u00f1os y lo presentamos, tanto en la Embajada de Ir\u00e1n como a gente del gobierno... \u201d, \u201c...el mismo, boludo, el mismo pusieron...como lo dijimos nosotros ...todo como lo escribimos con Fernando hace seis a\u00f1os... \u201d, \u201c...el acuerdo que hicimos hace seis a\u00f1os nosotros con Fernando Esteche y nos trataron de locos a nosotros ...cuando lo planteamos, lo mismo, est\u00e1 escrito, hace seis, siete a\u00f1os, en el 2006...nos\ndijeron 'est\u00e1n locos, esto no tiene asidero\u2019...hoy lo sacaron... \u201d, \u201c...dec\u00edan que esto era imposible, que no se pod\u00eda hacer... \u201d, \"... \u00bfSabes quien me lo escribi\u00f3 a m\u00ed, ese d\u00eda, el memorando ese, qui\u00e9n lo escribi\u00f3?...Fernando... \u201d, en alusi\u00f3n a Esteche (Comunicaciones del 27/01/13, abonado N\u00b011-3315- 6908, Archivo B-1009-2013-01 -27-174637-12, CD 266; Archivo B-1009- 2013-01-27-112032-4, CD 266; Archivo B-1009-2013-01-27-112552-12, CD 266; Archivo B-1009-2013-01-27-113208-14, CD 266).\nEn esa oportunidad, Khalil hab\u00eda aclarado: \u201c...ese plan lo hicimos con Fernando Esteche hace seis a\u00f1os ...cuando se lo llev\u00e9 a Baharvand, me dijo no...\u201d (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 27/01/13, abonado N\u00b0ll- 3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2013-01-27-113208-14, CD 266). Es decir, que si bien Kirchner no lo hab\u00eda aceptado, tampoco hab\u00eda tenido acogida en Ir\u00e1n.\nHoy se puede concluir que el rechazo iran\u00ed se pudo deber a que, en aquella \u00e9poca, INTERPOL no hab\u00eda emitido a\u00fan las notificaciones rojas contra los funcionarios persas y, en consecuencia, no exist\u00eda el motivo que activ\u00f3 posteriormente el inter\u00e9s de Teher\u00e1n en avanzar con un acuerdo por el tema,\tconforme ha sido probado en esta\tpresentaci\u00f3n.\tSin\nnotificaciones rojas que desactivar, no hab\u00eda inter\u00e9s de Ir\u00e1n para firmar ning\u00fan acuerdo con Argentina.\nEsto implica que desde el inicio mismo de estas negociaciones, la parte iran\u00ed estaba especialmente interesada en\tdar de\tbaja\tlas\nnotificaciones\trojas de Interpol y ten\u00eda como norte\tfavorecer\tcon\tesa\nmedida a los\tcinco afectados, pero en particular, al\tentonces\tMinistro\nVahidi. De hecho, las pruebas no revelan otros intereses tan concretos por parte de Teher\u00e1n.\nLa disposici\u00f3n s\u00e9ptima del Memorando de Entendimiento fue el punto de partida para habilitar la baja de las notificaciones rojas de Interpol, es decir, el primer paso para garantizar la impunidad de los imputados.\nb.\tl.a) El punto s\u00e9ptimo, la vigencia de las notificaciones rojas y el consecuente desinter\u00e9s de Ir\u00e1n\nLa maniobra para dar de baja las notificaciones rojas de Interpol se tradujo con sutileza en el texto del acuerdo, precisamente en el punto 7o que establece: \u201cEste acuerdo, luego de ser firmado, ser\u00e1 remitido conjuntamente por ambos cancilleres al Secretario General de Interpol en cumplimiento a requisitos exigidos por Interpol con relaci\u00f3n a este caso\u201d. La falta de precisiones en el texto sobre la implicancia de la comunicaci\u00f3n prevista en esta disposici\u00f3n, cuya operatividad a sola firma -la \u00fanica de todo el acuerdo- y sin necesidad de ratificaci\u00f3n interna la distingue del resto del acuerdo, permiti\u00f3 esgrimir argumentos dirigidos a relativizar la razonable sospecha inmediata que despert\u00f3 este punto.\nAl conocerse el memorando, tanto la dirigencia comunitaria jud\u00eda local como grupos de familiares y v\u00edctimas del atentado, entre otros, expresaron su profunda preocupaci\u00f3n sobre la verdadera implicancia de esta comunicaci\u00f3n y su potencial letalidad respecto de las b\u00fasquedas prioritarias ordenadas por Interpol. En este sentido, se aleg\u00f3 que mediante esta comunicaci\u00f3n se estaban cumpliendo compromisos asumidos ante Interpol que son inexistentes. Nada se hab\u00eda acordado ni exist\u00eda compromiso alguno.\nDe hecho, agrupaciones de v\u00edctimas, familiares y entidades comunitarias intentaron que la canciller\u00eda argentina propicie un anexo al memorando de entendimiento donde se especifique -entre otras cosas- que su suscripci\u00f3n en nada afectar\u00eda a la vigencia de las notificaciones rojas. Como se ver\u00e1 m\u00e1s adelante, si bien primero trascendi\u00f3 que ello hab\u00eda sido acordado con Timerman, luego el Canciller neg\u00f3 haberse comprometido con familiares y dirigentes comunitarios a tramitar un anexo al acuerdo.\nEstaba claro que numerosos sectores sociales argentinos, guiados por conclusiones hermen\u00e9uticas surgidas del an\u00e1lisis de este punto 7 advirtieron que su aplicaci\u00f3n podr\u00eda derivar en el cese de las notificaciones rojas. Lo novedoso es que se han hallado pruebas que confirman esa sospecha. Ahora se encuentra probado que justamente el cese\n\n\nMinisterio P\u00fablico de la Naci\u00f3n\nde esas notificaciones fue uno de los puntos pactados secretamente por el Canciller Timerman por tratarse del inter\u00e9s principal de la contraparte iran\u00ed para firmar el acuerdo.\nLa prueba reveladora de que las expectativas iniciales de los firmantes del acuerdo eran que Interpol levante las capturas son las manifestaciones de quienes participaron activamente de las tratativas entre las autoridades argentinas e iran\u00edes, por canales paralelos y en secreto, y que -naturalmente- sab\u00edan de la existencia del acuerdo secreto de Timerman para el cese de las notificaciones rojas de Interpol.\nEn febrero de 2013, apenas un mes despu\u00e9s del acuerdo, hablando con el referente local de Ir\u00e1n Jorge \u201cYussuf\u2019 Khalil, \u201cAlian\u201d le confes\u00f3 que en la Secretar\u00eda de Inteligencia se comentaba que Interpol iba a levantar las notificaciones rojas que pesaban sobre los imputados iran\u00edes. En concreto, dijo: \u201cTengo un chisme...me dijeron ah\u00ed en la casa ...Interpol va a levantar el pedido de captura de los amigos...Lo va a levantar ahora \u201d. Khalil se alegr\u00f3: \u201c\u00a1No me digas! \u00a1Menos mal!\u201d (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 25/2/13, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2013-02-25-151137-12, CD 295).\nEl entonces Encargado de Negocios de Ir\u00e1n, Al\u00ed Pakdaman, ya le hab\u00eda avisado a Khalil, el mismo d\u00eda de la firma del acuerdo con Ir\u00e1n, que iba a tener mejores noticias a\u00fan. As\u00ed lo explic\u00f3 Khalil: \u201c...lo llam\u00e9 a Pakdaman...yo ya estaba al tanto, me dice. Son buenas noticias, me dice, y vas a tener mejores noticias todav\u00eda, me dijo. Reci\u00e9n, reci\u00e9n, hace un ratito...\u201d (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 27/01/2013, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2013-01-27-122441-28, CD 266). Esto contribuye a corroborar que el levantamiento de las notificaciones rojas form\u00f3 parte de la negociaci\u00f3n secreta.\nEn otras palabras, esa era la informaci\u00f3n que circulaba y, tal como hab\u00eda sido acordado por argentinos e iran\u00edes en la ejecuci\u00f3n del plan de impunidad y plasmado en el punto 7 de la letra del memorando, el cese de las notificaciones rojas asomaba como una posibilidad cierta.\nPor su parte, la interpretaci\u00f3n que Ir\u00e1n ten\u00eda del punto siete del acuerdo, resulta ser un elemento central para entender el verdadero significado del mismo. En ese sentido, un primer indicio surgi\u00f3 cuando la agencia oficial de noticias iran\u00ed (IRNA) public\u00f3 bajo el t\u00edtulo \u201cMemorando de Entendimiento firmado entre Ir\u00e1n y Argentina: Gran \u00e9xito diplom\u00e1tico\u201d, el an\u00e1lisis jur\u00eddico que del texto del acuerdo realiz\u00f3 el experto iran\u00ed en derecho internacional, Mohammad Hossein Mahdavi.\nEn ese documento, el jurista sostuvo: \u201cEl prop\u00f3sito del art\u00edculo , en realidad, era que las dos partes conjuntamente se\u00f1alaban a INTERPOL que la diferencia entre las dos partes por el caso AMIA, y que motiv\u00f3 que algunas personas aparezcan en la lista de alerta roja de esta organizaci\u00f3n, se hab\u00eda resuelto a trav\u00e9s de la cooperaci\u00f3n mutua, y por lo tanto, la INTERPOL pod\u00eda anular esta lista...\u201d (Mahdavi, Mohammad Hossein, \u201cMemorando de Entendimiento firmado entre Ir\u00e1n y Argentina: Gran \u00e9xito diplom\u00e1tico\u201d, IRNA, 7/2/2013).\nEsta interpretaci\u00f3n fue indiscutidamente refrendada por las declaraciones del propio Ministro Salehi -cofirmante del tratado- cuando, seg\u00fan inform\u00f3 la agencia de noticias IRNA, manifest\u00f3 que: \u201cseg\u00fan el acuerdo firmado por ambos pa\u00edses, la Interpol (Polic\u00eda Internacional) debe eliminar las acusaciones contra las autoridades iran\u00edes\u201d y critic\u00f3 a Interpol por haber aseverado que las mismas permanec\u00edan vigentes (IRNA, \u201cSalehi: Ir\u00e1n y Argentina trabajan conjuntamente para resolver las acusaciones sobre la AMIA\u201d, 18/03/2013; \u201cIr\u00e1n asegura que el acuerdo con Argentina incluye retirar las \u201cnotas rojas\u201d de Interpol\u201d, La Naci\u00f3n, 18 de marzo de 2013; \u201cTehran insists accord with Argentina includes Interpol lifting red notices against Iranian suspects\u201d, Mercopress, 19/03/2013).\nComo bien lo aclar\u00f3 el canciller iran\u00ed, se esperaba que aun sin entrar en vigencia, el acuerdo sirviera para dar de baja las notificaciones rojas de Interpol. Si \u00e9stas cayeran, ya nada llevar\u00eda a los sospechados a ponerse verdaderamente a disposici\u00f3n de la justicia argentina. Porque aunque las notificaciones rojas no han tenido la capacidad para obligar a los acusados iran\u00edes a comparecer ante el juez argentino, claramente se\nerigieron como el \u00fanico elemento que dificult\u00f3 la movilidad internacional de varios de los imputados, estorbando la total impunidad con la que se han conducido hasta ahora.\nAl respecto, cabe tener presente que en reiteradas ocasiones, esta Unidad Fiscal ha tomado conocimiento de viajes de los acusados al exterior, oportunidades en las que se arriesgaron a ser detenidos, en virtud de los pedidos de captura internacional y notificaciones rojas vigentes. Sin m\u00e1s, en mayo de este a\u00f1o, representantes de la Rep\u00fablica de Corea consultaron sobre las implicancias de una posible invitaci\u00f3n al imputado Mohsen Rezai para que visite dicho pa\u00eds, por lo que el abajo firmante dispuso comunicar inmediatamente a Interpol que, en caso de concretarse la visita, se haga efectiva la orden de captura internacional, con notificaci\u00f3n roja, que pesa sobre el nombrado (Oficio del Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto del 9/05/2014, Nota n\u00b05572/14; Oficio al Jefe del Departamento Interpol de la Polic\u00eda Federal Argentina fechado en 12/5/2014).\nLas evidencias obtenidas demuestran que Salehi hab\u00eda acordado con Timerman que el cese de las notificaciones rojas se producir\u00eda con la sola firma del memorando de entendimiento. Por ello, el art\u00edculo 7mo - referido a la comunicaci\u00f3n a Interpol- fue el \u00fanico previsto con car\u00e1cter operativo. El \u00fanico que pod\u00eda y deb\u00eda tener aplicaci\u00f3n inmediata. El resto de los puntos del acuerdo necesitan la ratificaci\u00f3n de ambas partes, el intercambio de notas reversales y la vigencia del tratado para que puedan ser cumplidos.\nLa comunicaci\u00f3n de la firma del acuerdo a un organismo exclusivamente policial, sin injerencia ni inter\u00e9s alguno en los tratados o avenimientos entre sus estados miembros, como es Interpol, tuvo como \u00fanico prop\u00f3sito el cese de las notificaciones rojas de los pr\u00f3fugos iran\u00edes.\nLo cierto fue que las intenciones criminales para viabilizar la impunidad de los cinco acusados con prioridad de b\u00fasqueda policial por la causa AMIA, chocaron con un obst\u00e1culo inesperado. Con fecha 15 de marzo de 2013, la Organizaci\u00f3n Internacional de Polic\u00eda Criminal -\nInterpol- envi\u00f3 una misiva al Canciller Timerman, firmada por Joel Sollier, Consejero Jur\u00eddico del organismo, en la que, en referencia al memorando de entendimiento, afirmaba:\tLa\tOficina de Asuntos Jur\u00eddicos de la\nSecretar\u00eda General de INTERPOL manifiesta que dicho acuerdo no implica ning\u00fan tipo de cambio en el estatus de las notificaciones rojas publicadas en relaci\u00f3n a los cr\u00edmenes investigados en la causa AMIA...\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd (Nota N\u00b0 LA/35678-47/3.1/EGI/tsa, Consejer\u00eda Jur\u00eddica, Secretar\u00eda General, Organizaci\u00f3n Internacional de Polic\u00eda Criminal, 15/03/2013).\nSeguidamente, en el mes de mayo de 2013, el canciller argentino se reuni\u00f3 con el Secretario General de Interpol, Sr. Ronald Noble en Lyon, Francia. El Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto emiti\u00f3 un comunicado donde afirm\u00f3: \u201c...Durante \u00a1a reuni\u00f3n, el Secretario General Noble reafirm\u00f3 los t\u00e9rminos vertidos por el Consejero General de Interpol en la carta del 15 de marzo, en el sentido que el Memor\u00e1ndum con Ir\u00e1n no afecta en forma alguna el estatus de \u00a1as notificaciones rojas emitidas por Interpol a instancias de la Argentina...\u201d (Comunicado de Prensa N\u00b0 122/13 del 30/05/2013). Por su parte, Interpol reiter\u00f3 esta misma informaci\u00f3n por comunicado oficial (Interpol, \u201cLa visita del canciller argentino a Interpol se centr\u00f3 en la colaboraci\u00f3n policial internacional\u201d, 30/05/2013).\nJustamente, la demora y reticencia del gobierno de Ir\u00e1n en la ratificaci\u00f3n del memorando respondi\u00f3 a que el Canciller Timerman se vio impedido de cumplir con el compromiso secreto asumido respecto de las notificaciones rojas de Interpol que deb\u00edan cesar y no cesaron.\nEsto explica un hecho palpable: el retraimiento de Ir\u00e1n. Desde el momento en que Interpol comunic\u00f3 que no caer\u00edan las notificaciones, Ir\u00e1n suspendi\u00f3 el tratamiento interno de ratificaci\u00f3n del acuerdo, retir\u00e1ndolo del parlamento donde estaba incluido en el orden de temas a ser tratados, difiriendo en forma indefinida su implementaci\u00f3n (Pagni, Carlos, \u201cEl kirchnerismo en el peor de los mundos\u201d, La Naci\u00f3n, 30/05/2013; \u201cTimerman estim\u00f3 que en el pr\u00f3ximo mes y medio el parlamento iran\u00ed aprobar\u00e1 el acuerdo por la AMIA\u201d, T\u00e9lam, 18/4/13; \u201cUltim\u00e1tum oficial a\n\n\nMinisterio P\u00fablico de la Naci\u00f3n\nIr\u00e1n: Espero que en un mes aprueben el memor\u00e1ndum\u201d, Infobae, 18/04/2013; \u201cReclaman a Ir\u00e1n el aval al acuerdo\u201d, Clar\u00edn, 19/04/2013).\nSin perjuicio de ello y hasta la actualidad, las autoridades argentinas involucradas en este tema han intentado subsanar este contratiempo y han buscado persuadir a Ir\u00e1n para que acelere sus procesos internos, a fin de contribuir al plan de encubrimiento en marcha.\nEn ese contexto, en abril de 2013, Timerman declar\u00f3: \u201cYo espero que en el pr\u00f3ximo mes, mes y medio ya est\u00e9 aprobado ...cuanto m\u00e1s tarden ellos, m\u00e1s dudas se van a crear sobre sus intenciones.

En esa oportunidad, el Canciller explic\u00f3 que el parlamento iran\u00ed deb\u00eda volver del receso legislativo y a partir de all\u00ed ten\u00eda como prioridad el tratamiento del presupuesto anual y \u201cluego est\u00e1 el tratado con la Argentina\u201d (\u201cTimerman conf\u00eda en que Ir\u00e1n firmar\u00e1 el pacto en un mes\u201d, La Gaceta, 19/04/2013). Ese mes, mes y medio, ya cumpli\u00f3 m\u00e1s de un a\u00f1o.\nCon el correr de los meses y, sobre todo, luego de la comunicaci\u00f3n de Interpol de que las notificaciones rojas seguir\u00edan vigentes, Teher\u00e1n advirti\u00f3 que al canciller argentino le hab\u00eda sido impedido, por razones ajenas a su voluntad, cumplir lo prometido. Y as\u00ed lo hizo saber, transmitiendo su malestar.\nJorge \u201cYussuf\u2019 Khalil, al d\u00eda siguiente de haber regresado de la Rep\u00fablica Isl\u00e1mica de Ir\u00e1n, y luego de haberse reunido \u201ccon las m\u00e1s altas esferas...con los responsables capos...con la canciller\u00eda...\u201d (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 11/05/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-05-11 - 173407-12, CD 0022), le transmiti\u00f3 claramente al interlocutor paralelo de\nlos funcionarios argentinos, Luis D\u2019El\u00eda, la desilusi\u00f3n iran\u00ed frente al compromiso incumplido. Manifest\u00f3:\nKhalil: Junt\u00e9monos, porque tenemos algunas tareas para hacer.\nD\u2019El\u00eda: Ah bueno, bueno, dale, dale, dale...che, \u00bfpor qu\u00e9 est\u00e1 demorado todo eso?\nKhalil: Yyyyy...hay un poquito de....esto entre nosotros, hay un poquito de desaz\u00f3n de all\u00e1, de all\u00e1, no s\u00e9 porque, hay desaz\u00f3n.\nD\u2019El\u00eda: \u00bf\u00a1Desaz\u00f3n!?\nKhalil: Desaz\u00f3n, s\u00ed, s\u00ed, s\u00ed.

Habiendo sido formulada esta declaraci\u00f3n en el mes de marzo de 2013, es decir, dos meses despu\u00e9s de la firma del Memorando de Entendimiento, resulta evidente que Salehi estaba hablando de otro acuerdo, de un convenio que en marzo de 2013 todav\u00eda no hab\u00eda sido dado a conocer al p\u00fablico en general y que inclu\u00eda el tema de las notificaciones rojas de los acusados iran\u00edes que, seg\u00fan hab\u00eda dicho anteriormente, debieron haber ca\u00eddo. En otras palabras, al verse truncada la posibilidad de avanzar con el compromiso asumido por parte de Timerman, Salehi reconoci\u00f3 la existencia de un acuerdo secreto sobre el tema. No trepid\u00f3 en poner en evidencia a Timerman al sentirse traicionado.\nCuatro d\u00edas despu\u00e9s de la conversaci\u00f3n en la que Khalil comunic\u00f3 a D'El\u00eda la \u201cdesaz\u00f3n\u201d de Teher\u00e1n porque Timerman se \u201cmand\u00f3 alguna\u201d, le pidieron a Khalil que se contacte urgente con D'El\u00eda que estaba \u201cen Presidencia\u201d. D'El\u00eda puso la comunicaci\u00f3n telef\u00f3nica en altavoz y aclar\u00f3 que hab\u00eda un funcionario escuchando: \u201c...yo estoy con una persona amiga, que te est\u00e1 escuchando, que yo no voy a nombrar...\u201d. En esa conversaci\u00f3n, Khalil destac\u00f3: \u201c...Si, eso es importante, que cuentes eso tambi\u00e9n. Esos dos mensajes que...que molestaron. Y que de alguna manera u otra est\u00e1n perjudicando la relaci\u00f3n...\u201d (Comunicaciones del 15/05/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-05-15-100907-10, CD 26; Archivo B-1009-2013-05-15-101055-4, CD 26).\nLuego, el 20 de mayo y a ra\u00edz de la reuni\u00f3n entre D'El\u00eda y el Ministro Julio De Vido, Khalil volvi\u00f3 sobre el tema cuando le reiter\u00f3 a D\u2019El\u00eda: \u201c...De Vido tiene que saber que Timerman no cumpli\u00f3 con algunas cosas, esto es as\u00ed de claro, no cumpli\u00f3 con algunas cosas...\u201d (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 20/5/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-\n2013-\t05-20-111124-8, CD 31). Y al d\u00eda siguiente, en relaci\u00f3n al mismo tema, D'El\u00eda repiti\u00f3 \u201c...qued\u00f3 en hablar con la n\u00famero uno y me llamaba...\u201d, en obvia alusi\u00f3n a la Dra.

El mensaje de \u201cdesaz\u00f3n\u201d por el incumplimiento respecto de las notificaciones rojas hab\u00eda llegado de Teher\u00e1n a la Casa Rosada.\nEsta cuesti\u00f3n sigui\u00f3 vigente muchos meses despu\u00e9s, cuando Khalil volvi\u00f3 a se\u00f1alar que no existi\u00f3 \u201cdejadez\u201d por parte de Ir\u00e1n en relaci\u00f3n a la ratificaci\u00f3n interna del pacto (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 24/02/2014, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2014-02-24-171304-2, CD 311).\nAhora bien, frente a la contundencia del compromiso trunco, la reacci\u00f3n de Ir\u00e1n fue enga\u00f1osa, dado que dijeron haber aprobado el acuerdo por una v\u00eda alternativa, sin comunicaci\u00f3n oficial alguna y sin generar efectos legales. Aunque astutamente los iran\u00edes actuaron como si se hubiera ratificado. En efecto, con fecha 20 de mayo de 2013 el entonces Encargado de Negocios de Ir\u00e1n en Argentina, Al\u00ed Pakdaman, inform\u00f3 en una entrevista radial que su pa\u00eds hab\u00eda ratificado el memorando de entendimiento. El acuerdo hab\u00eda sido aprobado por el entonces Presidente de Ir\u00e1n, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, el d\u00eda anterior, sin tratamiento parlamentario alguno (\u201cTeher\u00e1n aprob\u00f3 el memor\u00e1ndum por el atentado a la AMIA\u201d, P\u00e1gina 12, 20/05/2013; Kollmann, Ra\u00fal, \u201cAhmadinejad eligi\u00f3 la v\u00eda expeditiva\u201d, P\u00e1gina 12,21/05/2013).\nEn ese contexto, Khalil le dijo a D'El\u00eda: \u201c...Te dije, boludo, que se iba a aprobar, que te quedes tranquilo...\u201d y le reclam\u00f3: \u201c...que haga gestos este gobierno, Luis, nosotros ya nos cansamos de hacer gestos, que este gobierno empiece a hacer gestos...\u201d (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 20/5/13, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-05-20-122551 -14, CD 31). Los gestos a los que se refer\u00eda Khalil eran la baja de las notificaciones rojas, aspiraci\u00f3n principal de Ir\u00e1n, prometida por Timerman y nunca concretada debido a la acci\u00f3n de Interpol. En respuesta a ello, el \u201cvocero\u201d del gobierno argentino, Luis D'El\u00eda, respondi\u00f3: \u201c...pero hay un matiz ac\u00e1, que va a generar quilombo...lo aprob\u00f3 Ahmadinejad, no lo aprob\u00f3 el congreso iran\u00ed...\u201d (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 20/5/13, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B- 1009-2013-05-20-130940-28, CD 31)\nEn junio de ese mismo a\u00f1o trascendi\u00f3 que en los d\u00edas siguientes se dar\u00eda a conocer la notificaci\u00f3n de Ir\u00e1n sobre la aprobaci\u00f3n del acuerdo y se realizar\u00eda una presentaci\u00f3n conjunta de ambos pa\u00edses, para comunicar los pasos a seguir (Dinatale, Mart\u00edn, \u201cNeg\u00f3 Ir\u00e1n la denuncia del fiscal Nisman y lo acus\u00f3 de sionista\u201d; La Naci\u00f3n, 4/06/2013).\nA pesar de la reticencia de Ir\u00e1n, las autoridades argentinas segu\u00edan esforz\u00e1ndose para que se ratifique el acuerdo, dado el inter\u00e9s de varios de sus m\u00e1s altos funcionarios en continuar con el plan criminal. En esa l\u00ednea deben interpretarse las palabras de la Sra. Presidente en ocasi\u00f3n de su discurso en la apertura de la 68\u00b0 Asamblea General de Naciones Unidas, el 24 de septiembre de 2013, cuando afirm\u00f3 que ya hab\u00eda transcurrido un tiempo prudencial, que la Argentina ya hab\u00eda dado aprobaci\u00f3n al acuerdo y que ahora era el tumo de Ir\u00e1n.

La intenci\u00f3n era clara: con su visita, Timerman estaba intentando convencer a Ronald Noble que la controversia con Ir\u00e1n por el caso AMIA ya estaba encausada, a trav\u00e9s del Memorando de Entendimiento, para que cediera y dispusiera el cese de las notificaciones rojas.\nEn enero de 2014, a d\u00edas de cumplirse un a\u00f1o de la firma del acuerdo con Ir\u00e1n, el Palacio San Mart\u00edn emiti\u00f3 un comunicado relativo al\nRep\u00fablica Isl\u00e1mica de Ir\u00e1n y la Rep\u00fablica Argentina para allanar el camino de la justicia en la resoluci\u00f3n del atentado a la AMIA..\nEn ese encuentro, \u201c...la Rep\u00fablica Argentina le entreg\u00f3 a la delegaci\u00f3n iran\u00ed una propuesta que permitir\u00eda concluir el mandato del Memor\u00e1ndum en 12 meses luego de la conformaci\u00f3n de la Comisi\u00f3n de Expertos e incluye las garant\u00edas e inmunidades que permitan al Juez argentino de la Causa AMIA realizar las indagatorias en la ciudad de Teher\u00e1n.

Como una suerte de disculpa que deja entrever algo aqu\u00ed ya probado: la persistente vigencia de las notificaciones rojas es una contrariedad, dado que exist\u00eda un compromiso a dejarlas caer.\nParalelamente, tambi\u00e9n en noviembre de ese a\u00f1o, Timerman continu\u00f3 intentando subsanar la subsistencia inesperada de las notificaciones rojas. Volvi\u00f3 a reunirse con Noble, a quien inform\u00f3 de la continuaci\u00f3n de las tratativas de ambos pa\u00edses en tomo al memor\u00e1ndum (Interpol, Comunicado de Prensa: \u201cLa seguridad mundial, eje de la visita a INTERPOL del Ministro argentino de Asuntos Exteriores\u201d, Lyon, Francia, 26/11/2013).

Nuevamente, la vigencia de las notificaciones rojas, cuando se hab\u00eda pactado lo contrario, prim\u00f3 a la hora de decidir. En concreto, hasta la fecha, no se ha producido el intercambio de las notas reversales y, en consecuencia, el tratado no ha entrado en vigencia (Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto, Comunicado de Prensa N\u00b0110/13, del 21/05/2013).\nLuce evidente que el compromiso de Timerman, por orden de la Sra. Presidente, fue gestionar el cese de las notificaciones rojas en Interpol, dado que se trataba del inter\u00e9s cardinal de Ir\u00e1n para firmar el acuerdo. El apego a la legalidad del organismo internacional de polic\u00eda frustr\u00f3 este primer objetivo del cometido criminal de los autores de este terrible plan de impunidad. Al cabo de un tiempo, consciente de la imposibilidad de barrer con las notificaciones rojas, Timerman hizo saber a su contraparte que el fracaso de ese punto no hab\u00eda sido su responsabilidad y que pese a todos sus esfuerzos en ese sentido, las notificaciones rojas no cayeron. Ello no signific\u00f3 la desarticulaci\u00f3n del plan de impunidad.\nFuera de toda duda, el inter\u00e9s de Teher\u00e1n gir\u00f3 en torno al cese de las notificaciones rojas de Interpol. No obstante ello, cabe tener en claro tres cuestiones. Primero, este rev\u00e9s no implica que el inter\u00e9s de Ir\u00e1n en el acuerdo haya desaparecido por completo. Segundo, para la configuraci\u00f3n del encubrimiento aqu\u00ed denunciado resulta irrelevante el inter\u00e9s de Ir\u00e1n o su predisposici\u00f3n respecto de la maniobra desplegada por los autores argentinos y sus c\u00f3mplices. Esto es as\u00ed, porque la configuraci\u00f3n de este tipo penal no exige el consentimiento, ni siquiera demanda el conocimiento por parte del sujeto encubierto. Tercero, este rev\u00e9s no conlleva la desarticulaci\u00f3n de la operaci\u00f3n de encubrimiento llevada adelante por altos funcionarios del gobierno argentino y dem\u00e1s part\u00edcipes, activada por el acuerdo y que ser\u00e1 explicada en detalle en el ac\u00e1pite siguiente.\nEn suma, la existencia de este compromiso secreto y su frustrado cumplimiento permite comprender el retraimiento de Ir\u00e1n en relaci\u00f3n a este primer objetivo del plan aqu\u00ed denunciado y la desconfianza que debi\u00f3 generar entre encubridores y encubiertos.\nc. l.b) Punto Quinto del Memorando de Entendimiento\nEn torno al tema de las notificaciones rojas de Interpol resta analizar un \u00faltimo punto. Como ya se dijo, el memorando de entendimiento cuenta con variados mecanismos o recursos, incorporados a su letra, para llevar adelante los distintos pasos convenidos en el marco del plan de encubrimiento. Esto, como se adelant\u00f3, dota al plan de flexibilidad y adaptabilidad a distintos escenarios, dada la enorme cantidad de variables imposibles de controlar por autores y part\u00edcipes. Gracias a esta caracter\u00edstica del texto, la cuesti\u00f3n del cese de las notificaciones rojas de Interpol, de m\u00e1ximo inter\u00e9s para la parte iran\u00ed, a\u00fan puede ser implementada siguiendo la letra del memorando, aunque no de manera tan directa y simple como lo prev\u00e9 el art\u00edculo s\u00e9ptimo.\nEn ese sentido, a\u00fan cabe la posibilidad de conseguir dicho objetivo, pero -esta vez- a trav\u00e9s del punto 5 del acuerdo, esto es, en el marco de las audiencias a ser llevadas a cabo en Teher\u00e1n, en las cuales la \u201cComisi\u00f3n de la Verdad\u201d creada por este tratado, entrevistar\u00e1 a los cinco imputados iran\u00edes que tienen notificaciones rojas de Interpol, en presencia\n\n\nMinisterio P\u00fablico de la Naci\u00f3n\nde autoridades judiciales iran\u00edes y argentinas y de los representantes de ambos estados.\nN\u00f3tese que de los ocho imputados iran\u00edes cuya declaraci\u00f3n indagatoria ha sido ordenada en la causa, en el punto 5 del acuerdo que regla las \u201cAudiencias de Teher\u00e1n\u201d \u00fanicamente se incluy\u00f3 a los imputados con notificaci\u00f3n roja de Interpol, cuyo cese -conforme lo determinado por la prueba- era esencial para Ir\u00e1n y as\u00ed se hab\u00eda acordado. No existe explicaci\u00f3n plausible para entender por qu\u00e9 las autoridades argentinas aceptaron que s\u00f3lo se prevean audiencias respecto de aquellos cuyas notificaciones rojas pod\u00edan caer, dejando de lado a los restantes imputados iran\u00edes con captura judicial vigente, ordenada por el Sr. Juez Federal, Dr. Rodolfo Canicoba Corral.\nAs\u00ed, del modo\ten\tque ha sido redactado el\tpunto 5 del\nmemorando surge que los imputados sin notificaciones rojas de Interpol (Rafsanjani, Velayati y Soleimanpour) no tienen incentivo alguno para presentarse ante la justicia. El acuerdo preserva la impunidad de facto de la que gozan actualmente y la actuaci\u00f3n de la comisi\u00f3n podr\u00eda garantiz\u00e1rsela para siempre.\nPor otro lado, los imputados con notificaci\u00f3n roja (Fallahijan, Vahidi, Rezai, Rabbani y Asghari) podr\u00edan presentarse ante un juez iran\u00ed, miembros de la Comisi\u00f3n\ty\tel juez argentino, sin por\tello estar\nsometi\u00e9ndose al proceso penal nacional.\nSi hubiera habido\tuna voluntad de someter\ta\ttodos los\nacusados iran\u00edes a la acci\u00f3n\tde\tla justicia argentina, como\tse\targument\u00f3\npara justificar el pacto ante la opini\u00f3n p\u00fablica, se hubiera incluido a todos los acusados y se hubieran acordado verdaderas declaraciones indagatorias conforme la ley argentina para todos los imputados y no meras entrevistas, solo para aquellos con notificaci\u00f3n roja de Interpol.\nPresente ello, corresponde resaltar la verdadera entidad de estas \u201caudiencias\u201d y su posible implicancia. En primer lugar, cabe tener presente que en el debate parlamentario de aprobaci\u00f3n del acuerdo, el Canciller Timerman asever\u00f3 que la presentaci\u00f3n de los imputados ante este conjunto\nheterog\u00e9neo de actores pol\u00edticos y judiciales se equipara al acto de encontrarse a derecho ante autoridades judiciales en el marco de un proceso penal en tr\u00e1mite. En sus palabras: \u201cEl memor\u00e1ndum establece que las autoridades judiciales argentinas proceder\u00e1n a interrogar a aquellas personas respecto de las cuales Interpol ha emitido una notificaci\u00f3n roja de captura. Esta previsi\u00f3n sigue estrictamente la normativa procesal penal nacional que regula la procedencia de la declaraci\u00f3n indagatoria de los imputados...\u201d (Versi\u00f3n taquigr\u00e1fica del Plenario de Comisiones en el Senado de la Naci\u00f3n, 13 de febrero de 2013). Esto mismo ya hab\u00eda dicho a los medios d\u00edas atr\u00e1s, cuando declar\u00f3 que: \u201cLo concreto es que los sospechosos iran\u00edes se van a sentar en el banquillo y se someter\u00e1n a la indagatoria en los t\u00e9rminos de la ley argentina, ante un juez argentino y un fiscal argentino\u201d (Kollmann, Ra\u00fal, \u201cLos iran\u00edes se someter\u00e1n a la ley argentina\u201d, P\u00e1gina 12, 30/01/2013).\nCabe aclarar, aunque resulte redundante, que del acuerdo no surge en modo alguno que el interrogatorio est\u00e9 a cargo de las autoridades judiciales argentinas como as\u00ed tampoco incluye referencias expresas a la aplicaci\u00f3n de la normativa procesal argentina en ese acto y, menos a\u00fan, habilita al juez a detener a los imputados a su disposici\u00f3n, si lo creyera necesario, conforme lo prev\u00e9 el derecho argentino. Primero, la acusaci\u00f3n debe estar respaldada por un juez iran\u00ed de acuerdo a lo reglado por la ley iran\u00ed, lo que colisiona con lo expresado p\u00fablicamente por el r\u00e9gimen de Teher\u00e1n, en tanto afirm\u00f3 haberse asegurado de la inocencia de todos sus ciudadanos.\nAdem\u00e1s, no son todos \u201clos sospechosos iran\u00edes\u201d los que se sentar\u00edan en el banquillo, como se\u00f1ala el Canciller, sino que est\u00e1 previsto en el acuerdo, como ya se indic\u00f3, que se interrogue solamente a cinco de los ocho imputados iran\u00edes. Sobra decir que se est\u00e1 haciendo referencia a una actividad netamente judicial que el acuerdo delega ilegalmente en la \u201cComisi\u00f3n de la Verdad\u201d, cuyas conclusiones -como la prueba lo refiere- ya estaban acordadas de antemano.\nAl 8ERT0 NI\nFISCAL GENERAL\nPero, volviendo al an\u00e1lisis, una vez que los mencionados imputados comparezcan ante el juez iran\u00ed, los miembros de la \u201cComisi\u00f3n de la Verdad\u201d y el juez argentino, se podr\u00eda argumentar que ya no existir\u00edan motivos legales -en principio- para que Argentina siga requiriendo a Interpol la m\u00e1xima prioridad de b\u00fasqueda de estos imputados que, desde esta l\u00f3gica, ya estar\u00edan presentados en el proceso seguido en su contra. Esto har\u00eda, sin m\u00e1s, caer las notificaciones rojas, aunque el juez nunca tuvo posibilidades concretas de interrogarlos ni detenerlos, si as\u00ed lo considerase. Otro ardid para lograr la impunidad de los acusados.\nEn efecto, como en el acuerdo no se ha garantizado de forma alguna que el juez pueda proceder a la detenci\u00f3n de los imputados, si \u00e9ste decidiera dictar su procesamiento y prisi\u00f3n preventiva despu\u00e9s de la supuesta \u201cindagatoria\u201d, se activa la trampa: ya presentados ante la \u201cComisi\u00f3n de la Verdad\u201d, caen las notificaciones rojas de Interpol, pero no hay forma de sujetar a proceso a los imputados, que ahora quedan m\u00e1s libres que antes, sin ninguna restricci\u00f3n a su movilidad, con una justicia atada de pies y manos.\nAhora bien, cabe destacar que las audiencias de Teher\u00e1n previstas en el propio memorando distan enormemente de lo que se considera una declaraci\u00f3n indagatoria conforme la normativa procesal vigente (art. 294 y cctes. del C.P.P.) y solo pueden ser entendidas -de acuerdo con la letra del tratado- como una simple entrevista ante los comisionados, en presencia de autoridades judiciales y representantes de ambos pa\u00edses.\nComo ya se expuso, en el escenario que describe el tratado, la magistratura argentina tiene totalmente restringidas sus facultades legalmente previstas. El acuerdo no prev\u00e9 que el juez argentino pueda hacer comparecer por la fuerza p\u00fablica a los imputados, ni que lleve adelante el referido interrogatorio, al resguardar los derechos garantizados por la ley iran\u00ed, que -adem\u00e1s- impide que se pueda forzar la comparecencia, fundamentalmente, ante un magistrado for\u00e1neo (punto 8). Asimismo, conforme el tratado, el juez no puede disponer su detenci\u00f3n -de\nconsiderarlo adecuado- y/o su traslado a nuestro pa\u00eds. El documento tampoco garantiza la aplicaci\u00f3n de la ley argentina en la materializaci\u00f3n de este acto sino que, por el contrario, todo indica que la ley aplicable -por razones de territorialidad- ser\u00eda la iran\u00ed.\nEn consecuencia, es completamente falaz afirmar que los imputados se encontrar\u00edan a derecho con solo presentarse a la entrevista ante la comisi\u00f3n, conforme lo estipula el punto 5. Sin embargo, la amplitud y vaguedad del instrumento y las m\u00faltiples interpretaciones posibles, abrir\u00edan necesariamente un debate, con el s\u00f3lido riesgo de que esta discusi\u00f3n se desarrolle con las notificaciones rojas ya extintas, es decir, con el encubrimiento m\u00e1s avanzado a\u00fan. Como puede advertirse, todo est\u00e1 estructurado para la impunidad, con varias alternativas posibles para lograr tal fin.\nc.2) Impunidad por imposibilidad de aplicaci\u00f3n de las disposiciones del tratado\nComo se dijo previamente, entre los mecanismos previstos en el pacto para garantizar la impunidad de los pr\u00f3fugos iran\u00edes, existe una v\u00eda que descansa en la imposibilidad de aplicar sus disposiciones, por trabas a partir de un procedimiento intrincado, que no conduce a nada y que solo diluye acusaciones y viabiliza la desincriminaci\u00f3n, lo que est\u00e1 favorecido por una interminable sucesi\u00f3n de pasos a definir y la ausencia total de plazos que marquen su implementaci\u00f3n.\nEn concreto, el memorando no tiene previsto ning\u00fan plazo. No se pautaron tiempos para crear la comisi\u00f3n, ni para emitir sus reglas de procedimiento, ni para la remisi\u00f3n de las pruebas e informaciones, ni para la elaboraci\u00f3n del informe, ni para la realizaci\u00f3n de las audiencias en Teher\u00e1n. Para nada. Nada tiene plazo en este acuerdo. \u00bfY por qu\u00e9? Porque lo \u00fanico que importa del mismo es que permita favorecer y encubrir a los imputados, garantiz\u00e1ndoles impunidad. Por eso el acuerdo no garantiza ley ni proceso y solo garantiza impunidad.\nDe hecho, en la propuesta de noviembre de 2013, el Canciller Timerman dijo estar buscando fijar el plazo de un a\u00f1o para \u201c...concluir el mandato del memor\u00e1ndum...\u201d. No obstante, en los hechos, estipul\u00f3 que dicho plazo comenzar\u00eda a correr reci\u00e9n a partir de la creaci\u00f3n de la comisi\u00f3n, lo que supeditaba un plazo cierto a una condici\u00f3n o circunstancia incierta y sin t\u00e9rmino temporal que la rija. Lo mismo que nada. Fue un nuevo intento por ocultar los mecanismos de impunidad del plan. Y, adem\u00e1s, sobra decir que a la fecha, Ir\u00e1n no ha respondido a la supuesta propuesta (Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto, Informaci\u00f3n de Prensa N\u00b0279/13, \u201cDeclaraci\u00f3n de prensa le\u00edda por el canciller Timerman en Casa Rosada el domingo 24 de noviembre a las 21 horas\u201d, 24/11/2013).\nEn suma, esta omisi\u00f3n en materia de plazos y lo intrincado del procedimiento previsto, tambi\u00e9n constituyen salvoconductos de impunidad, dado que permiten alegar que hubo un acuerdo de partes y as\u00ed viabilizar pol\u00edticamente el restablecimiento de relaciones plenas entre ambos estados, sin solucionar realmente el tema AMIA.\nc.3) La \u201cComisi\u00f3n de la Verdad\u201d y la invenci\u00f3n de una hip\u00f3tesis alternativa para desvincular a los iran\u00edes de la causa AMIA.\nEl plan criminal desplegado tiene por fin encubrir a los imputados iran\u00edes en la causa AMIA, contribuyendo a sustraerlos de la acci\u00f3n de la justicia argentina, desvincularlos de la imputaci\u00f3n judicial que pesa sobre ellos y -de ese modo- garantizarles su impunidad y cerrar definitivamente toda investigaci\u00f3n respecto de ellos.\nEsta maniobra delictiva estuvo motivada por el inter\u00e9s de ciertos funcionarios argentinos de acercarse geopol\u00edticamente a Ir\u00e1n y restablecer las relaciones comerciales de Estado a Estado. Para ello se acord\u00f3, a trav\u00e9s de conductas evidentemente delictivas, remover el impedimento que ha obstruido la relaci\u00f3n bilateral por a\u00f1os, esto es, la cuesti\u00f3n judicial pendiente por la causa AMIA.\nEn este punto habr\u00e1n de exponerse los elementos probatorios que demuestran que la \u201cComisi\u00f3n de la Verdad\u201d prevista en el memorando de entendimiento firmado con Ir\u00e1n, constituye una de las principales v\u00edas aptas para posibilitar la desincriminaci\u00f3n de los imputados iran\u00edes respecto del atentado contra la AMIA, sin perjuicio de su real responsabilidad en el hecho, permitiendo agotar la maniobra de encubrimiento aqu\u00ed denunciada.\nAsimismo, se enumerar\u00e1n las pruebas que demuestran que autores y c\u00f3mplices, como parte integrante del plan, hab\u00edan planificado y avanzado en la fabricaci\u00f3n de una hip\u00f3tesis acusatoria alternativa, falsa pero veros\u00edmil, con \u201cnuevas\u201d pruebas fraudulentas, para redireccionar ilegalmente la pesquisa hacia otros imputados y as\u00ed desligar definitivamente a los nacionales iran\u00edes de toda relaci\u00f3n con el atentado, enga\u00f1ando de esta manera a familiares, a v\u00edctimas, a la justicia y a la sociedad toda.\nc.3.a) La \u201cComisi\u00f3n de la verdad \u201d y su verdadero rol en el plan.\nEl esquema gestado en el acuerdo permite contar con herramientas para avanzar hacia este objetivo que, como se advierte, es mucho m\u00e1s amplio e importante que el simple cese de la vigencia de las notificaciones rojas de Interpol.\nAs\u00ed, el Memorando de Entendimiento y fundamentalmente los puntos que prev\u00e9n la creaci\u00f3n, conformaci\u00f3n, facultades y obligaciones de la \u201cComisi\u00f3n de la Verdad\u201d (1 a 5 y 8) est\u00e1n redactados de modo tal de posibilitar: 1) la deslegitimaci\u00f3n de la investigaci\u00f3n sustanciada ante la justicia nacional, 2) la desautorizaci\u00f3n de los funcionarios que intervinieron en ella, 3) la tergiversaci\u00f3n de pruebas y conclusiones, 4) la desacreditaci\u00f3n de la acusaci\u00f3n contra los actuales imputados y 5) el redireccionamiento de la investigaci\u00f3n hacia nuevos culpables, como siempre solicit\u00f3 Ir\u00e1n y ahora, delictivamente fue concedido por ciertas autoridades argentinas, en un giro de ciento ochenta grados con lo sostenido por el gobierno de N\u00e9stor Carlos Kirchner y parte del de Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez.\nEstas acciones, sin importar si son realizadas en forma individual o conjunta, tienen por objeto generar un salvoconducto destinado a encubrir en forma definitiva a los imputados, permitiendo que \u00e9stos eludan la acci\u00f3n de la justicia, con el objeto de garantizarles su impunidad y que no se los vuelva a investigar nunca m\u00e1s.\nComo ya se dijo, el pacto guarda en la amplitud de su redacci\u00f3n cierto grado de sutileza, para que los objetivos delictivos subyacentes no emerjan en forma grotesca a los ojos del mundo. Con ese norte, se decidi\u00f3 que las conclusiones de la comisi\u00f3n no fueran propiamente vinculantes, dado que ello hubiera sido demasiado visible. Pero en los hechos es como si lo fueran, ya que los gobiernos se comprometieron a atar \u201csus futuras acciones\u201d a los descubrimientos y recomendaciones de la comisi\u00f3n creada, que como su nombre lo sugiere, desentra\u00f1ar\u00e1 \u201cla verdad\u201d. Esto obliga al Estado Argentino y a sus distintos \u00f3rganos, a atender al referido dictamen.\nLa comisi\u00f3n podr\u00eda, seg\u00fan lo habilita el acuerdo, desacreditar fraudulentamente la prueba obtenida en la causa judicial y/o incorporar informaciones o pruebas que resulten falsas o ileg\u00edtimas y, as\u00ed, redireccionar la investigaci\u00f3n o crear sospechas y suspicacias que permitan introducir \u201cnuevas hip\u00f3tesis\u201d sobre la explosi\u00f3n de la AMIA, que tengan por protagonistas a \u201cnuevos imputados\u201d que, a la luz del dictamen de comisi\u00f3n, terminen siendo los \u201cverdaderos autores\u201d del atentado.\nEn este rol legitimador-deslegitimador, la comisi\u00f3n tiene la capacidad de descartar lo actuado por la justicia, desarticulando las imputaciones, sin que exista mecanismo de revisi\u00f3n sobre su pronunciamiento que, una vez comunicado y aunque pudiera ser posteriormente rebatido en otros \u00e1mbitos, ya habr\u00eda generado un efecto deslegitimador irreversible. N\u00f3tese que su mera creaci\u00f3n ya constituye una flagrante descalificaci\u00f3n a la justicia argentina que, a la luz del acuerdo, parece necesitar de avales for\u00e1neos para avanzar con sus requerimientos y procedimientos.\nEn suma, el texto del acuerdo contiene un instrumento con la capacidad institucional de consumar el encubrimiento aqu\u00ed denunciado: la \u201cComisi\u00f3n de la Verdad\u201d.\nAnalizada en su totalidad la letra, el esp\u00edritu y los alcances del Memorando de Entendimiento surgen los siguientes interrogantes: \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 no se previo que el juez argentino pudiera tomar declaraciones indagatorias conforme a derecho, tal como lo prev\u00e9 la ley argentina? \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 si se dijo que se hab\u00eda logrado que los iran\u00edes acepten la jurisdicci\u00f3n argentina y declaren ante nuestro juez, no se lo puso por escrito en el acuerdo? \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 no se resguardaron sus facultades judiciales para poder disponer la comparecencia por la fuerza p\u00fablica de imputados renuentes y/o su posterior detenci\u00f3n si fuera necesaria? \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 se acord\u00f3 que las audiencias se llevaran a cabo en Teher\u00e1n, donde impera la ley iran\u00ed y donde el fiscal de la causa tiene pedido de captura -justamente- por haber acusado a funcionarios iran\u00edes? \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 se dice que el acuerdo es compatible con la ley argentina cuando su aplicaci\u00f3n implica dejar de lado la normativa en vigencia, \u00fanica garant\u00eda que resguarda al proceso penal de nulidades futuras? \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 no se paut\u00f3 ning\u00fan plazo, pero se habilit\u00f3 la comunicaci\u00f3n a Interpol a\u00fan sin que el tratado estuviera ratificado y vigente? \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 si Ir\u00e1n sostiene que cuenta con pruebas sobre el caso, no se exigi\u00f3 en el acuerdo que las presente ante la justicia argentina? \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 se cre\u00f3 una comisi\u00f3n con la facultad de deslegitimar lo actuado por la justicia argentina y se la llam\u00f3 \u201cde la verdad\u201d? \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 se acept\u00f3 que la justicia argentina sea examinada y juzgada por un \u00f3rgano extrajudicial con facultades judiciales ilegales? \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 el Poder Ejecutivo avanz\u00f3 sobre la investigaci\u00f3n de una causa penal en tr\u00e1mite, y no dud\u00f3 en conculcar el principio republicano de gobierno y la expresa prohibici\u00f3n del art. 109 de la Constituci\u00f3n Nacional? \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 se sigui\u00f3 mintiendo y diciendo que la negociaci\u00f3n comenz\u00f3 en septiembre de 2012, aun cuando las autoridades iran\u00edes no tuvieron restricciones legales ni secretos de estado que les impidieran reconocer que las mismas se hab\u00edan iniciado mucho tiempo antes? \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 se incumpli\u00f3 con la promesa de comunicar a las v\u00edctimas y\n\n\nMinisterio P\u00fablico de la Naci\u00f3n\na los familiares sobre los avances de la negociaci\u00f3n, previo a arribar a cualquier acuerdo? \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 se desoy\u00f3 el contundente rechazo que el memorando gener\u00f3 en las instituciones damnificadas por el atentado y - fundamentalmente- en varios grupos de familiares y v\u00edctimas que hicieron o\u00edr su disconformidad? Y as\u00ed se podr\u00eda seguir con much\u00edsimos interrogantes m\u00e1s.\nTodos estos porqu\u00e9s tienen una \u00fanica respuesta, sencilla e institucionalmente terrible: detr\u00e1s de este pacto se oculta un plan criminal dirigido a procurar la impunidad para todos los imputados iran\u00edes, creando instancias que puedan deslegitimar completamente las acusaciones de la justicia argentina respecto de todos ellos. Con su sola letra, el memorando tiene la potencialidad de deslegitimar las conclusiones a las que la justicia argentina arrib\u00f3 siguiendo las pruebas obtenidas y conforme a derecho. En su texto se acord\u00f3 llamar \u201cverdad\u201d aquello que emane de un \u00f3rgano creado por poderes pol\u00edticos e ilegalmente ungido de facultades judiciales.\nEllo, ya de por s\u00ed sumamente grave, adquiere ribetes escandalosos cuando se conocen los pormenores de la negociaci\u00f3n, que los part\u00edcipes expusieron sin tapujos en sus conversaciones, que en el punto siguiente se detallar\u00e1n.\nc.3.b) Nueva hip\u00f3tesis. nuevos imputados y nueva prueba: el camino a la impunidad.\nEl plan criminal ordenado por Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez, e instrumentado principalmente por H\u00e9ctor Timerman, para liberar a los imputados iran\u00edes de la acusaci\u00f3n emitida y avalada por la justicia argentina, ten\u00eda previsto no solo la desvinculaci\u00f3n de la causa de los actuales pr\u00f3fugos, sino tambi\u00e9n que otros responsables inventados ocuparan su lugar, para cerrar el c\u00edrculo de la impunidad a cualquier costo.\nAs\u00ed, la creaci\u00f3n de una nueva hip\u00f3tesis delictiva que explique desde otra perspectiva el atentado y que, redireccione la investigaci\u00f3n hacia\n\u201cnuevos responsables\u201d, result\u00f3 ser una pieza fundamental y de enorme utilidad en el encubrimiento.\nN\u00f3tese que el redireccionamiento de la pesquisa hacia nuevos responsables ha sido desde siempre la salida que ha sugerido y solicitado la Rep\u00fablica Isl\u00e1mica de Ir\u00e1n. Que se desista de acusar a sus ciudadanos y se dirija la investigaci\u00f3n para encontrar, en sus t\u00e9rminos, a los \u201cverdaderos autores\u201d.\nAhora, los funcionarios y c\u00f3mplices argentinos involucrados en la maniobra de encubrimiento se mostraron dispuestos a aceptar ese abordaje pero, entre ellos, reconoc\u00edan la verdad: que no se trataba de encontrar a los \u201cverdaderos\u201d autores, sino de inventar una nueva hip\u00f3tesis, conseguir pruebas que la tornen cre\u00edble, y acusar a terceros inocentes, aun cuando la responsabilidad, como se\u00f1alan las pruebas judiciales, sea de quienes se encuentran actualmente imputados. As\u00ed como se ha le\u00eddo. Los acusados aceptaron y realizaron su aporte para lograr este escandaloso fin, buscando vaciar de contenidos las imputaciones judiciales del mayor atentado terrorista perpetrado en nuestro pa\u00eds, imputando a personas que de antemano se sab\u00eda inocentes.\nPresente ello, en el mes de noviembre de 2012, es decir, antes que se firmara el memorando, los involucrados en el encubrimiento ya estaban trabajando en la fabricaci\u00f3n de los \u201cnuevos imputados\u201d por el atentado, por supuesto, ajenos a Ir\u00e1n. En ese tren de acciones, Jorge \u201cYussuf\u2019 Khalil ya se hab\u00eda reunido con el Dr. H\u00e9ctor Luis Yrimia, ex fiscal que intervino en la causa y ex juez de Instrucci\u00f3n, actualmente vinculado a un sector de la Secretar\u00eda de Inteligencia y part\u00edcipe de la maniobra que se denuncia. As\u00ed lo relat\u00f3: \u201c...tengo un par de cosas que contarte...tuve una charla con el fiscal...El fiscal de la causa...el que estaba, no el que est\u00e1 ahora... El que sabe es \u00e9ste que te digo... el fiscal de la causa....\u201d. Para luego se\u00f1alar que el contacto con Yrimia le habr\u00eda llegado a trav\u00e9s de Fernando Esteche: \u201c...Y, el que me sienta es Fernando\u201d (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 4/11/12, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2012- 11-04-130024-6, CD 182).\nSobre el armado de esta nueva hip\u00f3tesis, falsa pero necesaria para desplazar la acusaci\u00f3n de los imputados iran\u00edes, Fernando Esteche concluy\u00f3: \u201c...quieren construir un nuevo enemigo de la AMIA, el nuevo responsable de la AMIA, por ejemplo, es una necesidad que tienen que construirla, van a querer ir construyendo el consenso de esto...'''\u2019 y, de la conversaci\u00f3n se desprende, que esa tarea ha quedado a cargo de la Secretar\u00eda de Inteligencia, o al menos a un sector de ella. Al construir este \u201cnuevo enemigo\u201d, como \u201cno van a poder decir que fueron los israel\u00edes\u201d, porque -claramente- no ser\u00eda cre\u00edble, entonces ten\u00edan que armar una hip\u00f3tesis falsa, y hasta hablaron de involucrar a \u201cuna conexi\u00f3n de fachos locales\u201d (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 18/12/2012, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2012-12-18-183332-8, CD 226).\nEn un tiempo en que ni la justicia ni los familiares y v\u00edctimas del atentado sab\u00edan qu\u00e9 estaba ocurriendo con las negociaciones entre Argentina e Ir\u00e1n, estos \u201coperadores\u201d conoc\u00edan perfectamente que se ven\u00eda un cambio de hip\u00f3tesis y el redireccionamiento de la investigaci\u00f3n hacia \u201cnuevos imputados\u201d, que reemplazar\u00edan a los imputados iran\u00edes, fundado en pruebas falsas. Esto era as\u00ed, pues ellos eran justamente algunos de los encargados de armar la nueva hip\u00f3tesis falsa para desviar a la investigaci\u00f3n de su curso verdadero.\nEl objetivo de generar esta hip\u00f3tesis fraguada y redireccionar la pesquisa ha sido: \u201c...la esencia del nudo, el n\u00facleo del nudo...es la inocencia de Ir\u00e1n...\u201d, y tambi\u00e9n se dijo: \u201c...es la inocencia de Ir\u00e1n con la inocencia de la comunidad como conexi\u00f3n local...\u201d (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 14/02/2013, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2013-02-14-164341- 10, CD 284). Por eso, planificaban: \u201c...construir un nuevo enemigo de la AMIA, el nuevo responsable de la AMIA...\u201d, y reconoc\u00edan que los encubridores \u201c...Van a plantear un blanqueo con ustedes...\u201d, en alusi\u00f3n a los iran\u00edes (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 18/12/2012, abonado 1 1-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2012-12-18-183332-8, CD 226). En igual sentido, se dec\u00eda: \u201c...creo que vamos a la limpieza nuestra...\u201d (Conversaci\u00f3n del 1/6/2013, abonado 11-3964-0799, Archivo 224753, CD 0086).\nSab\u00edan tambi\u00e9n que la \u201cComisi\u00f3n de la Verdad\u201d no hab\u00eda sido creada para investigar absolutamente nada, sino para legitimar la mentira que se estaba fabricando. De hecho, en conversaciones del mismo d\u00eda en que se firm\u00f3 el pacto con Ir\u00e1n, se concluy\u00f3 que unas de las dos partes - Argentina o Ir\u00e1n- ten\u00eda que salir perjudicada por la actuaci\u00f3n de la \u201cComisi\u00f3n de la Verdad\u201d prevista en el acuerdo. Textualmente: \u201c...alguien va a salir con la...con la cara manchada de ac\u00e1...\u201d, a lo que Khalil, la voz de Ir\u00e1n en este tema, reconoci\u00f3: \u201c...Obvio, eso ya est\u00e1 arreglado...\u201d, pero aclar\u00f3 que no iban a ser de los iran\u00edes y remat\u00f3: \u201c... \u00a1\u00bfc\u00f3mo va a ser para el lado nuestro, boludo?! Si nosotros estamos sentados en la mesa...\u201d.

Resulta sumamente llamativo este tipo de intercambio entre un funcionario argentino y el referente de Ir\u00e1n, Jorge Khalil. Obviamente las cuestiones en torno al memorando y, fundamentalmente, al encubrimiento, hab\u00edan sido acordadas de antemano y de all\u00ed las expresiones esclarecedoras como \u201cyo te dije, vos no me ten\u00edas fe\u201d y \u201cya ganamos\u201d que dan cuenta que cierto sector de la inteligencia argentina, por decisi\u00f3n presidencial, estaba operando juntamente y en la l\u00ednea de los intereses de Teher\u00e1n.\nAsimismo, conversaron respecto a los miedos que hab\u00eda expresado Khalil respecto al desempe\u00f1o de Timerman en las negociaciones \u201c...o ver si no la sabe dibujar ...aparte, no la entiende...\u201d. Pero estos temores no importaban porque fue: \u201c...orden, orden, y orden y orden en alusi\u00f3n a que el canciller se limit\u00f3 a cumplir las \u00f3rdenes recibidas de la Dra.

Esta conversaci\u00f3n tambi\u00e9n sirve para demostrar que los part\u00edcipes sab\u00edan perfectamente que era \u201cun dibujo\u201d, es decir, que hab\u00eda que dise\u00f1ar h\u00e1bilmente un acuerdo cuya letra no expusiera burdamente el sofisticado plan subyacente.\nEn otra ocasi\u00f3n, \u201cAlian\u201d calcul\u00f3 \u201c...Que en un a\u00f1o y medio tengamos las buenas noticias...\u201d, en solapada alusi\u00f3n a la absoluci\u00f3n total de los iran\u00edes en la causa. Y aclar\u00f3: \u201c...estamos perfecto, a nivel internacional perfecto... \u201d y concluy\u00f3: \u201c...tranquilo, est\u00e1 CERRADO MUY ARRIBA...'\" (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 6/2/2013, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2013-02-06-203822-26, CD 276). Cabe aclarar que ese \u201cestamos\u201d inclu\u00eda a Khalil, es decir, a los intereses de Ir\u00e1n.\nSin importar las evidencias, los hechos o su verdadera responsabilidad en el atentado, los ciudadanos iran\u00edes iban a ser desvinculados de la causa, se le iba a \u201clavar la cara \u201d a Ir\u00e1n y eso estaba \u201ccerrado muy arriba\u201d, es decir, el plan ten\u00eda sello presidencial.\nEsto es de una gravedad institucional inusitada. La orden para ejecutar el delito provino directa y personalmente de la Presidente de la Naci\u00f3n y su instrumentaci\u00f3n qued\u00f3 a cargo de su Canciller, otros funcionarios de menor rango y terceros, que la investigaci\u00f3n que V.S. lleve adelante determinar\u00e1 en su justo alcance y medida.\nNo est\u00e1 de m\u00e1s reiterar que el Memorando de Entendimiento firmado entre la Rep\u00fablica Isl\u00e1mica de Ir\u00e1n y la Rep\u00fablica Argentina ha sido, ni m\u00e1s ni menos, que el medio seleccionado para presentar al mundo un camuflaje jur\u00eddico que disimule un sofisticado plan de impunidad para terroristas internacionales pr\u00f3fugos de la justicia argentina.\nSon concluyentes las pruebas que determinan que la autora intelectual del plan de encubrimiento para dotar de impunidad a los iran\u00edes se\u00f1alados por la justicia nacional como responsables del atentado a la\nAMIA fue la mism\u00edsima Presidente de la Naci\u00f3n Argentina, Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez.\nAhora bien, los autores y part\u00edcipes de este encubrimiento hab\u00edan llegado a la conclusi\u00f3n de que en la actualidad existe un nuevo escenario mundial en el que ha variado el lugar de Ir\u00e1n. Y que este \u201cnuevo mundo\u201d favorecer\u00eda -en cierto modo- la consecuci\u00f3n de este plan criminal, dado que hay intereses y coyunturas que exigen acercarse a Ir\u00e1n, que necesitan \u201clavarle la cara\u201d y demandan el surgimiento de \u201cnuevos enemigos\u201d. Este nuevo escenario pod\u00eda contribuir a la credibilidad de la versi\u00f3n inventada para desvincular a los imputados iran\u00edes de la causa AMIA.\nMientras Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez aseguraba p\u00fablicamente que no iba a permitir \u201c...que esta desgracia terrible que nos sucedi\u00f3 a los argentinos sea utilizada como pieza de ajedrez en el tablero internacional...\u201d o \u201c...para fines de la geopol\u00edtica internacional...\u201d; uno de sus c\u00f3mplices, \u201cAlian\u201d, reconoc\u00eda a trav\u00e9s de los canales paralelos que: . .ya estamos en otro pa\u00eds, es otra situaci\u00f3n mundial y hay que trabajar en otro contexto...\u201d (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 01/06/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-06-01-224726-18, CD 43). Existe un nuevo contexto mundial, \u201cestamos en otro pa\u00eds\u201d y se hab\u00eda advertido la necesidad de construir un nuevo culpable por el atentado contra la AMIA. Ya no serv\u00eda imputar a los ciudadanos iran\u00edes, aunque fueran verdaderamente los responsables del atentado, sino que se pretend\u00eda recomponer los v\u00ednculos con Ir\u00e1n y con la comunidad iran\u00ed local. Las pruebas as\u00ed lo demuestran. Se ha revelado que: \u201c...va a venir otra hip\u00f3tesis con otras pruebas...\u201d (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 01/06/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009- 2013-06-01-224726-18, CD 43).\nEs decir, las responsabilidades se iban a determinar por las necesidades pol\u00edticas y geopol\u00edticas internacionales de los autores. Poco import\u00f3 lo que indica la prueba. Todo estaba arreglado: se iba a usar el caso AMIA como una pieza para saciar intereses geopol\u00edticos en el nuevo tablero mundial. Vaya iron\u00eda las palabras de la Dra. Fern\u00e1ndez.\nY\tcuando aparezca esa nueva tesis y sus pruebas falsas, se dijo que el suscripto iba a quedar totalmente descolocado \u201c...porque nunca las vio, \u00e9l, las pruebas...lo que viene ahora...es una prueba contundente...\u201d (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 01/06/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009- 2013-06-01-224726-18, CD 43). Efectivamente, sab\u00edan que para deslegitimar al abajo firmante y a la investigaci\u00f3n llevada a cabo conforme a derecho, para avanzar con el encubrimiento de los acusados iran\u00edes, necesitaban inventar una nueva -y falsa- hip\u00f3tesis, con \u201cpruebas nunca vistas\u201d, nunca siquiera presentadas a la causa.\nEs decir, los part\u00edcipes del encubrimiento sab\u00edan que se iba a presentar una nueva hip\u00f3tesis sobre el atentado, pero con \u201cotras pruebas\u201d, m\u00e1s a\u00fan, pruebas nunca vistas por el suscripto. Se habl\u00f3 de la fabricaci\u00f3n de elementos probatorios falsos para buscar desacreditar la minuciosa investigaci\u00f3n vigente y as\u00ed deslegitimar la acusaci\u00f3n que involucra a los imputados iran\u00edes.\nAhora bien, resulta una obviedad se\u00f1alar que la nueva hip\u00f3tesis deb\u00eda parecer veros\u00edmil. En consecuencia, se decidi\u00f3 recurrir a ciertos individuos que hab\u00edan tenido contacto con la investigaci\u00f3n del caso AMIA, como el caso del otrora Fiscal Federal y ex Juez Nacional de Instrucci\u00f3n, H\u00e9ctor Luis Yrimia. Este contacto tuvo por fin obtener datos objetivos de la causa que tomaran veros\u00edmil lo falso.\nEl Dr. Yrimia intervino como fiscal en los primeros y trascendentales momentos de la pesquisa . Ha tenido acceso al expediente y ha podido contribuir con informaci\u00f3n para inventar una hip\u00f3tesis con apoyo en elementos que ya se encuentren incorporados a la causa, lo que conllevar\u00eda un mayor grado de credibilidad para la versi\u00f3n inventada.\nAdvi\u00e9rtase que en noviembre de 2012, mucho antes de la suscripci\u00f3n de ning\u00fan pacto con Ir\u00e1n, Jorge \u201cYussuf\u201d Khalil ya se hab\u00eda reunido con el Dr. Yrimia. As\u00ed lo relat\u00f3: \u201c...tengo un par de cosas que contarte...tuve una charla con el fiscal...El fiscal de la causa...el que estaba, no el que est\u00e1 ahora... El que sabe es \u00e9ste que te digo... el fiscal de la causaPara luego se\u00f1alar que el contacto con Yrimia le habr\u00eda llegado a trav\u00e9s de Fernando Esteche: \u201c...

Se necesita elegir la mejor, las m\u00e1s cre\u00edble, para ello necesitan informaci\u00f3n veraz y el Dr. Yrimia ha sido una de las fuentes que se ha prestado a proveerla, justamente, porque estuvo en una posici\u00f3n privilegiada de contacto directo con el expediente a ra\u00edz de su funci\u00f3n como Fiscal del caso AMIA.\nEn suma, para la elaboraci\u00f3n de la \u201cnueva hip\u00f3tesis\u201d, los part\u00edcipes tuvieron acceso al Dr. H\u00e9ctor Yrimia quien, a los fines del plan cuenta con las siguientes \u201ccredenciales\u201d: 1) un conocimiento personal espec\u00edfico sobre la causa del atentado, por haber sido, entre otros, uno de los primeros fiscales del caso; 2) se encuentra relacionado con el sector de la secretar\u00eda de inteligencia encargado del armado de la nueva hip\u00f3tesis falsa; 3) tiene relaci\u00f3n directa con el agente iran\u00ed Jorge \u201cYussuf\u2019 Khalil, gracias a la vinculaci\u00f3n de \u00e9ste \u00faltimo con Fernando Esteche; y 4) habla de ello en sus conversaciones con Jorge Khalil.\nNo caben dudas. Yrimia se encontraba en condiciones de aportar informaci\u00f3n de primera mano de la causa.

La impunidad hab\u00eda sido ya convenida previamente, por fuera al texto del acuerdo.\nEn s\u00edntesis, de las evidencias obtenidas se desprende que el sector de inteligencia dependiente directamente de Presidencia de la Naci\u00f3n, al que responde \u201cAlian\u201d, se aboc\u00f3 a la construcci\u00f3n de un nuevo enemigo, de una nueva hip\u00f3tesis que permitiera explicar el atentado de alg\u00fan modo que desvincule a los ciudadanos iran\u00edes acusados, en virtud del plan de encubrimiento que aqu\u00ed se denuncia.\nAs\u00ed, de los pasos que fueron siguiendo los part\u00edcipes del encubrimiento, se desprende que la construcci\u00f3n de la pista falsa que aleje la investigaci\u00f3n de Teher\u00e1n implic\u00f3 la fabricaci\u00f3n de pruebas que incriminen a terceros inocentes, y los convertir\u00edan en los nuevos imputados y, seg\u00fan todo el relato, los \u201cverdaderos culpables\u201d. Todo qued\u00f3 en espera por la negativa iran\u00ed a firmar el Memorando de Entendimiento, porque permanecieron vigentes las notificaciones rojas.\nComo se dijo al inicio, la maniobra de encubrimiento conlleva no solamente desvincular por medios fraudulentos a quienes han sido judicial y fundadamente imputados de un hecho criminal, sino que tambi\u00e9n implica incriminar falsamente a terceros.\nEl objetivo de construir esta falsa teor\u00eda alternativa ha sido contribuir a la desincriminaci\u00f3n de los acusados iran\u00edes y que finalice para ellos la pesadilla que comenz\u00f3 en el a\u00f1o 2007, cuando el suscripto logr\u00f3 en Interpol la aceptaci\u00f3n de las capturas con notificaciones rojas para los acusados. Los part\u00edcipes del encubrimiento as\u00ed lo entend\u00edan. Prueba de ello es lo que expresaban al respecto: \u201c...la esencia del nudo, el n\u00facleo del nudo...es la inocencia de lr\u00e1n...\\o dem\u00e1s viene a colaci\u00f3n...\u201d, y tambi\u00e9n \u201c...es la inocencia de Ir\u00e1n con la inocencia de la comunidad como conexi\u00f3n local,...'\u2019'' (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 14/02/2013, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2013-02-14-164341 -10, CD 284).\nLa gravedad de estas acciones es fenomenal, m\u00e1xime si se tiene en cuenta que la decisi\u00f3n primigenia fue tomada por la m\u00e1s alta autoridad p\u00fablica nacional e involucra a su canciller, a un Diputado\nNacional, a cierto sector de la inteligencia argentina y a referentes locales ligados a funcionarios del gobierno, entre otros.\nFinalmente, mientras los part\u00edcipes de este hecho -algunos muy cercanos al entorno presidencial, como el caso de \u201cAlian\u201d, por ejemplo-, reconoc\u00edan, en\tprivado,\tque\tlos cambios en el escenario mundial\ndemandaban un nuevo posicionamiento respecto de Ir\u00e1n, que se traducir\u00eda en la invenci\u00f3n de nuevos responsables para el caso AMIA, con la consecuente remoci\u00f3n del obst\u00e1culo que, a entender de las autoridades argentinas, ha impedido la relaci\u00f3n bilateral; por su parte, la Sra. Presidente constru\u00eda un discurso oficial muy distinto a la realidad que manejaban los part\u00edcipes de su plan.\nEn\tefecto,\tCristina Fern\u00e1ndez afirmaba p\u00fablicamente:\n\u201c...jam\u00e1s permitiremos que la tragedia AMIA sea utilizada como pieza de ajedrez en el tablero de intereses geopol\u00edticos ajenos'''' (Mensaje de twitter de la cuenta de Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez del 27 de enero de 2013 10:32). Y agregaba: \u201cNo voy a permitir que esta desgracia terrible que nos sucedi\u00f3 a los argentinos\tsea utilizada\tcomo pieza de ajedrez en el tablero\ninternacionar e insist\u00eda:\t\u201cYo\tno voy a permitir que nadie utilice la\ndesgracia y la tragedia de los argentinos para fines de la geopol\u00edtica internacionar (cuenta de twitter de Cristina Kirchner, 04/03/2013 5:08 PM; Mensaje de la Presidenta Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez a la Asamblea Legislativa con motivo de la apertura del 131\u00b0 per\u00edodo de sesiones ordinarias del Congreso de la Naci\u00f3n del 1/03/2013).\nEn este encadenado rosario de mentiras, la mandataria fue secundada -justamente- por su canciller, quien, meses antes, hab\u00eda emitido un comunicado desde el Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores que, anunciando un cuarto intermedio en las negociaciones oficiales, rezaba: \u201c...El Gobierno Nacional ratifica que el \u00fanico compromiso es con las v\u00edctimas y el derecho de sus familiares a hallar en la verdad y en la justicia la reparaci\u00f3n debida. Argentina reafirma que en dicho objetivo no hay lugar para intereses geopol\u00edticos, ni propios, ni ajenos...'''' (Ministerio de\nRelaciones Exteriores y Culto, Comunicado de Prensa N\u00b0360/12, del 31/10/2012, el subrayado es propio).\nNi el discurso de la Presidente ni el comunicado del Canciller se ajustaban a la verdad. Ellos mismos eran los protagonistas de un plan que sacrific\u00f3 la causa por el atentado a la AMIA en pos de intereses ajenos a la b\u00fasqueda de justicia.\nUna Presidente que, p\u00fablicamente, se regodea manifestando a los sobrevivientes y a los familiares de las v\u00edctimas que busca verdad y justicia; que declara que no va a permitir que se utilice el caso AMIA en el ajedrez de la geopol\u00edtica mundial; que ha tomado cartas en el asunto porque la causa estaba paralizada, cuando en realidad, ha dado la orden de desarticular la causa y encubrir a los acusados. Da pavor, entonces, constatar que todo se trata de actuaci\u00f3n y manipulaci\u00f3n de hechos y personas pues, lo cierto es que esa misma Presidente ha ordenado a su Canciller, a funcionarios de su servicio de inteligencia y a personas afines a su gobierno que ejecuten un plan delictivo, decidido por ella misma, y que construyan una hip\u00f3tesis falsa para terminar con la acusaci\u00f3n a los iran\u00edes en el expediente AMIA.\nd)\tIndicios de un acuerdo secreto firmado con Ir\u00e1n por fuera del Memorando de Entendimiento\nAl anunciar la suscripci\u00f3n del acuerdo desde Ad\u00eds Abeba, Etiop\u00eda, el Ministro Timerman se vio en la necesidad de aclarar:\tEste\nacuerdo se logr\u00f3 en un di\u00e1logo directo con Ir\u00e1n y no existen cl\u00e1usulas secretas ni ning\u00fan otro tema con el gobierno de ese pa\u00eds... \u201d (Declaraciones de Timerman al finalizar el acuerdo con su par de Ir\u00e1n para investigar el atentado de la AMIA, Casa Rosada, Presidencia de la Naci\u00f3n, 27/01/2013).\nNo se entend\u00eda cu\u00e1l era la raz\u00f3n para semejante aclaraci\u00f3n. Se supone que este acuerdo no deber\u00eda contener cl\u00e1usulas secretas u ocultas.\nEl correr de los meses le otorgar\u00eda el verdadero sentido a aquella manifestaci\u00f3n preventiva del Canciller. En mayo de 2013, cuando\nJorge \u201cYussuf\u201d Khalil comunic\u00f3 la desaz\u00f3n que hab\u00eda encontrado en Teher\u00e1n por el tema de las notificaciones rojas, expuso llanamente lo que realmente hab\u00eda ocurrido, al decir: \u201c...hay un poquito de...esto entre nosotros ...hay un poquito de desaz\u00f3n de all\u00e1... Desaz\u00f3n...si, si, si...me parece que....Me parece que el ruso este de mierda se mand\u00f3 alguna...estaba firmado algo, donde estaba el tema de las cautelares  tambi\u00e9n parece...\u201d (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 11/5/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-05-1 l-083146-8.wav, CD 0022).\nLas palabras de Khalil dejan entrever la existencia de otro documento firmado en el que estaba incluido el tema de la baja de las notificaciones rojas de Interpol. Es decir, un documento m\u00e1s amplio que lo incluido en la letra del memorando de entendimiento del 27 de enero de 2013.\nEsto se corrobora con las declaraciones del canciller iran\u00ed Salehi quien en marzo de 2013 expres\u00f3: \u201c...El  del acuerdo entre Ir\u00e1n y Argentina en relaci\u00f3n con la cuesti\u00f3n de la AMIA ser\u00e1 hecho p\u00fablico en el momento adecuado y la cuesti\u00f3n  est\u00e1 incluida y nosotros la estamos siguiendo...\u201d, en obvia alusi\u00f3n a un pacto distinto al memorando (\u201cTehran insists accord with Argentina includes interpol lifting red notices against Iranian suspects\u201d, Mercopress, 19/03/2013).\nA ello debe sumarse otro episodio revelador de la existencia de pactos secretos entre ambas partes. Hubo indicios certeros que pusieron en duda que verdaderamente se fueran a llevar a cabo las audiencias en Teher\u00e1n, aun cuando las mismas ni siquiera constituyeran verdaderas declaraciones indagatorias para la ley argentina. De hecho, el vocero de la canciller\u00eda iran\u00ed, Ramin Mehmanparast, declar\u00f3: \u201c...El tema de la indagatoria de un responsable iran\u00ed  es totalmente falso...Parece que los que se inquietan por este acuerdo difunden este tipo de informaciones...\u201d (\u201cIr\u00e1n ratific\u00f3 su adhesi\u00f3n plena al memor\u00e1ndum con Argentina\u201d, P\u00e1gina 12, 12/02/2013). Los medios informaron al respecto que: \u201c...El portavoz del Ministerio de Asuntos Exteriores de Ir\u00e1n, Ramin Mehmanparast, dijo que la solicitud para la interrogaci\u00f3n de algunos de los funcionarios de la Rep\u00fablica Isl\u00e1mica de Ir\u00e1n en el marco de la revisi\u00f3n del caso AMIA, no es cierta...\u201d (\u201cMehmanparast: solicitud para interrogar a funcionarios iran\u00edes sobre el caso AMIA, es falsa\u201d, IR1B, 11/02/2013).\nAl d\u00eda siguiente, el Canciller Salehi declar\u00f3: \u201c...Hemos firmado un acuerdo con la Argentina sobre la soluci\u00f3n del caso AMIA y las dos partes se han comprometido a ello...\u201d (\u201cEl canciller de Ir\u00e1n dice que negoci\u00f3 durante dos a\u00f1os el acuerdo con Argentina\u201d, Clar\u00edn, 12/02/2013).\nEntonces, para intentar aquietar la nueva pol\u00e9mica en ciernes, en pleno tratamiento parlamentario del acuerdo, el Ministro Timerman brind\u00f3 al siguiente explicaci\u00f3n sobre las declaraciones de los iran\u00edes, dirigi\u00e9ndose a un Senador de la Naci\u00f3n: \u201c... Usted dijo que ayer el gobierno iran\u00ed neg\u00f3 que se vaya a interrogar a los sospechosos \u00a1qui\u00e9n lo dijo? Un vocero. \u00bfSus voceros hablan por usted o usted habla por usted? Porque el canciller iran\u00ed, el doctor Salehi, una hora despu\u00e9s, dijo que Ir\u00e1n va a cumplir con todos los puntos del Memor\u00e1ndum \u00a1Le cree m\u00e1s a los voceros que al propio canciller?...\u201d (Palabras de H\u00e9ctor Timerman, versi\u00f3n taquigr\u00e1fica del Plenario de Comisiones, C\u00e1mara de Senadores, Honorable Congreso de la Naci\u00f3n, del d\u00eda 13 de febrero de 2013).\nPero era una falacia. Una m\u00e1s. Salehi no hab\u00eda desmentido lo que afirm\u00f3 su propio vocero. Ser\u00eda extra\u00f1o. Su portavoz hab\u00eda transmitido un mensaje importante y certero. Salehi solo hab\u00eda reafirmado su compromiso a cumplir el pacto y ello, en modo alguno significaba que el entonces Ministro de Defensa tuviera que comparecer a las audiencias previstas en el acuerdo.\nCon su fallido intento de interpretar la voluntad \u00edntima del r\u00e9gimen iran\u00ed mejor que los funcionarios persas, el Canciller Timerman ocult\u00f3 lo que verdaderamente estaba ocurriendo: la ejecuci\u00f3n del plan encubridor aqu\u00ed expuesto.\nDe hecho, la prueba fehaciente de la existencia de un pacto secreto entre Salehi y Timerman por el cual se acord\u00f3 que Ahmad Vahidi\njam\u00e1s concurriera a esas audiencias, surge de la comunicaci\u00f3n entre Jorge Khalil y Luis D'El\u00eda que se transcribe a continuaci\u00f3n:\nD\u2019El\u00eda: Ah\u00ed infobae est\u00e1 tirando que rechazaron la indagatoria de Vahidi \u00bfqu\u00e9 sab\u00e9s?\nKhalil: No, no s\u00e9 nada Luis.\nD\u2019El\u00eda: \u00bfeh?\nKhalil: No s\u00e9 nada.\nD\u2019El\u00eda:\tPorque viste, esto va.....justo un d\u00eda antes del debate\nparlamentario...\nKhalil: Pero....eh...\nD\u2019El\u00eda: \u00bfNo ser\u00e1 pescado podrido eso?\nKhalil: Si, pescado podrido.

Tambi\u00e9n se acord\u00f3 que, en la pr\u00e1ctica, el entonces Ministro de Defensa iran\u00ed y actual pr\u00f3fugo de la justicia argentina, Ahmad Vahidi, jam\u00e1s se sentar\u00eda a prestar declaraci\u00f3n, sin importar lo que dijese la letra del Memorando. Ello estaba acordado entre las partes, ya hab\u00eda sido \u201cconversado antes \u201d y, seg\u00fan se sugiere de la conversaci\u00f3n, el acuerdo era \u201cm\u00e1s profundo todav\u00eda\nEsta prueba revela, en forma contundente, la existencia de acuerdos secretos por fuera de la letra del memorando, alguno de ellos escritos y firmados, que incluyen cuestiones que no pueden trascender a la opini\u00f3n p\u00fablica. Ello contribuye, a la acreditaci\u00f3n del plan aqu\u00ed denunciado, dado que todo lo que abiertamente concierne al mismo ha sido -en principio- escondido del escrutinio p\u00fablico.\ne)\tMohsen Rabbani y el plan de impunidad\nDurante este plan criminal, los distintos avances fueron inmediatamente comunicados a uno de los pr\u00f3fugos de la justicia argentina, acusado por su participaci\u00f3n en el atentado contra la sede de la AMIA y beneficiario directo del encubrimiento que se denuncia: Mohsen Rabbani. Cada paso del plan y cada mensaje que lleg\u00f3 a conocimiento del agente de Teher\u00e1n en Buenos Aires, Jorge Khalil, fueron comunicados al imputado Mohsen Rabbani.\nSe han registrado comunicaciones telef\u00f3nicas que constituyen insoslayables ejemplos de ello: \u201c...hoy terminamos una reuni\u00f3n con el Ministro de Planificaci\u00f3n De Vido, en donde \u00e9l est\u00e1 dispuesto a mandar a las m\u00e1ximas autoridades de YPF para arreglar con la Rep\u00fablica Isl\u00e1mica y la transacci\u00f3n puede ser a trav\u00e9s de granos y a trav\u00e9s de otras cosas...\u201d, a lo que Rabbani respondi\u00f3:\t\u201c...M\u00e1ndame para que eval\u00fae...\u201d\n(Comunicaci\u00f3n del 20/5/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009- 2013-05-20-114842-2, CD 31).\nAs\u00ed, las propuestas del gobierno argentino fueron puestas a evaluaci\u00f3n y decisi\u00f3n de uno de los acusados por el atentado terrorista quien, luego de evaluarlo, contest\u00f3: \u201c...aqu\u00ed hay algunos sectores del gobierno que me dijeron que est\u00e1n listos para vender petr\u00f3leo a la Argentina...y tambi\u00e9n comprar armas...\u201d (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 28/5/13, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-05-28-155549-2, CD 39).\nEsto demuestra varias cuestiones.\nPrimero, Rabbani goza de un enorme poder decisorio y peso pol\u00edtico dentro del r\u00e9gimen, lo cual le ha permitido intervenir personalmente en las negociaciones con sus encubridores. Este imputado pr\u00f3fugo tiene capacidad de decisi\u00f3n en las cuestiones comerciales entre ambos Estados que, como tambi\u00e9n se ha denunciado, constituyeron un motor central para avanzar con este encubrimiento. Todo esto indica que el mism\u00edsimo Rabbani ha intervenido indirectamente -a trav\u00e9s de intermediarios como Jorge Khalil- en las negociaciones comerciales que motorizaron, nada m\u00e1s y nada menos que su propio encubrimiento. Y todo ello, a espaldas del conocimiento p\u00fablico.\nSegundo y teniendo en cuenta que la reuni\u00f3n con el Ministro Julio De Vido fue llevada a cabo \u201cporque lo pidi\u00f3 la jefa \u201d (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 20/5/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-05-20- 111124-8, CD 31), queda probado uno de los modos en que los mensajes y las propuestas enviadas por Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez, a trav\u00e9s de su Ministro de Planificaci\u00f3n Federal Julio De Vido, del operador Luis D'El\u00eda y del nexo con Teher\u00e1n, Jorge Khalil, llegaron al imputado Mohsen Rabbani. En otras palabras, la Sra. Presidente de la Naci\u00f3n Dra. Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez negoci\u00f3, por interp\u00f3sitas personas, con el pr\u00f3fugo Mohsen Rabbani, sobre distintas cuestiones vinculadas al encubrimiento que los un\u00eda en la dupla delictiva de encubridora y encubierto.\nTercero. El caso aqu\u00ed registrado permite demostrar que mientras p\u00fablicamente la Dra. Fern\u00e1ndez aseguraba que el acuerdo ven\u00eda a contribuir con la causa judicial; secreta y clandestinamente negociaba petr\u00f3leo con uno de los sospechosos del mayor acto terrorista que sufri\u00f3 nuestro pa\u00eds. Y Rabbani, en vez de estar preocupado por su situaci\u00f3n procesal, orquestaba la negociaci\u00f3n por petr\u00f3leo impulsada por la Sra. Presidenta, en torno a su propio encubrimiento, encarando la posibilidad de comprar armas a la Argentina.\nCuarto. Esta posibilidad de comprar armas a la Argentina fue comunicada por Mohsen Rabbani a una persona de su entorno, Adalberto\nAssad, quien ese mismo d\u00eda ven\u00eda de reunirse con un funcionario del gobierno argentino, quien iba intermediar para conseguirle una reuni\u00f3n personal con la Sra. Presidente (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 28/5/13, abonado 11- 3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-05-28-155549-2, CD 39).\nQuinto. Este intercambio telef\u00f3nico revela tambi\u00e9n que Mohsen Rabbani segu\u00eda y sigue de cerca las reuniones y negociaciones que giran en torno al acuerdo que, como aqu\u00ed se denuncia, tiene por norte -entre otras cuestiones- su encubrimiento personal. Gracias a Khalil, Rabbani estaba mejor informado que los familiares y v\u00edctimas del atentado, que la dirigencia jud\u00eda local y que las autoridades judiciales argentinas, ninguno de los cuales, al mes de mayo de 2013, conoc\u00eda estas tratativas.\nHay otros ejemplos de Mohsen Rabbani negociando, enviando mensajes a sus intermediarios, para que lleguen eventualmente al despacho presidencial: '''\u2018...Ir\u00e1n quiere buenas relaciones, nosotros verdad es as\u00ed, que Ir\u00e1n quiere buenas relaciones...Y eso que est\u00e1 Ir\u00e1n creciendo, entonces debe aprovechar lo m\u00e1s r\u00e1pido y posible ahora que ellos quieren...\u201d.

Presidente, el Sr. Canciller y otros part\u00edcipes del encubrimiento han llevado adelante para cumplir acabadamente con su plan delictivo.\nV.- Acciones para impulsar el plan criminal:\na)\tLa campa\u00f1a del descr\u00e9dito\nEl plan encubridor incluy\u00f3 paralelamente una estrategia medi\u00e1tica y discursiva destinada a horadar la credibilidad de la justicia argentina y de los funcionarios a cargo de la investigaci\u00f3n del atentado, achac\u00e1ndoles que la causa se encontraba paralizada, adem\u00e1s de falta de objetividad y fundamentalmente permeabilidad a la influencia de intereses ajenos a la b\u00fasqueda de la verdad y la justicia.\nSe trat\u00f3 de una verdadera y, por cierto, nefasta campa\u00f1a de descr\u00e9dito a la actual investigaci\u00f3n judicial del caso AMIA, en lo que ha sido otro de los medios para concretar el plan encubridor, dado que la deslegitimaci\u00f3n de la acusaci\u00f3n permite presentar, p\u00fablicamente, y dar verosimilitud a las \u201cnuevas hip\u00f3tesis\u201d y a los \u201cnuevos\u201d autores del hecho y, de esa forma, permitir la desvinculaci\u00f3n de los acusados iran\u00edes y, principalmente, de Teher\u00e1n, de todo involucramiento terrorista en el caso. El descr\u00e9dito no es inocuo, sino que contribuye a la finalidad del encubrimiento aqu\u00ed denunciado.\na.\t1) La causa est\u00e1 11armada \u201d\nEste clich\u00e9 ha sido la primera punta de lanza para intentar cuestionar la certera investigaci\u00f3n judicial argentina que ha logrado determinar, en gran medida, los responsables del atentado ocurrido en Buenos Aires el 18 de julio de 1994. Por otra parte, ha sido desde siempre la versi\u00f3n oficial del r\u00e9gimen de Teher\u00e1n. Simplemente, una estrategia comunicacional y de defensa que, para la Rep\u00fablica Isl\u00e1mica de Ir\u00e1n, ha resultado exitosa.\nSeg\u00fan esta falsa premisa, existen intereses extranjeros promovidos por facciones pol\u00edticas procedentes de Israel y/o Estados Unidos que han logrado influenciar y manipular a la justicia argentina para que fabrique la acusaci\u00f3n que involucra a ciudadanos iran\u00edes en el atentado contra la AMIA, con el objeto de deslegitimar y da\u00f1ar la reputaci\u00f3n internacional de la Rep\u00fablica Isl\u00e1mica de Ir\u00e1n, atribuy\u00e9ndole la responsabilidad por un hecho de terrorismo en Sudam\u00e9rica.\nNinguna prueba existe de estas acusaciones hechas a la ligera. No podr\u00eda haberla tampoco pues sencillamente la pretendida manipulaci\u00f3n de potencias extranjeras nunca sucedi\u00f3 y las conclusiones de la investigaci\u00f3n son, ni m\u00e1s ni menos, que el resultado del an\u00e1lisis de la prueba que obra en el expediente. Que la evidencia reunida guste o no a determinado sector o pa\u00eds es una cuesti\u00f3n absolutamente ajena al suscripto.\nAhora bien, a partir de la puesta en marcha del plan de encubrimiento por parte de ciertas autoridades del gobierno argentino, la campa\u00f1a de descr\u00e9dito, hasta ese momento exclusivamente orquestada desde Teher\u00e1n, experiment\u00f3 un sutil giro que le ha otorgado una impronta distinta. Las m\u00e1s altas autoridades de la naci\u00f3n, incluida la Presidente y el Canciller, lejos de oponerse a la ret\u00f3rica iran\u00ed parecieron adherirse a ella y contribuyeron a aumentar las expresiones de deslegitimaci\u00f3n y descr\u00e9dito.\nAnteriormente, Luis D'El\u00eda hab\u00eda actuado como vocero local de esta versi\u00f3n, pero ello le cost\u00f3 su puesto en el gobierno de N\u00e9stor Kirchner, que no permiti\u00f3 que ninguno de sus funcionarios pusiera infundadamente en duda las conclusiones del Poder Judicial y el Ministerio P\u00fablico Fiscal. D'El\u00eda nunca dej\u00f3 de comunicar esta versi\u00f3n falsa y deslegitimadora.\nEn ese contexto, mientras D'El\u00eda operaba aseverando que intereses extranjeros hab\u00edan logrado influenciar y manipular a la justicia argentina para fabricar la acusaci\u00f3n contra Ir\u00e1n, la Sra. Presidente reforzaba la ret\u00f3rica a trav\u00e9s de su cuenta de \u201ctwitter\u201d, manifestando: \u201c...jam\u00e1s permitiremos que la tragedia AMIA sea utilizada como pieza de ajedrez en el tablero de intereses geopoliticos ajenos\u201d (Mensaje de twitter de la cuenta de Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez del 27 de enero de 2013 10:32). Esta frase fue celebrada por el mismo D'El\u00eda, quien destac\u00f3 que la Sra. Presidente hab\u00eda hecho referencia a la utilizaci\u00f3n del tema AMIA en cuestiones geopol\u00edticas de otros Estados (\u201cCausa AMIA: Para D'El\u00eda, los acusados iran\u00edes van a ser sobrese\u00eddos\u201d, Infobae, 1/3/2013).\nConsterna constatar que la causa AMIA, a contramano de lo expresado por la Presidente Fern\u00e1ndez, fue usufructuada como pieza de cambio para lograr el restablecimiento de la relaci\u00f3n comercial bilateral con la Rep\u00fablica Isl\u00e1mica de Ir\u00e1n, en funci\u00f3n de un cambio en la visi\u00f3n geopol\u00edtica.\na.\t2) La causa est\u00e1 paralizada\nCon el objeto de lograr el apoyo de la opini\u00f3n p\u00fablica y el aval parlamentario, estrat\u00e9gicamente se intent\u00f3 presentar al Memorando de Entendimiento -pieza importante en el plan encubridor- como la \u00fanica alternativa posible para avanzar en la causa, como el camino que hab\u00eda que transitar, no porque fuera ideal -nadie podr\u00eda creer que lo fuera- sino porque ya no quedaban otras alternativas y no hab\u00eda nada que perder.\nDe esa manera, se pretendi\u00f3 instalar la idea de que la causa judicial por el atentado se encontraba completamente paralizada desde hace a\u00f1os. Con esta afirmaci\u00f3n, totalmente falsa, se busc\u00f3 estrat\u00e9gicamente crear el \u00e1nimo en el p\u00fablico de que el memorando aportaba la \u00fanica posibilidad de avanzar en la causa y que, si bien no era ideal y ciertos aspectos eran perfectibles, era mejor que la par\u00e1lisis del expediente. En suma, falso pero se dijo que no se perd\u00eda nada intentando esta opci\u00f3n.\nSCAL\nPara sostener este argumento, Timerman dijo: \u201c...Por primera vez hay un compromiso por escrito de Ir\u00e1n...para que la causa \u201cAMIA \u201d pueda salir de la total par\u00e1lisis actual en la que se encuentra. Repito, la total par\u00e1lisis actual en la que se encuentra...\u201d y, luego, aclar\u00f3 que se refer\u00eda al \u201c....proceso judicial en curso, que no ha tenido avances de ning\u00fan tipo en los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os\u201d y advirti\u00f3 a los legisladores: \u201cSer\u00e1n ustedes quienes decidan si la causa avanza o sigue paralizada''\u2019 y posteriormente agreg\u00f3: \u201cLa causa est\u00e1 paralizada desde el a\u00f1o 2006\u201d y \u201cLe recuerdo que van 19 a\u00f1os sin que hayamos logrado un avance significativo\u201d (Versi\u00f3n taquigr\u00e1fica del Plenario de las Comisiones de Relaciones Exteriores, Asuntos Constitucionales y de Justicia y Asuntos Penales de la C\u00e1mara de Senadores desarrollado el 13 de febrero de 2013).\nSimilares expresiones repiti\u00f3 ante el plenario de comisiones de la C\u00e1mara de Diputados (cfr. versi\u00f3n taquigr\u00e1fica del Plenario de las Comisiones de Relaciones Exteriores, Justicia y Asuntos Constitucionales de la C\u00e1mara de Diputados, Congreso Nacional, desarrollado el 26 de febrero de 2013).\nPor su parte, en su discurso ante la Asamblea General de Naciones Unidas, la Sra. Presidente afirm\u00f3: \u201c...la causa est\u00e1 estancada, desde hace 19 a\u00f1os no se moviliza...\u201d (Discurso de Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez, 68\u00b0 Asamblea General de Naciones Unidas, 24 de septiembre de 2013). Y meses antes, al elevar el acuerdo con Ir\u00e1n al Congreso para su aprobaci\u00f3n, hab\u00eda aseverado en Cadena Nacional: \u201cEste Memor\u00e1ndum que hemos acordado es un paso adelante para destrabar una causa que hace 19 a\u00f1os est\u00e1 paralizada...\u2019''\u2019 (Discurso de Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez, Cadena Nacional del d\u00eda 08/02/2013).\nEn marzo de 2013, la Sra. Presidente escribi\u00f3 en las redes sociales: \u201cTen\u00edamos que destrabar esto\u201d, en alusi\u00f3n a la causa AMIA (ver twitter del 04/03/2013 5:05 PM) y ante la Asamblea Legislativa: \u201c...mi compromiso es intentar destrabar esto...''\u2019\u2019 (Mensaje de la Presidente Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez a la Asamblea Legislativa con motivo de la Apertura del 131\u00b0 per\u00edodo de sesiones ordinarias del Congreso de la Naci\u00f3n, 01/03/2013).\nEn l\u00ednea con la Presidente y el Canciller, otros funcionarios y representantes cercanos al entorno presidencial hicieron declaraciones de igual tenor. El entonces Senador Daniel Filmus sostuvo que el acuerdo \u201cdestraba la causa AMIA\u201d, la cual \u201cno se mueve desde 2006\u201d y agreg\u00f3 que si bien: \u201cno se puede garantizar el \u00e9xito cien por cien del memor\u00e1ndum, se sabe que la causa as\u00ed congelada va directo al fracaso\u201d (\u201cDuro cruce de acusaciones entre Timerman y Garc\u00eda Morit\u00e1n\u201d, La Naci\u00f3n, 19/02/2013). El Senador Nacional Miguel \u00c1ngel Pichetto, tambi\u00e9n afirm\u00f3 en su alocuci\u00f3n que \u201c...la causa tiene una par\u00e1lisis desde el a\u00f1o 2006...\u201d (Versi\u00f3n taquigr\u00e1fica del plenario de comisiones del Honorable Senado de la Naci\u00f3n, 13 de febrero de 2013).\nPor lo dem\u00e1s, tama\u00f1as falsedades obligan a quien suscribe a enumerar aqu\u00ed, aunque sea en forma somera, los significativos avances que ha tenido el expediente desde el a\u00f1o 2006, fecha en la cual se dictaron las \u00f3rdenes de captura internacional que fueran avaladas por amplia mayor\u00eda en la Asamblea General de Interpol en noviembre de 2007.\nAl a\u00f1o siguiente, 2008, se concluy\u00f3 la labor que dio lugar a la denuncia por otro encubrimiento verificado en este caso, que beneficiara al imputado de Alberto Jacinto Kanoore Edul y que actualmente se encuentra en etapa de juicio oral. A fines de 2008 se dictaron los embargos preventivos contra las propiedades de los acusados, resultando en la inhibici\u00f3n registral de algunos bienes que Mohsen Rabbani posee en nuestro pa\u00eds.\nEn 2009 la Fiscal\u00eda a cargo del abajo firmante emiti\u00f3 un nuevo dictamen relativo al atentado. All\u00ed se plasm\u00f3 el trabajo relacionado con la identificaci\u00f3n del coche bomba utilizado en el ataque y se explic\u00f3 en detalle el funcionamiento de la c\u00e9lula terrorista de Hezbollah que actu\u00f3 en la ejecuci\u00f3n material del hecho. Incluso se pudo establecer la identidad y la participaci\u00f3n del jefe de dicho grupo operativo, el liban\u00e9s Samuel Salman El Reda, a quien se le atribuye haber coordinado la llegada y la partida, las\n\nAl BERTO NISM\n.:!SCA'- \u00f3'\n\nMinisterio P\u00fablico de la Naci\u00f3n\noperaciones de log\u00edstica y las dem\u00e1s actividades desplegadas por el grupo operativo encargado de ejecutar la fase final del atentado. Sobre este sujeto tambi\u00e9n se dict\u00f3 orden de captura nacional e internacional y la m\u00e1xima prioridad de b\u00fasqueda de Interpol.\nEn ese pronunciamiento, se determin\u00f3 que El Reda era un miembro activo del Hezbollah liban\u00e9s, de una probada vinculaci\u00f3n con destacados personajes radicados en la Triple Frontera, pertenecientes a esa organizaci\u00f3n. La labor de esta Unidad Fiscal tambi\u00e9n logr\u00f3 demostrar que El Reda conoc\u00eda, cuanto menos desde 1987, la Ciudad de Buenos Aires y al imputado Mohsen Rabbani, y que su inserci\u00f3n en el medio local se fortaleci\u00f3 con su casamiento en 1989 con una mujer argentina: Silvina Sain. Esta vinculaci\u00f3n con Buenos Aires y, fundamentalmente, con Mohsen Rabbani, sumada a la pertenencia de El Reda al Hezbollah, permiti\u00f3 trazar un puente eficaz entre la agrupaci\u00f3n a nivel regional y el entonces gobierno de la Rep\u00fablica Isl\u00e1mica de Ir\u00e1n, cuyos m\u00e1ximos responsables pol\u00edticos fueron imputados por el atentado.\nLa prueba reunida reflej\u00f3 que, para el a\u00f1o del atentado, Samuel Salman El Reda resid\u00eda en la Ciudad de Foz de Iguaz\u00fa, pero que habitaba alternadamente entre esa localizaci\u00f3n y la vivienda de sus suegros en la Ciudad de Buenos Aires. Tal alternancia entre los domicilios de Brasil y Argentina fue aprovechada por el nombrado para desarrollar sus tareas, ya que no llamaba a sospecha en raz\u00f3n de sus contactos familiares.\nA su vez, se logr\u00f3 probar que El Reda estuvo en la Ciudad de Buenos Aires en diversas \u00e9pocas, y m\u00e1s precisamente, para la fecha pr\u00f3xima a la ejecuci\u00f3n del atentado; como as\u00ed tambi\u00e9n que el nombrado deliberadamente omit\u00eda dejar asentados sus movimientos migratorios, con el \u00fanico objetivo de dificultar eventuales investigaciones y el seguimiento de sus pasos, y en lo que respecta al atentado contra la sede de la AMIA, dicha ausencia de registro de sus comprobados traslados de un pa\u00eds a otro solo pudo ser entendida como una actividad enmarcada en la funci\u00f3n que llev\u00f3 adelante en esa operaci\u00f3n.\nOtra circunstancia acreditada por esta fiscal\u00eda, en lo que hace particularmente al protagonismo de El Reda en la ejecuci\u00f3n del ataque contra la mutual jud\u00eda, es su intervenci\u00f3n en las comunicaciones telef\u00f3nicas que efectu\u00f3, ya que teniendo en cuenta a qui\u00e9nes las realiz\u00f3, desde d\u00f3nde y cu\u00e1ndo las hizo, pudo concluirse que en tales contactos el nombrado transmiti\u00f3 informaci\u00f3n indispensable para la ejecuci\u00f3n del hecho y cumpli\u00f3 una funci\u00f3n de coordinaci\u00f3n en la llegada y la partida, las operaciones de log\u00edstica y las dem\u00e1s actividades desplegadas por el grupo operativo, ya sea respecto de los restantes agentes involucrados en la operaci\u00f3n que, como \u00e9l, actuaron a nivel local, como con quien lo hac\u00eda desde la zona de la Triple Frontera mediante un abonado celular a nombre de Andr\u00e9 Marques.\nTales comunicaciones fueron extrictamente necesarias e imprescindibles para que la operaci\u00f3n concluyera de la manera en que lo hizo, al punto que el operativo no hubiera podido arribar a su fase final de no ser por la intervenci\u00f3n de El Reda en los momentos y desde los lugares donde la llev\u00f3 a cabo.\nEn relaci\u00f3n a estas comunicaciones telef\u00f3nicas, se tuvo en cuenta, en primer lugar, que las mismas fueron efectuadas desde lugares estrat\u00e9gicos, en funci\u00f3n del atentado (terminales a\u00e9reas desde las que ingres\u00f3 y egres\u00f3, cuanto menos, parte de los ejecutores del plan, como as\u00ed tambi\u00e9n locutorios cercanos al objetivo). En segundo lugar, que fueron llamadas dirigidas, en algunos casos, a abonados correspondientes a centrales de comunicaciones de Hezbollah en Beirut (Rep\u00fablica del L\u00edbano), como as\u00ed tambi\u00e9n al abonado a nombre de Andr\u00e9 Marques, cuyo usuario se trat\u00f3 de un militante activo de Hezbollah, que tambi\u00e9n tuvo a su cargo la coordinaci\u00f3n de acciones y agentes desde la Triple Frontera. Y en tercer y \u00faltimo lugar, se consider\u00f3 tambi\u00e9n que los contactos se produjeron del Io al 18 de julio de 1994, habi\u00e9ndose probado previamente que el abonado a nombre de Marques solo hab\u00eda recibido comunicaciones desde nuestro pa\u00eds entre esas fechas, ni antes ni despu\u00e9s, lo que significa que ese tel\u00e9fono se activ\u00f3 durante un per\u00edodo determinado y con un objetivo\nconcreto: coordinar las tareas desarrolladas con el fin de atentado contra la sede de la AMIA.\nEn ese dictamen, qued\u00f3 probado que los dos primeros llamados al abonado a nombre de Andr\u00e9 Marques -Triple Frontera- se registraron el 1 de julio, desde cabinas localizadas en el Aeropuerto Internacional de Ezeiza, y el \u00faltimo, el 18 de julio, desde otra ubicada en el Aeroparque Metropolitano Jorge Newbery, tan solo dos horas antes de que estallara el artefacto explosivo que destruy\u00f3 el edificio de la AMIA.\nLa circunstancia de que tanto el primero como el \u00fatlimo llamado registrado hayan sido realizados desde sendos aeopuertos llev\u00f3 a concluir que se hab\u00eda informado al miembro activo de Hezbollah que operaba a nombre de Andr\u00e9 Marques, tanto la entrada como la salida de integrantes del grupo operativo que llevaron adelante la etapa final de la misi\u00f3n.\nEn definitiva, la labor de la Unidad Fiscal logr\u00f3 demostrar de manera s\u00f3lida y contundente que Samuel Salman El Reda tuvo un papel determinante en el marco del apoyo local con el que cont\u00f3 la operaci\u00f3n de atentar contra la sede de la AMIA.\nAsimismo, en ese dictamen se\tbrind\u00f3 un extenso informe, de\nm\u00e1s de cien\tp\u00e1ginas,\tacerca de las tareas de\testa Unidad Fiscal tendientes a\nindividualizar la carrocer\u00eda que se us\u00f3 para el armado del coche bomba que explot\u00f3 en la AMIA. Luego de la aplicaci\u00f3n de adecuados filtros para depurar los extensos listados estudiados y un riguroso an\u00e1lisis posterior, se logr\u00f3 reducir el n\u00famero posible de camionetas a cuatro unidades, entre las que -y as\u00ed se concluy\u00f3- se encuentra la utilizada para el armado del coche bomba.\nA partir\tde 2010 y a ra\u00edz de los pronunciamientos de la Corte\nSuprema\tde\tJusticia\tde la Naci\u00f3n y de la\tC\u00e1mara Nacional de Casaci\u00f3n\nPenal del a\u00f1o anterior, en relaci\u00f3n a la situaci\u00f3n procesal de Carlos Telleld\u00edn, se comenz\u00f3 la tarea de revisi\u00f3n de los elementos probatorios que surg\u00edan en contra del nombrado, lo que desemboc\u00f3 en un nueva solicitud de elevaci\u00f3n ajuicio respecto de Telleld\u00edn, en el mes de agosto de 2012.\nEn 2013, en virtud de la actividad investigativa realizada por esta fiscal\u00eda, que incluy\u00f3 la obtenci\u00f3n de testimonios en el extranjero, y de la prueba recolectada en los dos a\u00f1os anteriores -justamente relacionada con actividades ilegales de agentes al servicio del r\u00e9gimen de Teher\u00e1n- se emiti\u00f3 un nuevo pronunciamiento de m\u00e1s de 500 p\u00e1ginas, en el cual se estableci\u00f3 la modalidad del r\u00e9gimen iran\u00ed para infiltrar varios pa\u00edses de Sudam\u00e9rica e instalar all\u00ed estaciones de inteligencia destinadas a cometer, fomentar y patrocinar actos terroristas, en consonancia con sus postulados de exportaci\u00f3n de la revoluci\u00f3n.\nLa obtenci\u00f3n de esta informaci\u00f3n ha sido central para contextualizar, regional y estrat\u00e9gicamente, el atentado contra la sede de la AMIA, as\u00ed como tambi\u00e9n para acreditar con mayor detalle el rol del imputado Mohsen Rabbani en dicho ataque. En este dictamen, se demostr\u00f3 que el contexto en el que se llev\u00f3 adelante el atentado contra la mutual jud\u00eda, no se trat\u00f3 de un hecho aislado, sino que result\u00f3 ser un engranaje de un entramado mucho mayor, dominado por la pol\u00edtica de penetraci\u00f3n iran\u00ed en la regi\u00f3n.\nParalelamente a todas estas l\u00edneas de investigaci\u00f3n y sus correspondientes pronunciamientos, la Unidad Fiscal se encuentra diariamente abocada a la profundizaci\u00f3n de la pesquisa sobre el atentado, y ello queda plasmado en el cuerpo principal de la causa y, actualmente, en 27 legajos que corren por cuerda y se encuentran en pleno tr\u00e1mite.\nEs \u00fatil recordar que el Sr. Canciller tom\u00f3 conocimiento, a poco tiempo de asumir su funci\u00f3n ministerial, esto es, a mediados de 2010, que - entre los distintos frentes de la pesquisa- se estaba avanzando en una nueva l\u00ednea de investigaci\u00f3n relacionada con el imputado Mohsen Rabbani, su rol y su red de contactos a nivel regional, que luego desembocar\u00eda en el pronunciamiento de mayo de 2013. El Ministro dijo haber aportado un dato a la fiscal\u00eda sobre esta l\u00ednea de investigaci\u00f3n. Se refer\u00eda a una alerta del servidor \u201cgoogle\u201d, que hab\u00eda recibido por correo electr\u00f3nico. En sus palabras, Timerman declar\u00f3: \u201c...pude conectar que un atentado que se frustr\u00f3 en Estados Unidos al aeropuerto JFK involucraba a Mohsen\nRabbani, el que era agregado cultural de la embajada de Ir\u00e1n en Buenos Aires. No lo sab\u00eda ni Hillary Clinton ni la gente que investiga ac\u00e1. Ahora hay una conexi\u00f3n entre un atentado que se frustr\u00f3 en Estados Unidos y el de la AMIA...\u201d (Cibeira, Fernando. \u201cHay que relacionarse sin intermediarios\u201d Reportaje a H\u00e9ctor Timerman, Ministro de Relaciones Exteriores, P\u00e1gina 12, 9/01/2011).\nDe hecho, en sus presentaciones ante las comisiones parlamentarias del Congreso Nacional en ocasi\u00f3n en que se discut\u00eda la aprobaci\u00f3n de memorando de entendimiento, H\u00e9ctor Timerman record\u00f3: \u201c(...) el fiscal le va a decir qui\u00e9n le provey\u00f3 la principal prueba que tiene en este momento contra la Rep\u00fablica Isl\u00e1mica del Ir\u00e1n.

Sin embargo, tres meses despu\u00e9s, cruzaba los desiertos sirios para contactarse con Ir\u00e1n y negociar la suspensi\u00f3n de las investigaciones a cambio de retomar el flujo comercial entre Estados, sin dudar luego en justificar este curso de acci\u00f3n afirmando en repetidas ocasiones que la causa estaba \u201cparalizada\u201d.\nEsta falacia qued\u00f3 m\u00e1s expuesta aun el 29 de mayo de 2013, cuando la fiscal\u00eda a cargo del suscripto, como se adelant\u00f3 p\u00e1rrafos atr\u00e1s, emiti\u00f3 un extenso pronunciamiento -justamente, en relaci\u00f3n con la l\u00ednea de investigaci\u00f3n conocida por el Canciller Timerman- en el que se expusieron hechos y pruebas que permitieron saber en forma m\u00e1s acabada el contexto pol\u00edtico y regional en el que tuvo lugar el atentado contra la sede de la\n14\tSe refiere a la conexi\u00f3n entre el imputado por el caso AMIA: Mohsen Rabbani, y al actualmente condenado a prisi\u00f3n perpetua Abdul Kadir (fs. 133.113/133.416 de los autos principales).\nAMIA y, en particular, el rol de Mohsen Rabbani en el mismo (fs. 133.113/133.416). Al conocerse este documento, el Canciller vari\u00f3 su anterior postura y declar\u00f3: \u201cNo he visto mucho de novedoso\u201d, en un intento por deslucir las averiguaciones del Ministerio P\u00fablico, sin advertir que su dem\u00e9rito desacreditaba el aporte del que tanto se hab\u00eda vanagloriado ante los legisladores nacionales y que hasta -por su relevancia- hab\u00eda comunicado a la Secretaria de Estado norteamericana Sra. Hillary Clinton (Pisani, Silvia, \u201cEl Congreso de EEUU invit\u00f3 al fiscal Nisman por su informe de Ir\u00e1n\u201d, La Naci\u00f3n, 14 de junio de 2013).\nFinalmente, aseverar que \u201cno hay nada que perder\u201d constituye un nuevo enga\u00f1o argumentativo destinado a justificar el camino del memorando de entendimiento que, como hoy ya se sabe, es el camino de la impunidad de los acusados iran\u00edes por el atentado contra la AMIA. Cabe tener presente que pende sobre la causa la posibilidad de que, nuevamente, sea acribillada de nulidades si se avanza con acciones procesales no previstas por la ley y contrarias a la Constituci\u00f3n Nacional y los principios de derechos p\u00fablico previstos en ella. Es falso que no haya riesgos. En los hechos, como se ver\u00e1, ya se han producido perjuicios, pues terceros pa\u00edses han cesado, a partir de la firma del acuerdo, en el env\u00edo de informaci\u00f3n.\nConcluyendo, lo \u00fanico que necesita ser destrabado en esta causa es la firme negativa de Ir\u00e1n a extraditar a sus nacionales, para ponerlos a disposici\u00f3n de la justicia argentina. El memorando de entendimiento est\u00e1 lejos de solucionar este problema. La causa judicial no necesita \u201cdestrabarse\u201d y -menos aun- cabe aseverar de forma irresponsable y falaz que la misma se encuentre paralizada desde el a\u00f1o 2006, como se dijo. Semejantes afirmaciones s\u00f3lo pueden motivarse en lograr el desprestigio de la justicia argentina, en convalidar el memorando y -como se pudo determinar ahora- en avanzar con el plan encubridor en curso.\nb)\tLa campa\u00f1a del enga\u00f1o:\nLa tergiversaci\u00f3n medi\u00e1tica de la realidad procesal del expediente AMIA que la Sra. Presidente y el Sr. Canciller llevaron adelante en tomo al proceso de negociaci\u00f3n con la Rep\u00fablica Isl\u00e1mica de Ir\u00e1n fue necesaria, aunque no suficiente. Debi\u00f3 desplegarse, adem\u00e1s, toda una artiller\u00eda de falsedades, de promesas que los funcionarios nombrados sab\u00edan perfectamente que nunca cumplir\u00edan, de puestas en escenas y dem\u00e1s estrategias comunicacionales falaces, cuyo \u00fanico objetivo ha sido predisponer favorablemente a la opini\u00f3n p\u00fablica en relaci\u00f3n con la negociaci\u00f3n con Ir\u00e1n y, en particular, respecto al Memorando de Entendimiento, con el fin \u00faltimo de encubrir a los acusados y desvincularlos de la leg\u00edtima acusaci\u00f3n que pesa sobre ellos.\nCon ese norte, los encubridores han mentido sobre el momento en que verdaderamente se hab\u00edan iniciado las negociaciones, sobre la entidad de las cuestiones negociadas y sobre cu\u00e1l de las partes hab\u00eda propiciado e impulsado el acercamiento. Por los mismos motivos, se ocult\u00f3 la predisposici\u00f3n que evidenciaron los representantes argentinos para dejar a un lado la justicia en el caso AMIA en favor de la agenda comercial, as\u00ed como por razones geopol\u00edticas, falseando -de ese modo- los verdaderos motivos del pacto, es decir, los intereses subyacentes a esta decisi\u00f3n.\nPor ello tambi\u00e9n se recurri\u00f3 a intermediarios clandestinos y a reuniones \u201cpantalla\u201d para avanzar con la negociaci\u00f3n secreta. Por ello se desminti\u00f3 y se cuestion\u00f3 a la prensa cuando comunic\u00f3 circunstancias de la negociaci\u00f3n que se hab\u00edan pretendido mantener en secreto. Por ello se atac\u00f3 a ex funcionarios del gobierno que confirmaron la existencia de antecedentes al pacto que, justamente por sus implicancias ilegales, no hab\u00edan prosperado en el pasado. Por ello, se afirm\u00f3 falsamente, y con conocimiento de esa falsedad, que la causa judicial estaba paralizada, que no hab\u00eda otra salida ni nada que perder al apoyar al memorando. Estas fueron, en l\u00edneas generales, algunas de las acciones positivas que Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez, H\u00e9ctor Timerman y dem\u00e1s part\u00edcipes de este plan de encubrimiento llevaron adelante como parte de la campa\u00f1a de descr\u00e9dito.\nYa se han detallado los modos en que la Sra. Presidente y el Sr. Canciller intentaron justificar la negociaci\u00f3n con Ir\u00e1n diciendo que la causa se hallaba paralizada, cuando bien sab\u00edan que no era as\u00ed.\nAhora se detallar\u00e1n sus siguientes aportes al plan delictivo. Conociendo que el Memorando de Entendimiento se trataba simplemente de un disfraz jur\u00eddico para camuflar el encubrimiento de los pr\u00f3fugos iran\u00edes, la Sra. Presidente lo present\u00f3 como un \u201clogro hist\u00f3rico\u201d. El d\u00eda en que se firm\u00f3, en su cuenta oficial de \u201cTwitter\u201d, anunci\u00f3: \u201cHist\u00f3rico: Despu\u00e9s de casi 19 a\u00f1os del atentado AMIA se logra, x Io vez, instrumento legal de DERECHO INTERNACIONAL, entre Argentina/Ir\u00e1n ...Hist\u00f3rico: Porque se garantiza el derecho de debido proceso legal, principio fundamental del derecho penal internacional ...al conformarse comisi\u00f3n de verdad de cinco juristas internacionales de reconocido prestigio...Ninguno de ellos podr\u00e1 ser nacional de ninguno de los 2 pa\u00edses.

La Sra. Presidente dijo en su mensaje de elevaci\u00f3n del anteproyecto de ley de aprobaci\u00f3n del memorando al Congreso Nacional que: \u201c...Se quiere presentar el acuerdo como una especie de argucia para \u201ciniciar \u201d el comercio con Ir\u00e1n. Lo cierto es que ese comercio existe desde 1990 y, salvo los a\u00f1os 2004 y 2005, ha sido superavitario...\u201d (Mensaje Presidencial N\u00b0173 de elevaci\u00f3n al Congreso Nacional del anteproyecto de ley sobre el Memorando de Entendimiento entre Argentina e Ir\u00e1n).\nEs cierto que el flujo entre privados de ambos pa\u00edses ven\u00eda increment\u00e1ndose, pero el verdadero inter\u00e9s radicaba en restablecer las relaciones comerciales de Estado a Estado. Much\u00edsimas son las comunicaciones telef\u00f3nicas registradas que dan cuenta de ello en los niveles m\u00e1s altos del gobierno. Son cosas bien diferentes el comercio entre privados que los acuerdos entre Estados. Entonces, argumentar por una situaci\u00f3n nunca responde por la otra.\nPor lo dem\u00e1s, cabe recordar las palabras de quien fuera Canciller de N\u00e9stor Kirchner, Rafael Bielsa, cuando afirm\u00f3 que Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez \u201c...le dice a los familiares que los que comercian son las empresas y no el Estado. Me parece un argumento pelotudo, me fastidia mucho porque era un tema sagrado para N\u00e9stor...\u201d, y agreg\u00f3: \u201cCuando era canciller, hablar de venderle o comprarle a Ir\u00e1n era casus bell\u00ed\\ (el resaltado es propio, Dobry, Hern\u00e1n, \u201cCancilleres K: el acuerdo con Ir\u00e1n ya hab\u00eda sido rechazado\u201d, Perfil, 23/02/2013).\nEn este enga\u00f1o, Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez fue secundada con \u00e9nfasis por el Canciller Timerman, quien en varias oportunidades afirm\u00f3 que el pacto no tuvo ninguna motivaci\u00f3n econ\u00f3mica y para demostrarlo, se\u00f1al\u00f3: \u201cMe ofende que Ud. invente lo de los intereses econ\u00f3micos....\u00a1C\u00f3mo voy a hacer algo que est\u00e1 prohibido por las Naciones Unidas?...porque si Ud. supiera, hubiera le\u00eddo las sanciones de las Naciones Unidas, y se dar\u00eda cuenta que es imposible lo que Ud. est\u00e1 planteando, pero como Ud. no ley\u00f3 las sanciones de las Naciones Unidas, simplemente repite lo que escucha por ah\u00ed....no puede haber intereses econ\u00f3micos ...porque hay sanciones econ\u00f3micas impuestas por las Naciones Unidas, de las cuales la Argentina es suscripta, que impiden el comercio con Ir\u00e1n m\u00e1s all\u00e1 del que se est\u00e1 realizando , que es en granos, y eso no lo hace el gobierno argentino...lo hacen las empresas privadas ....yo les ped\u00ed que no lo hagan...\u201d (Tenembaum, Ernesto, Tierra de Locos, entrevista a H\u00e9ctor Timerman, 18/02/2013).\nEn otra oportunidad, asever\u00f3: \u201c... \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 no puede vender el petr\u00f3leo Ir\u00e1n?

Todas las resoluciones que el Consejo de Seguridad de las Naciones Unidas ha dictado impidiendo a los pa\u00edses miembros a comerciar con la Rep\u00fablica Isl\u00e1mica de Ir\u00e1n se han referido art\u00edculos, materiales, equipos, bienes y tecnolog\u00edas relacionadas con el enriquecimiento, reprocesamiento de minerales nucleares o agua pesada, o con el desarrollo de sistemas de vectores de armas nucleares13.Una nueva mentira del Sr. Timerman, que viene a engrosar la larga lista de enga\u00f1os de los que debi\u00f3 valerse para intentar -con escaso \u00e9xito, por cierto- ocultar el delito del que fue part\u00edcipe.\nDe hecho, el 16 de diciembre de 2010, en el marco de la 40a Cumbre del Mercosur celebrada en Foz de Iguaz\u00fa, se anunci\u00f3 la suscripci\u00f3n de un convenio de libre comercio con Ir\u00e1n (Levinas, Gabriel, op.

Esta circunstancia fue posteriormente desmentida por el canciller, quien explic\u00f3: \u201c...Es falso, una mentira, una infamia que el Mercosur est\u00e9 siquiera pensando hacer un Tratado de Libre Comercio con Ir\u00e1n...Lo que firmamos es un Acuerdo General de Preferencia, donde cualquier pa\u00eds que es miembro puede decir \"yo me anoto \u201d.

Ir\u00e1n no tiene ning\u00fan embargo contra Argentina...\u201d (Levinas, Gabriel, op. cit. p\u00e1gs. 247/248, 269, 282; \u201cJoint press conference with FM Lieberman and Argentine FM Timerman\u201d, Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 04/04/2011).\nLuego de firmado el pacto, como surge de lo detallado p\u00e1rrafos m\u00e1s arriba, el Canciller no tuvo reparos en afirmar exactamente lo contrario de lo que ven\u00eda diciendo.\nOtro ejemplo de este tipo de afirmaciones falaces por parte del Sr. Canciller tuvo lugar en ocasi\u00f3n del tratamiento parlamentario del acuerdo cuando, para justificar el pacto -y la \u201cComisi\u00f3n de la Verdad\u201d prevista en el mismo-, hizo afirmaciones completamente inexactas sobre las vicisitudes del tr\u00e1mite de extradici\u00f3n del ex embajador iran\u00ed en Argentina para la \u00e9poca del atentado, Hadi Soleimanpour, ante las autoridades del Reino Unido.\nEn efecto, ante el plenario de comisiones en el Senado de la Naci\u00f3n, el 13 de febrero de 2013, el Ministro Timerman declar\u00f3: \u201c...el pedido de extradici\u00f3n ordenado por la Argentina del ex embajador iran\u00ed Hadi Soleimanpour fue desechado por la justicia brit\u00e1nica debido a la inexistencia de pruebas...que Interpol se neg\u00f3 a emitir una circular roja por considerar que ya hab\u00eda sido detenido y sobrese\u00eddo y liberado por falta de pruebas...que las pruebas producidas por el entonces juez de la causa el doctor Galeano para solicitar la extradici\u00f3n del ex embajador iran\u00ed al momento del atentado fueron desechadas porque seg\u00fan las autoridades judiciales de un tercer pa\u00eds, en este caso el Reino Unido, no alcanzaban ni para iniciar el proceso de extradici\u00f3n...'\u2019'\u2019 (Versi\u00f3n taquigr\u00e1fica del Plenario de las Comisiones de Relaciones Exteriores, Asuntos Constitucionales y de Justicia y Asuntos Penales de la C\u00e1mara de Senadores desarrollado el 13 de febrero de 2013).\nEn suma, Timerman afirm\u00f3 que la \u201cfalta de pruebas\u201d, que la \u201cinexistencia de pruebas\u2019\u2019\u2019\u2019 hab\u00eda llevado a las \u201cautoridades judiciales de un tercer pa\u00eds\u201d, en concreto, a la \u201cjusticia brit\u00e1nica\u2019\u2019\u2019 a sobreseer y liberar al diplom\u00e1tico persa, y que eso -adem\u00e1s- hab\u00eda derivado en que Interpol se niegue a emitir una nueva notificaci\u00f3n roja respecto de este sujeto cuando, vuelto a ser imputado por el Dr. Rodolfo Canicoba Corral, se libr\u00f3 renovada orden de captura internacional en su contra.\nPero, una vez m\u00e1s, los hechos estaban alejados de las palabras. En el a\u00f1o 2003, cuando la causa a\u00fan tramitaba ante el ex Juez Juan Jos\u00e9 Galeano, Soleimanpour fue detenido provisoriamente en el Reino Unido, con miras a su extradici\u00f3n, en virtud de una orden de captura que entonces se encontraba vigente. El diplom\u00e1tico iran\u00ed solicit\u00f3, y as\u00ed se le otorg\u00f3, libertad bajo fianza, para esperar fuera de prisi\u00f3n el tr\u00e1mite de extradici\u00f3n. En esa oportunidad, el juez brit\u00e1nico hizo algunas apreciaciones sobre la cuesti\u00f3n probatoria, pero aclar\u00f3 que era prematuro pronunciarse sobre el tema, porque la justicia argentina ten\u00eda dos meses para solicitar\nformalmente la extradici\u00f3n y presentar las evidencias del caso. En otras palabras, se estaba transitando la etapa de arresto provisorio y todav\u00eda no se hab\u00eda iniciado propiamente el juicio de extradici\u00f3n.\nY\taunque la justicia argentina cumpli\u00f3 con su parte, llegado el momento, fue el Subsecretario de Estado del Reino Unido quien decidi\u00f3 no dar curso al juicio de extradici\u00f3n de Soleimanpour, que no se pudo sustanciar, por razones de \u00edndole pol\u00edtico no expresadas en la decisi\u00f3n y en virtud de una prerrogativa legal prevista en el tratado de extradici\u00f3n que rigi\u00f3 el caso.\nEn suma, si no se pudo lograr la extradici\u00f3n de Soleimanpour en aquel momento fue por decisi\u00f3n pol\u00edtica, y no judicial, y \u00e9sta no se motiv\u00f3 en la poca solidez probatoria de aquella acusaci\u00f3n, como aviesamente se quiso hacer creer a la opini\u00f3n p\u00fablica, sino que fueron razones pol\u00edticas no expresadas las que llevaron a esa decisi\u00f3n. Soleimanpour no fue nunca sobrese\u00eddo por la justicia inglesa, como se dijo.\nEsto fue tambi\u00e9n advertido por la C\u00e1mara Federal y expuesto en el fallo que declar\u00f3 inconstitucional al Memorando de Entendimiento con Ir\u00e1n, y a su ley aprobatoria (Voto del Dr. Eduardo G. Farah, CCCF, Sala I, CFP 3184/2013/CA1 \u201cAMIA s/Amparo Ley 16.986, 15/05/2014, Juzgado N\u00b06- Secretar\u00eda N\u00b011).\nTodas estas falacias argumentativas conforman la campa\u00f1a de enga\u00f1o, ingrediente importante del plan de impunidad.\nAs\u00ed, la mendacidad y el doble discurso han sido la regla en este asunto. Todos los involucrados mienten deliberadamente y, para colmo, en cuestiones que son f\u00e1cilmente comprobables. De all\u00ed se concluye que la gravedad de las acciones a ocultar - el encubrimiento en favor de extranjeros pr\u00f3fugos, del peor atentado terrorista de la historia argentina- eclipsa los medios para hacerlo. Dicho llanamente, es tan terrible lo que se debe ocultar que no se presta atenci\u00f3n a los medios empleados en ese objetivo. Un cambio de declaraci\u00f3n, una mentira, un enga\u00f1o premeditado no tienen ni punto de comparaci\u00f3n con la perspectiva de que se descubra el plan encubridor.\nb.\tl) Manipulaci\u00f3n de las v\u00edctimas v de los familiares de las v\u00edctimas del atentado.\nAdem\u00e1s de falsear la realidad, mintiendo sobre el verdadero estado procesal de la causa AMIA, sobre el inicio de la negociaci\u00f3n con Ir\u00e1n, sobre el contenido de las posteriores reuniones que fueron p\u00fablicas y sobre el real sentido y alcance del Memorando de Entendimiento firmado; los autores de este encubrimiento no trepidaron en manipular vilmente tanto a las instituciones jud\u00edas afectadas por el atentado como a los sobrevivientes y a los familiares de las v\u00edctimas que perecieron en la explosi\u00f3n. El objetivo de esta deleznable actitud era el mismo de siempre: ganar el apoyo de estos actores en particular y de la sociedad en general para implementar, sin que nadie sepa, el plan de impunidad.\nEn efecto, apenas se tom\u00f3 conocimiento de la suscripci\u00f3n del memorando con Ir\u00e1n, tanto las instituciones jud\u00edas como las agrupaciones de v\u00edctimas y familiares de v\u00edctimas del atentado coincidieron en se\u00f1alar que no hab\u00edan sido previamente informados ni mucho menos consultados de que -efectivamente- se firmar\u00eda un acuerdo con Ir\u00e1n y, menos a\u00fan, de los contenidos del mismo (\u201cEl acuerdo con Ir\u00e1n sorprendi\u00f3 a los familiares de v\u00edctimas del ataque a la AMIA\u201d, Infobae, 27/01/2013).\nEn ese sentido, las autoridades de la AMIA hablaron de un \u201cmemorando inconsulto\u201d y se\u00f1alaron que: \u201cla propuesta aparece firmada, un hecho del que no hemos sido informados\u201d. Dijeron: \u201ceste memorando nos sorprende a toda la ciudadan\u00eda el pasado 27 de enero, jam\u00e1s fue consultado, ni siquiera comentado\u201d (Borger, Guillermo en: \u201cLa AMIA advirti\u00f3 un momento dif\u00edcil, tras el acuerdo entre Argentina e Ir\u00e1n\u201d, La Naci\u00f3n, 3/2/2013; \u201cPresidente de la AMIA prometi\u00f3 no bajar los brazos y se comprometi\u00f3 a evitar que la causa por el atentado causa en la nulidad\u201d, Agencia Jud\u00eda de Noticias, 4/3/2013).\nPor su parte, los representantes de la DAIA afirmaron haber tomado conocimiento del acuerdo en el mismo momento que el resto de la opini\u00f3n p\u00fablica y aclararon que la instituci\u00f3n no fue consultada previamente ni particip\u00f3 en la redacci\u00f3n del documento (Schlosser, Julio en: \u201cLA DAIA reconoci\u00f3 que hay un resquemor en la comunidad jud\u00eda por el acuerdo que la Argentina firm\u00f3 con Ir\u00e1n\u201d, Itongadol, 4/2/2013).\nDe hecho, la novedad les lleg\u00f3 por la cuenta oficial de \u201ctwitter\u201d de la Sra. Presidente e, inmediatamente, por los medios de comunicaci\u00f3n masiva (Mensajes de twitter de la cuenta de Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez del 27 de enero de 2013 de horas 10:26 a 10:32, transcriptos en p\u00e1rrafos previos; \u201cV\u00eda Twitter: La Presidenta sorprendi\u00f3 al anunciar un acuerdo con Ir\u00e1n por la AMIA\u201d, El Cronista Comercial, 28/01/2013).\nEllo gener\u00f3 un inmediato resquemor, dado que la Sra. Presidente se hab\u00eda comprometido p\u00fablicamente, en su discurso de septiembre de 2012 en Naciones Unidas, a consultar previamente cualquier propuesta formulada por Ir\u00e1n. Recu\u00e9rdense sus palabras: \u201ctengan la certeza de que esta Presidenta no va a tomar ninguna resoluci\u00f3n respecto de ninguna propuesta que le sea formulada, sin consultar PREVIAMENTE con quienes han sido las v\u00edctimas directas de esto.

Esta promesa nunca fue cumplida y, en rigor de verdad, se trat\u00f3 de una manipulaci\u00f3n de tantas que protagoniz\u00f3 la Sra. Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez en su recorrido delictual.\nAsimismo qued\u00f3 al descubierto la brutal diferencia con el modo en que en el pasado se hab\u00eda manejado esta cuesti\u00f3n con la dirigencia comunitaria y -principalmente- con los familiares y v\u00edctimas del atentado. Al respecto, Rafael Bielsa se\u00f1al\u00f3: \u201cEst\u00e1bamos en permanente contacto con los familiares y la comunidad, inform\u00e1ndolos de todo....Cada paso que d\u00e1bamos, cada memor\u00e1ndum que envi\u00e1bamos, lo consult\u00e1bamos con todos, porque era una cuesti\u00f3n muy sensible y estaba siempre el fantasma de las ofertas...'\u2019'\u2019 (Dobry, Hern\u00e1n, \u201cCancilleres K: el acuerdo con Ir\u00e1n ya hab\u00eda sido rechazado\u201d, Perfil, 23/02/2013).\nEn ese contexto, qued\u00f3 evidenciado que aquella incumplida promesa presidencial hab\u00eda tenido por objeto preservar el apoyo que, hasta entonces, ten\u00eda en gran medida la gesti\u00f3n de la Dra. Fern\u00e1ndez en relaci\u00f3n al caso AMIA, dentro de las entidades comunitarias y los grupos de familiares y v\u00edctimas del atentado.\nEn la misma l\u00ednea debe anotarse el tratamiento parlamentario por el que se aprob\u00f3 el memorando. El citado tr\u00e1mite parlamentario nada tiene de \u201cprevio a toda resoluci\u00f3n\u201d, ni de \u201cconsulta sobre una propuesta\u201d, sino que es el medio posterior para convalidar legislativamente una propuesta ya aceptada y firmada. Por otra parte, la aprobaci\u00f3n del memorando tuvo lugar en el \u00e1mbito del Poder Legislativo, que no constituye el espacio de actuaci\u00f3n, vinculaci\u00f3n y/o consulta del Poder Ejecutivo con los familiares de las v\u00edctimas, aun cuando algunos de ellos hayan podido concurrir a las sesiones y/o hayan hablado en instancia de comisi\u00f3n.\nAdem\u00e1s de todas estas obviedades que ratifican el incumplimiento de la promesa, no se le dio ninguna entidad a las opiniones adversas al acuerdo, cuando representantes de fuerzas pol\u00edticas opositoras, las instituciones comunitarias y varios de los grupos que engloban a familiares y v\u00edctimas se pronunciaron en contra de la aprobaci\u00f3n del acuerdo, expresando numerosas objeciones.\nPara sostener esta afirmaci\u00f3n, basta recurrir a los dichos de varios de los familiares de las v\u00edctimas del atentado. Sof\u00eda Guterman declar\u00f3: \u201cNadie nos inform\u00f3 para decirnos que ten\u00edamos que anotarnos. Nadie nos dijo nada. Me sorprendi\u00f3 mucho...No pens\u00e9 que iban a apurar tanto el tr\u00e1mite, pero evidentemente la carrera se terminaba y ten\u00edan que llegar a la meta propuesta...Me repugn\u00f3 cuando Pichetto dijo 'apuremos que la presidenta dijo que se termine(Sof\u00eda Guterman, \u201cSe est\u00e1 haciendo todo lo posible para que Ir\u00e1n salga triunfante de esto\u201d, Radio JAI, 14/02/2013).\nPor su parte, Laura Ginsberg afirm\u00f3: \u201c...Uno esperar\u00eda que el Congreso fuera un \u00e1mbito de reflexi\u00f3n, Timerman imprimi\u00f3, como tambi\u00e9n\n\n6\tEn alusi\u00f3n a Femando Esteche.\n7\tEn alusi\u00f3n al Ministro Julio De Vido.\n\n\nMinisterio P\u00fablico de la Naci\u00f3n\nlo senadores del oficialismo, las caracter\u00edsticas de un ambiente pobre, chicanero y vulgar...\u201d y en alusi\u00f3n al debate, se\u00f1al\u00f3: \u201c...estuvo en manos de Timerman y del gobierno, porque la intenci\u00f3n de ellos era apurar rapidito la ley...\u201d.

No tuvieron ning\u00fan tipo de participaci\u00f3n durante todo el proceso de negociaci\u00f3n que, como ya se comprob\u00f3, fue secreto.\nEn palabras de la dirigencia comunitaria jud\u00eda: \u201c...No hemos recibido ni siquiera una llamada telef\u00f3nica anticipando esta posibilidad. Nos hemos sorprendido, pleno domingo, D\u00eda Internacional del Holocausto, plenas vacaciones, plena feria judicial. Nos enteramos por los medios...

Versi\u00f3n taquigr\u00e1fica del plenario de comisiones del 13 de febrero de 2013).\nQueda claro que dijeran lo que dijeran los familiares y v\u00edctimas del atentado, la decisi\u00f3n estaba tomada. El memorando hab\u00eda sido firmado sin consulta previa y deb\u00eda ser aprobado a cualquier costo. Ello era estrictamente necesario para la consecuci\u00f3n del plan criminal perge\u00f1ado.\nA ello debe agregarse que la mentira presidencial sobre las consultas previas fue acompa\u00f1ada por una rotunda denegaci\u00f3n de informaci\u00f3n a los familiares de las v\u00edctimas del atentado, pese a que la\nenviada, como anexo, formando parte integrante del Memor\u00e1ndum de Entendimiento que se someter\u00e1 a la aprobaci\u00f3n...\u201d parlamentaria (\u201cAMIA informa a la opini\u00f3n p\u00fablica sobre las conclusiones de la reuni\u00f3n mantenida con el canciller Timerman en el d\u00eda de ayer\u201d, Prensa Jud\u00eda, 30/01/2013; \u201cLa AMIA pide que las promesas de Timerman sean anexadas por escrito al acuerdo original\u201d, Clar\u00edn, 30 de enero de 2013).\nPor su parte, la agrupaci\u00f3n \u201cMemoria Activa\u201d tambi\u00e9n emiti\u00f3 un comunicado que rezaba: \u201c...Memoria Activa concurri\u00f3 el martes 29/1 a una reuni\u00f3n convocada por el canciller H\u00e9ctor Timerman en la sede de la AMIA.

En declaraciones a la prensa, Adriana Reisfeld de \u201cMemoria Activa\u201d, agreg\u00f3: \u201cSe habl\u00f3 de estoy Timerman dijo que as\u00ed iba a ser.

Todo con un \u00fanico y delictivo prop\u00f3sito: lograr la impunidad definitiva de los acusados y el cese de toda actividad jurisdiccional en su contra, para viabilizar el objetivo mediato: comerciar libremente a nivel estatal y asociarse geopol\u00edticamente con la Rep\u00fablica Isl\u00e1mica de Ir\u00e1n sin soportar reproche alguno por parte de la sociedad argentina.\nResumiendo, para llevar a buen puerto el acuerdo con Ir\u00e1n y lograr la impunidad de los acusados, se tuvo que incumplir la promesa de una consulta previa a cualquier acuerdo y el compromiso asumido para negociar un anexo al convenio. Se hizo creer que se buscar\u00eda el consenso de todo el arco pol\u00edtico para avanzar en un pacto, pero -en los hechos- se desoyeron las m\u00faltiples y extendidas opiniones contrarias al memorando. Y como se ver\u00e1 en el ac\u00e1pite siguiente, se articularon puestas en escena para mostrar falsos avances diplom\u00e1ticos ante la sociedad argentina.\nb.\t2) Puestas en escena.\nLuego del discurso presidencial con motivo de la apertura del per\u00edodo de sesiones de la 68\u00b0Asamblea General de Naciones Unidas, la Dra. Fern\u00e1ndez reclam\u00f3 fuertemente a las autoridades iran\u00edes que respondan a las solicitudes argentinas en relaci\u00f3n al pacto firmado varios meses atr\u00e1s, (cfr. Discurso de Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez, 68\u00b0 Asamblea General de Naciones Unidas, 24 de septiembre de 2013). Ning\u00fan representante iran\u00ed estuvo presente en la sala para escuchar a la Dra. Fern\u00e1ndez y, a diferencia de ella, el Presidente Hassan Rohani ni mencion\u00f3 el tema en su discurso. Claros indicios, a esa altura de los acontecimientos, del exiguo inter\u00e9s de Teher\u00e1n en el acuerdo firmado con nuestro pa\u00eds, una vez cerrada la posibilidad del cese de las notificaciones rojas.\nPor lo pronto los reclamos mencionados en el par\u00e1grafo que antecede fueron realizados la noche del d\u00eda martes 24 de septiembre de 2013.

De su discurso se desprend\u00eda que Ir\u00e1n deb\u00eda confirmar si el acuerdo estaba aprobado, cu\u00e1ndo se conformar\u00eda la \u201cComisi\u00f3n de la Verdad\u201d prevista en su letra y cu\u00e1ndo viajar\u00edan las autoridades judiciales argentinas a las audiencias de Teher\u00e1n.\nMientras tanto, una diplomacia paralela conformada por canales de negociaci\u00f3n y comunicaci\u00f3n alternativos entre ambos gobiernos, actuaba para que la realidad se acomode a los intereses de los encubridores.

El mensaje no fue transmitido por el Palacio San Mart\u00edn a la canciller\u00eda iran\u00ed. No se comunic\u00f3 H\u00e9ctor Timerman con Mohammad Javad Zarif Khonsari. No pod\u00eda hacerse de esa manera. Sino que el mensaje sali\u00f3 del despacho presidencial de la Dra.

Completamente inaudito. Propio del plan criminal llevado adelante.\nEn efecto, Jorge \u201cYussuf\u2019 Khalil llam\u00f3 a la Embajada de Ir\u00e1n y avis\u00f3 que necesitaba ver al Encargado de Negocios en forma urgente: \u201c...yo necesito sacarlo quince minutos, necesito darle un mensaje...es urgente, urgente...es del gobierno argentino, mandaron un mensaje para \u00e9l ...llamaron reci\u00e9n de Casa de Gobierno...'''\u2019 (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 27/9/13, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-09-27-104209-26, CD 161).\nAdem\u00e1s, Luis D'El\u00eda urgi\u00f3 la presencia de Khalil dado que, adem\u00e1s, quer\u00eda que diera \u201caviso a otro lado\u201d, as\u00ed, agregar\u00eda: \u201cnecesito que hables con el sheik all\u00e1\u201d, en referencia a Mohsen Rabbani, aclarando en otro llamado: \u201c...mir\u00e1 que es muy groso lo que tengo, eh!...me lo pidi\u00f3...\u201d (Comunicaciones del 27/9/13, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009- 2013-09-27-114113-28, CD 161; Archivo B-1009-2013-09-27-104245- 8.txt, CD 161).

Primero y una vez m\u00e1s, el inter\u00e9s imperioso de los encubridores en avanzar con el plan. El tema no figuraba en la agenda de Ir\u00e1n en Nueva York: \u201c...la reuni\u00f3n se hace de apuro a pedido de Cristina...\u201d y \u201c ...f\u00edjate que Rohani ni habl\u00f3 del tema AMIA en su discurso...\u201d (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 27/09/2013, abonado 11-3238-4966, Archivo B-1009-2013-09-27-115448-6, CD 161).\n\n\nMinisterio P\u00fablico de la Naci\u00f3n\nAlgunos de los contactos que participaron de estas tratativas entendieron, un d\u00eda antes de la cumbre de cancilleres y sin conocer a\u00fan la respuesta de Teher\u00e1n, que las autoridades iran\u00edes no iban a conceder lo que secretamente solicitaba la Presidente Fern\u00e1ndez y, adem\u00e1s, que la actitud p\u00fablica de Argentina de \u201capurar\u201d a los iran\u00edes era pour la galerie o \u201cpara la galer\u00eda\u201d (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 27/09/2013, abonado 11-3238-4966, Archivo B-1009- 2013-09-27-115448-6, CD 161).\nSegundo, qued\u00f3 en exposici\u00f3n que hay cosas que se conversan y arreglan de antemano sin comunicar a la opini\u00f3n p\u00fablica, a la que se busca enga\u00f1ar con puesta en escenas, falsas negociaciones, acuerdos ocultos, etc. Se entiende que se maneje con reserva un tema delicado. Pero la reserva, en este caso, es \u00fanicamente para enga\u00f1ar y para ocultar actividades il\u00edcitas. Es para aparentar y no ser descubiertos.\nTercero, estas pruebas ponen en evidencia que, por detr\u00e1s, sin que nadie lo sepa, estaba todo arreglado y, en realidad, no exist\u00eda ning\u00fan secreto ni expectativa, porque las autoridades argentinas sab\u00edan lo que ocurrir\u00eda en la cumbre. \u201cPour la galerie\u201d se har\u00eda aquello que terminaron acordando con Teher\u00e1n previamente, aunque no fuera exactamente lo que se hab\u00eda pedido desde el despacho presidencial de la Casa Rosada, como surge de las comunicaciones aqu\u00ed transcriptas. A trav\u00e9s del canal paralelo por el que tambi\u00e9n se ejecut\u00f3 este encubrimiento, Luis D'El\u00eda llam\u00f3 a su amigo Jorge \u201cYussuf\u2019 Khalil, referente org\u00e1nico de Ir\u00e1n en el pa\u00eds, para transmitirle un mensaje que deb\u00eda llevar a Teher\u00e1n, sobre lo que la Presidente necesitaba que los iran\u00edes anuncien en el encuentro, para enga\u00f1ar a la ciudadan\u00eda respecto del estado de situaci\u00f3n real.\nLa reuni\u00f3n del s\u00e1bado 28 de septiembre de 2013, entre Timerman y el flamante Canciller iran\u00ed Mohammad Javad Zarif Khonsari, en la sede de Naciones Unidas en Nueva York, fue una mise en scene, es decir, una puesta en escena para que la gente crea verdaderamente que estaban negociando algo y/o que la diplomacia argentina estaba obteniendo resultados en funci\u00f3n de la reciente demanda p\u00fablica de la mandataria.\nComo ya se indic\u00f3, lo cierto es que las autoridades argentinas hab\u00edan pedido -por canales no oficiales- un anuncio conjunto de ambos cancilleres y definiciones sobre varios temas, algo, aparentemente, demasiado ambicioso. Pero los iran\u00edes, en lo que pudo ser \u201c...un gesto...hacia el gobierno argentino en v\u00edsperas de elecciones...\u201d (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 27/09/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009- 2013-09-27-135214-22, CD 161), aceptaron meramente que se anuncie p\u00fablica, aunque no conjuntamente, que Ir\u00e1n hab\u00eda aprobado el memorando con el aval del Consejo Superior de Seguridad Nacional y del L\u00edder Supremo, aunque esto no fuera cierto. Nuevamente \u201cpour la galerie\u201d.\nAquel s\u00e1bado 28 los cancilleres tuvieron dos reuniones, con consultas intermedias a sus mandatarios. No se intercambiaron las notas reversales. El tratado no entr\u00f3 en vigor. No se defini\u00f3 ning\u00fan plazo respecto de la \u201cComisi\u00f3n de la Verdad\u201d ni sobre las audiencias de Teher\u00e1n. No hubo ning\u00fan anuncio conjunto. Ninguna autoridad iran\u00ed declar\u00f3 nada oficialmente.\nLuego de las reuniones, el Canciller Timerman dialog\u00f3 con la prensa y explic\u00f3 que su par le hab\u00eda asegurado que el memorando estaba aprobado internamente por el Consejo Nacional de Defensa, con el Presidente de Ir\u00e1n a la cabeza y el aval del L\u00edder Supremo. Y que equipos t\u00e9cnicos se reunir\u00edan en Suiza en la primera quincena de noviembre para ir viendo la implementaci\u00f3n del acuerdo (Miri, Ignacio, \u201cTimerman dijo que Ir\u00e1n aprob\u00f3 el pacto por la AMIA, pero a\u00fan no rige\u201d, Clar\u00edn, 29/09/2013; Pisani, Silvia, \u201cIr\u00e1n le confirm\u00f3 a Timerman que ya aprob\u00f3 el acuerdo\u201d, La Naci\u00f3n, 29/09/2013 \u201cTimerman anunci\u00f3 nueva reuni\u00f3n con Ir\u00e1n en noviembre\u201d, Prensa Argentina, 28/09/2013; \u201cTimerman ratific\u00f3 la aprobaci\u00f3n del memor\u00e1ndum de entendimiento con Ir\u00e1n y un nuevo encuentro\u201d, T\u00e9lam, 28/09/2013; \u201cIr\u00e1n aprob\u00f3 el memor\u00e1ndum de entendimiento por la AMIA\u201d, P\u00e1gina 12, 28/09/2013).\nIRNA, la agencia oficial de noticias de la Rep\u00fablica Isl\u00e1mica inform\u00f3 sobre el encuentro de ambos cancilleres, pero nada dijo sobre la aprobaci\u00f3n del memor\u00e1ndum, sino que se limit\u00f3 a comunicar que se hab\u00eda\n16\tAs\u00ed denominan al Encargado de Negocios apostado en Buenos Aires, por ser -actualmente- la persona de mayor jerarqu\u00eda dentro de la Embajada.\n\n\n\n\nconvenido una nueva reuni\u00f3n para noviembre en Ginebra, Suiza. (IRNA, \u201cZarif contin\u00faes talks with counterparts in New York\u201d, 29/09/2013). Es decir, Ir\u00e1n acept\u00f3 reunirse y no desmentir las declaraciones de Timerman pero no fue m\u00e1s all\u00e1.\nDe hecho, en Ir\u00e1n, la pretendida aprobaci\u00f3n del acuerdo fue meramente informada por el \u201cTehran Times\u201d que tom\u00f3 como \u00fanica fuente de esta novedad a la agencia de noticias oficial argentina T\u00c9LAM. In\u00e9dito. El diario persa \u201cTehran Times\u201d, uno de los m\u00e1s importantes de la naci\u00f3n iran\u00ed, en su tarea de informar sobre una decisi\u00f3n adoptada por el gobierno de su pa\u00eds refiri\u00f3 como fuente a la agencia oficial de noticias de otro pa\u00eds, Argentina (\u201cArgentina says Ir\u00e1n committed to probing 1994 bombing\u201d, Tehran Times, 29/09/2013; \u201cTimerman ratific\u00f3 la aprobaci\u00f3n del memor\u00e1ndum de entendimiento con Ir\u00e1n y un nuevo encuentro\u201d, T\u00e9lam, 28/09/2013) \u00bfC\u00f3mo puede ser que la fuente no sea iran\u00ed? \u00bfC\u00f3mo puede ser que para un acto de gobierno decidido y producido en Teher\u00e1n la fuente del \u201cTehran Times\u201d sea T\u00c9LAM?\nEn este episodio, como en otros, la actuaci\u00f3n del canciller hab\u00eda sido maquillaje medi\u00e1tico, pues todo se sab\u00eda de antes. Todo se prepar\u00f3, se negoci\u00f3 y tergivers\u00f3 antes. En secreto. Por los canales paralelos y paraoficiales que, como se demostrar\u00e1 a continuaci\u00f3n, han sido muy importantes en la consecuci\u00f3n del encubrimiento aqu\u00ed denunciado. Mientras la Rep\u00fablica Argentina estaba pendiente del resultado de la reuni\u00f3n del Canciller en Nueva York, en la Casa Rosada ya sab\u00edan qu\u00e9 ocurrir\u00eda y que todo era una puesta en escena. Ello no importaba, lo relevante fue lo que se transmiti\u00f3 luego a la opini\u00f3n p\u00fablica y, obviamente, el enga\u00f1o.\nAhora bien, todos los elementos descriptos en este ac\u00e1pite deben ser interpretados de forma integral y en funci\u00f3n de una cuesti\u00f3n central: los encubridores necesitaron contar siempre con el mayor apoyo posible por parte de la opini\u00f3n p\u00fablica para facilitar la implementaci\u00f3n de su plan criminal. Dadas las especiales caracter\u00edsticas del encubrimiento aqu\u00ed denunciado y el rol institucional de muchos de sus autores y part\u00edcipes, el peso de la opini\u00f3n p\u00fablica en el respaldo al Memorando de Entendimiento y la necesidad de que la misma permanezca ajena a los verdaderos objetivos perseguidos mediante el citado instrumento, han signado acciones y reacciones p\u00fablicas de los involucrados.\nEn suma, viene al caso enumerar las falsedades y dem\u00e1s maniobras ardidosas en que han incurrido la Sra. Presidente y su Canciller para ocultar su plan criminal: 1) la causa est\u00e1 paralizada, 2) no se permitir\u00e1 que el caso AMIA se transforme en una pieza de ajedrez de la geopol\u00edtica mundial, 3) con la aplicaci\u00f3n del Memorando de Entendimiento no hay nada que perder, 4) el acuerdo no contiene cl\u00e1usulas secretas, 5) el instrumento permite recibirle declaraci\u00f3n indagatoria a los imputados iran\u00edes, 6) no hay ning\u00fan inter\u00e9s comercial detr\u00e1s de este acuerdo, 7) no se puede comerciar con Ir\u00e1n porque est\u00e1 prohibido por la ONU, 8) se consultar\u00e1 a los familiares y v\u00edctimas previo a tomar cualquier decisi\u00f3n sobre las propuestas iran\u00edes, 9) se firmar\u00e1 un anexo al Memorando de Entendimiento que asegure la vigencia de las notificaciones rojas, 10) la negociaci\u00f3n con Ir\u00e1n se inici\u00f3 a instancias de Teher\u00e1n, 11) el proceso de negociaci\u00f3n comenz\u00f3 en septiembre de 2012.\nc)\tOtros caminos para favorecer el plan de impunidad\nLa campa\u00f1a para motorizar el encubrimiento no fue solamente medi\u00e1tica, se han obtenido evidencias que exponen las intenciones de los part\u00edcipes de este encubrimiento de remover al suscripto de su cargo al frente de la Unidad Fiscal que investiga el atentado contra la sede de la AMIA, como una forma m\u00e1s de allanar el camino para el cumplimiento de sus objetivos criminales.\nUna de las v\u00edas elegidas para este caso fue utilizar la falsa hip\u00f3tesis armada desde cierto sector de la Secretar\u00eda de Inteligencia para culpar por el atentado a nuevos autores inventados como el mecanismo para desacreditar la labor del suscripto. Es decir, si se lograba imponer esta falsa teor\u00eda como la verdadera, ello implicaba, por a\u00f1adidura, que la labor de la Unidad Fiscal hab\u00eda sido errada o peor a\u00fan, malintencionada. En consecuencia, podr\u00eda sostenerse con mayor facilidad un intento de remoci\u00f3n de quien firma esta presentaci\u00f3n.\nJustamente, las pruebas han revelado que: \u201c...va a venir otra hip\u00f3tesis con otras pruebas\u201d. Y en ese escenario, se dijo que el suscripto va a quedar totalmente descolocado por la nueva hip\u00f3tesis fundada en pruebas falsas que, obviamente, no estaban agregadas a la causa. Se dijo: \u201c...va a hacer culo al norte, porque nunca las vio, \u00e9l, las pruebas ...lo que viene ahora... es una prueba contundente...\u201d (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 01/06/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-06-01-224726-18, CD 43). Efectivamente, se sab\u00eda que para deslegitimar al abajo firmante y a la investigaci\u00f3n llevada a cabo conforme a derecho, para avanzar con el encubrimiento de los acusados iran\u00edes, necesitaban inventar una nueva -y falsa- hip\u00f3tesis, con \u201cpruebas\u201d nunca vistas, nunca presentadas en la causa.\nDe estas expresiones de \u201cAlian\u201d se desprende que para quienes se encuentran detr\u00e1s de este encubrimiento, un objetivo clave ha sido remover al suscripto, mediante el descr\u00e9dito personal y/o la deslegitimaci\u00f3n de la pesquisa, a partir de -como surge de sus planes- hip\u00f3tesis inventadas con pruebas falsas.\nExisten otros indicios que dan cuenta del inter\u00e9s de remover a este denunciante. Como se dijo, el descr\u00e9dito de la investigaci\u00f3n resulta un paso necesario para el plan, cuya ejecuci\u00f3n se ver\u00eda enormemente facilitada -sin lugar a dudas- por la ausencia de quien tiene a su cargo la investigaci\u00f3n de este acto de terrorismo internacional.\nKhalil sab\u00eda porque \u201cAlian\u201d, su contacto en la Secretar\u00eda de Inteligencia, con acceso al entorno presidencial, le hab\u00eda dicho que planeaban crear \u201cotra hip\u00f3tesis con otras pruebas'\u2019\u2019\u2019 y as\u00ed, descolocar\u00edan al abajo firmante (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 01/06/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-06-01-224726-18, CD 43). Entonces, con motivo de la pronunciamiento emitido desde la Unidad Fiscal \u201cAMIA\u201d el 29 de mayo de 2013 que, justamente, profundiza la prueba y brinda nuevos elementos sobre la participaci\u00f3n de funcionarios iran\u00edes en el atentado, Khalil asever\u00f3: \u201c...son los \u00faltimos manotazos de ahogado que puede tirar este chab\u00f3n...\u2019\u2019\u2019' (Conversaci\u00f3n del 1/06/2013, abonado 11-3964-0799, Archivo 61.30373.20130601.225511, CD 86).\nEl 16 de julio de 2013, a dos d\u00edas del aniversario del atentado, quien suscribe expuso en la sede del Hotel Intercontinental de la Ciudad Aut\u00f3noma de Buenos Aires, ante un amplio auditorio que incluy\u00f3 legisladores nacionales y porte\u00f1os, periodistas y expertos en derecho internacional, en el marco de una jornada organizada por el Congreso Jud\u00edo Latinoamericano . En referencia a esa exposici\u00f3n Jorge Khalil, quien conversaba con Alejandro Jos\u00e9 Salom\u00f3n, dijo: \u201c...estoy escuchando a Nisman... \u00a1c\u00f3mo nos mat\u00f3 un poquito!...si, si, nos mat\u00f3 bien, eh...para variar, si, si, para variar nos mat\u00f3 bien...\u201d, y Salom\u00f3n le respondi\u00f3: \u201c...bueno, cada vez es menos cre\u00edble y marcha la intervenci\u00f3n de ese muchacho...\u201d (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 17/07/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-07-17-134828-28, CD 89). Estas palabras se corresponden con ciertos trascendidos de aquellas fechas que refer\u00edan la posibilidad de intervenci\u00f3n de esta Unidad Fiscal (\u201cEstudian intervenir la fiscal\u00eda del caso AMIA\u201d, Perfil, 14/07/2013).\nClaramente subyace el objetivo de alejar al suscripto del cargo que viene ejerciendo y, consecuentemente, de la causa AMIA, lo que se condice con las expresiones referidas en el p\u00e1rrafo previo. Ello beneficiar\u00eda sin duda al plan encubridor que aqu\u00ed se detalla y se denuncia.\nDe los hechos enumerados en este apartado queda evidenciado que se lanz\u00f3 una feroz campa\u00f1a de descr\u00e9dito hacia la investigaci\u00f3n del caso, destinada a horadar la versi\u00f3n judicial de los hechos, y se la combin\u00f3 con una campa\u00f1a de enga\u00f1o compuesta por falacias, puestas en escena, mentiras, desmentidas y falsas promesas, se manipul\u00f3 a v\u00edctimas y familiares del atentado, su busc\u00f3 separar al suscripto de su cargo al frente de la Unidad Fiscal que investiga el atentado, a fin de evitar que la opini\u00f3n\n\n\nALBERTO\nMinisterio P\u00fablico de la Naci\u00f3n\tF|SCAL GEN\u00a3RAL\np\u00fablica conozca la entidad del verdadero objetivo encubridor que subyace al pacto con Ir\u00e1n.\nd)\tGestos y otros favores: ingredientes para facilitar el plan de impunidad.\nLos autores de este encubrimiento siempre tuvieron claro que una parte importante del mismo consist\u00eda en contar con la buena predisposici\u00f3n de las autoridades del r\u00e9gimen iran\u00ed y de sus referentes locales, dado que la aquiescencia, o mejor a\u00fan, el respaldo de estos actores, contribuir\u00eda a facilitar el avance del plan criminal, por las peculiares caracter\u00edsticas del mismo.\nNaturalmente, la cuesti\u00f3n relativa al cese de las notificaciones rojas, como ya se demostr\u00f3, era un inter\u00e9s crucial para Teher\u00e1n y gener\u00f3 fricciones entre encubridores y encubiertos. Por otra parte, el establecimiento de canales de comunicaci\u00f3n y negociaci\u00f3n paralelos a los oficiales, tambi\u00e9n result\u00f3 un recurso central para favorecer el acercamiento y el buen entendimiento con Teher\u00e1n, en pos del avance del plan delictivo.\nNo obstante ello, las acciones destinadas a conseguir la buena predisposici\u00f3n de los iran\u00edes, y as\u00ed facilitar el tr\u00e1nsito del plan criminal, no estuvieron limitadas a estos dos puntos, sino que se ha podido constatar la concesi\u00f3n de una serie de favores concretos, como por ejemplo: facilitaci\u00f3n de gestiones, promesas de puestos de trabajo y acceso a contactos importantes; todos ellos procurados a los referentes locales del r\u00e9gimen, como gestos de buena voluntad y cercan\u00eda, destinados a favorecer -en \u00faltima instancia- el plan de impunidad.\nEstos \u201cfavores\u201d fundamentalmente demuestran el inter\u00e9s de la Sra. Presidente en mantener en buenos t\u00e9rminos su relaci\u00f3n con los contactos iran\u00edes, para poder avanzar con su plan delictivo. Y en esa l\u00ednea deben ser interpretados.\nEl 28 de mayo de 2013, Adalberto Assad tuvo una reuni\u00f3n en el Ministerio de Justicia, que inmediatamente report\u00f3 a su referente Jorge \u201cYussuf\u201d Khalil: \u201c...reci\u00e9n sal\u00ed hace un rato del Ministerio de\nJusticia...tengo unas novedades lindas ...necesito verte...necesito tener una charlaen el marco de una serie de visitas protocolares que distintos representantes que responden a Ir\u00e1n tuvieron en organismos oficiales, entre los que se encuentra el Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 28/5/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-05-28- 141635-26.txt, CD 39).\nEste acercamiento y la novedad de contar con \u201cpuertas abiertas\u201d en los despachos m\u00e1s importantes del pa\u00eds lleg\u00f3 inmediatamente a conocimiento del pr\u00f3fugo Mohsen Rabbani, quien -como ya fue probado- ha participado activamente de las negociaciones con sus encubridores.\nEn esa ocasi\u00f3n, Assad le report\u00f3 a Rabbani sobre su reuni\u00f3n con un ministro nacional: \u201c...muchas cosas lindas que estamos viendo...reunidos con el Ministro, me sorprendi\u00f3 hoy, porque una apertura muy importante hacia la colectividad...esto es pol\u00edtica, sheik...Estamos trabajando para...el gobierno, ahora estamos trabajando porque el Ministro va a hablar con la Presidente, me dijo hoy, para que me reciba...tengo ganas de verla a la Presidenta...\u201d. Rabbani entend\u00eda que: \u201c...nosotros...hab\u00edamos conversado con Argentina...Ir\u00e1n fue el primer comprador de Argentina y ahora no compra casi nada...pero...puede cambiar esta situaci\u00f3n con ustedes y con el gobierno\u201d, en alusi\u00f3n a los actuales referentes de Ir\u00e1n en Argentina, como Khalil, y las autoridades del presente gobierno argentino (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 28/5/13, abonado 11-3238- 4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-05-28-155549-2, CD 39).\nDe hecho, d\u00edas antes de esta reuni\u00f3n en la cartera de justicia, el imputado Rabbani hab\u00eda recibido el mensaje enviado por Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez, a trav\u00e9s del Ministro De Vido y de los intermediarios Luis D'El\u00eda y Jorge Khalil, que expresaba el inter\u00e9s por obtener petr\u00f3leo (Comunicaciones del 20/05/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009- 2013-05-20-111124-8, CD 31; Archivo B-1009-2013-05-20-114842-2, CD 31; Archivo B-1009-2013-05-20-122551-14, CD 31; Archivo B-1009- 2013-05-20-132253-6, CD 31; Archivo B-1009-2013-05-20-133130-8, CD 31; Archivo B-1009-2013-05-20-143508-24, CD 31).\n\n\nMinisterio P\u00fablico de la Naci\u00f3n\nMotorizado por la ciega necesidad de las autoridades argentinas involucradas en este plan de avanzar con la maniobra encubridora, los referentes locales del r\u00e9gimen iran\u00ed comenzaron a tener acceso a los despachos de distintos funcionarios de la gesti\u00f3n de Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez. A trav\u00e9s del agente identificado como \u201cAlian\u201d, cercano a la Sra. Presidente, los representantes de Teher\u00e1n en Argentina han podido acceder a favores y a un trato preferencial en las m\u00e1s variadas gestiones. De ese modo, han utilizado los resortes y se han valido de sus flamantes contactos con el poder pol\u00edtico local.\nPor ejemplo: \u201cAlian\u201d le prometi\u00f3 a Khalil cargos en la Direcci\u00f3n Nacional de Aduanas y en el Ministerio de Interior y Transporte para gente de la comunidad chiita, \u201c...tiene que haber cambios en transporte y aduana y ah\u00ed van a tratar de meter ...diez tipos en cada lado\u201d (Comunicaciones del 4/7/13, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009- 2013-07-04-112603-6.txt, CD 76 y del 7/7/13, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-07-07-152130-22, CD 79). Tambi\u00e9n Khalil le ha pedido favores para sus contactos en la Aduana (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 24/05/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-05-24-175330- 20.txt, CD 35).\nEn una oportunidad, Femando Esteche le aconsej\u00f3 a Khalil que para que el \u201cblanqueo\u201d con la comunidad iran\u00ed local tenga mayor visibilidad p\u00fablica, exija algunos gestos del gobierno, como por ejemplo \u201c...que los inviten o que los empiecen a invitar a los actos de la Casa Rosada como exponentes de la comunidad...\u201d o \u201c.. .que la Presidente un d\u00eda vaya para el Ramad\u00e1n, para un desayuno...\u201d, y agreg\u00f3: \u201c...que la Presidenta vaya...eso es m\u00e1s f\u00e1cil para \u201cAlian \u201d...\u201d (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 18/12/2012, abonado 11- 3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2012-12-18-183332-8, CD 226). Pretend\u00edan darle mayor publicidad al acercamiento.\nEn otra ocasi\u00f3n, ante inconvenientes impositivos con la AFIP, miembros de la comunidad recurrieron a Jorge Khalil quien, a trav\u00e9s de Luis D\u2019El\u00eda, garantiz\u00f3 el contacto directo con el Administrador Federal de Ingresos P\u00fablicos, Ricardo Echegaray, para resolver el problema\n(Comunicaci\u00f3n del 21/11/13, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009- 2013-11-21-210631-26, CD 216).\nY\tse obtuvo similar resultado, esto es, contactar a Ricardo Echegaray, a trav\u00e9s de la gesti\u00f3n de \u201cAlian\u201d quien, ante un pedido de Khalil le expres\u00f3: \u201c...no hay problema...te ven\u00eds conmigo...\u201d (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 13/06/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-l009-2013-06-13-213124- 24, CD 55).\nCabe se\u00f1alar que estos \u201cfavores\u201d encontraron, en m\u00e1s de una ocasi\u00f3n, el correlato buscado, es decir, se tradujeron en el avenimiento de los referentes locales del r\u00e9gimen, como Jorge Khalil, que en m\u00e1s de una ocasi\u00f3n expresaron su apoyo al gobierno argentino y actuaron de forma tal de fortalecer los v\u00ednculos entre Teher\u00e1n y Buenos Aires, contribuyendo al avance del plan encubridor. En esa l\u00ednea deben entenderse expresiones como: \u201c...tenemos que dar combate ac\u00e1, le digo, con la gente del gobierno, para apoyar al gobierno...'1'\u2019 (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 14/2/13, abonado 11-3315- 6908, Archivo B-l009-2013-02-14-164341-10, CD 284).\nY\ttambi\u00e9n en esa misma l\u00ednea debe interpretarse, por ejemplo, el episodio que tuvo lugar en noviembre de 2012, antes de firmarse el acuerdo, cuando Luis D\u2019El\u00eda y Andr\u00e9s Larroque le solicitaron a Jorge \u201cYussuf\u2019 Khalil que no se sume a una marcha organizada por partidos de izquierda en defensa de la \u201ccausa palestina\u201d porque ese tipo de acciones pod\u00edan repercutir en las nuevas relaciones bilaterales. Khalil accedi\u00f3 al pedido y explic\u00f3 los motivos de su allanamiento: \u201c...Me imagino que los troskos van a empezar con mensajes en contra del gobierno, cosa que yo no quiero...no queremos hacer algo que irrite...no queremos irritar al gobierno argentino...no voy a hacer nada para irritar al gobierno argentino ...estamos arreglando un problema mayor para nosotros... \u201d, en evidente alusi\u00f3n a las imputaciones de los iran\u00edes por el atentado contra la AMIA (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 16/11/2012, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B- 1009-2012-11-16-225815-2, CD 194).\nSobre el mismo tema, explic\u00f3: \u201c...Hoy a la ma\u00f1ana tuve una reuni\u00f3n con la gente del gobierno, me pidieron que por favor no vaya a la\nreuni\u00f3n...\u201d y le dijeron: \u201c ...par\u00e1 la bronca porque el tema de...puede repercutir en las relaciones que est\u00e1n manteniendo, las conversaciones que estamos teniendo nosotros en Ginebraen clara alusi\u00f3n a las rondas diplom\u00e1ticas que desembocar\u00edan en la firma del Memorando de Entendimiento (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 17/11/2012, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2012-11-17-183444-8, CD 195).\nFinalmente, sobre el mismo episodio, relat\u00f3 Khalil: \u201c...estamos en plenas negociaciones con el gobierno...en base a las negociaciones que se est\u00e1n haciendo entre Ir\u00e1n y Argentina, no queremos vernos inmiscuidos nosotros. Aparte fue un pedido del gobierno. Yo estuve hablando con D'El\u00eda y con el Cuervo Larroque y me pidieron eso y yo lo transmit\u00ed al Safir...y el Safir me dijo lo mismo... 'no hagamos algo que, que pueda molestar'....\u201d (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 18/11/2012, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2012-11-18-095153-16, CD 196).\nAhora bien, estos pedidos y favores por parte de los referentes locales de Teher\u00e1n hubieran sido impensados de no haber existido el ostensible giro pol\u00edtico y posterior acercamiento por parte de las autoridades argentinas, como ya fue probado en la presente.\nDe hecho, tambi\u00e9n se obtuvieron numerosas piezas probatorias que dan cuenta -justamente- de este nuevo posicionamiento pol\u00edtico del \u201cgobierno argentino\u201d. Nuevamente, vale aclarar que aqu\u00ed no se analizan ni valoran decisiones pol\u00edticas. El valor que se le reconoce a las manifestaciones que a continuaci\u00f3n se transcribir\u00e1n radica en que revelan, una vez m\u00e1s, que la realidad distaba bastante de lo que se comunicaba p\u00fablicamente. Mientras a los argentinos nos dec\u00edan que se hab\u00eda logrado doblegar, de cierta manera, la hist\u00f3rica renuencia iran\u00ed a colaborar con la causa judicial y que Teher\u00e1n se allanaba -de alg\u00fan modo- a los requerimientos argentinos; lo cierto es que el mensaje recibido en Teher\u00e1n era otro: la Dra. Fern\u00e1ndez hab\u00eda decidido garantizar la impunidad de los iran\u00edes acusados por el atentado terrorista, como proleg\u00f3meno al comercio por petr\u00f3leo persa. Y estaba dispuesta a congraciarse con el r\u00e9gimen.\nEse fue el mensaje recibido en Teher\u00e1n, y as\u00ed lo expresaron sus referentes: \u201c...porque el gobierno ahora est\u00e1 a favor...\u201d de Ir\u00e1n (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 6/6/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009- 2013-06-06-092046-14, CD 48); \u201c...el gobierno banca...'''1 (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 30/05/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-05-30- 225622-30,\tCD41);\t\u201c ...estamos bien. Salieron a defendernos,\ndirectamente...\u201d, se dijo en oportunidad del debate de aprobaci\u00f3n parlamentaria del acuerdo con Ir\u00e1n (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 14/2/13, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2013-02-14-164341 -10, CD 284).\nEl mismo d\u00eda en que se firm\u00f3 el acuerdo con Ir\u00e1n, Jorge Khalil celebraba \u201c...este acuerdo...esta nueva relaci\u00f3n...esta nueva etapa...\u201d, en clara referencia a este nuevo contexto de acercamiento con el gobierno argentino (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 27/01/13, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B- 1009-2013-01-27-112032-4, CD 266). Unos d\u00edas despu\u00e9s, Khalil destac\u00f3 nuevamente este sustancial cambio de postura: \u201c...fij\u00e1te con qui\u00e9n se est\u00e1 arreglando el gobierno \u201d, en alusi\u00f3n al acercamiento entre Ir\u00e1n y Argentina (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 3/2/2013, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009- 2013-02-03-141619-26, CD 273).\nEn julio de ese mismo a\u00f1o continuaban las expresiones de j\u00fabilo por la nueva postura en relaci\u00f3n a Ir\u00e1n. Khalil, el d\u00eda del \u00faltimo aniversario del atentado contra la AMIA dijo: \u201c ...nosotros estamos ...ante un acuerdo con el gobierno nacional ...atr\u00e1s de una negociaci\u00f3n con el gobierno nacional...\u201d, y de toda la conversaci\u00f3n surge a las claras que no se est\u00e1 refiriendo \u00fanicamente al memorando de entendimiento, sino a un arreglo subyacente y mucho m\u00e1s amplio (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 18/07/13,\nabonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-07-18-155916-12, CD 90).\n18 \u2022\nEn el acto del D\u00eda de Al Quds , Abdul Karim Paz dijo, en torno a la causa AMIA y en referencia al Memorando de Entendimiento firmado con Ir\u00e1n, que: \u201c...la Argentina ha entendido c\u00f3mo son las cosas, quiere dar vuelta la p\u00e1gina e independizarse de lo que dicen los Estados Unidos e\nIsrael...\u201d (Dinatale, Mart\u00edn, \u201cD'El\u00eda y Esteche reivindicaron a la agrupaci\u00f3n terrorista Hezbollah\u201d, La Naci\u00f3n, 13/08/2013).\nM\u00e1s recientemente, en febrero de 2014, Khalil le segu\u00eda informando a Rabbani: \u201c...estamos trabajando bien en lo pol\u00edtico ac\u00e1...\u201d (Comunciaci\u00f3n del 4/2/14, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2014- 02-04-093431-30, CD 291).\nLos referentes locales de la Rep\u00fablica Isl\u00e1mica hab\u00edan interpretado las acciones del \u201cgobierno argentino\u201d como favorables a la postura e intereses de Teher\u00e1n: el \u201cgobierno argentino\u201d ahora apoyaba sus intereses, esto es, la desincriminaci\u00f3n de los ciudadanos iran\u00edes en la causa judicial y consecuentemente, la desvinculaci\u00f3n de Ir\u00e1n y de la comunidad iran\u00ed local de la sospecha de su participaci\u00f3n en el atentado.\nIncluso los part\u00edcipes del encubrimiento dieron por sentado la desincriminaci\u00f3n de los iran\u00edes y el consecuente blanqueo de la comunidad, y comenzaron a planificar proyectos futuros. En ese sentido, \u201cAlian\u201d sostuvo: \u201c...hay un mont\u00f3n de temas que tenemos que ir arm\u00e1ndolo ...con inteligencia...estamos muy bien y hay que laburar tranquilos ....tenemos que hacer un trabajo de ac\u00e1 a 10 a\u00f1os...\u00bfme entend\u00e9s? Que en un a\u00f1o y medio tengamos las buenas noticias, pero ac\u00e1 hay que hacer un trabajo para mucho tiempo...\u201d (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 6/2/2013, abonado 11-3315- 6908, Archivo B-1009-2013-02-06-203822-26, CD 276). Tiempo despu\u00e9s, los agentes iran\u00edes continuaban operando con la misma idea: \u201c...Es un tema de largo plazo, para trabajarlo bien...Hay que instalar un poco cuatro, cinco \u201cverdades\u201d fuertes, hay que instalarlas...\u201d (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 3/10/2014, abonado 11-6224-0263, Archivo B-1009-2014-10-03-223900- 28).\nAdvi\u00e9rtase que \u201cAlian\u201d y Khalil ten\u00edan la seguridad que los iran\u00edes iban a quedar liberados de la imputaci\u00f3n de la justicia, \u201cque en un a\u00f1o y medio tengamos las buenas noticias\u201d es la expresi\u00f3n inequ\u00edvoca que refleja ese pensamiento. Ya hab\u00edan dado por removido ese obst\u00e1culo y se colocaban en otro horizonte, un escal\u00f3n m\u00e1s arriba, pensando estrat\u00e9gicamente de ac\u00e1 a varios a\u00f1os.\nEn definitiva, no fueron dos partes negociando un acuerdo, como se lo quiso presentar p\u00fablicamente, son dos socios buscando borrar del modo m\u00e1s cre\u00edble posible, una imputaci\u00f3n penal por un delito de lesa humanidad.\nVI.- Canales paralelos de comunicaci\u00f3n y negociaci\u00f3n\nEl plan criminal que aqu\u00ed se pone en evidencia y se denuncia de ninguna forma debe ser confundido con una negociaci\u00f3n diplom\u00e1tica, aunque su ejecuci\u00f3n haya incluido contactos diplom\u00e1ticos formales. Lo cierto es que la calidad delictiva del plan tambi\u00e9n se evidencia en la necesidad de contar con esos canales paralelos, no oficiales, como v\u00edas concretas, eficientes y confiables para avanzar con el prop\u00f3sito que verdaderamente ha tenido el acercamiento y las negociaciones diplom\u00e1ticas formales: la impunidad de los acusados iran\u00edes por el caso AMIA.\nComo se mencion\u00f3 previamente, existen m\u00faltiples elementos probatorios que corroboran la existencia de canales de comunicaci\u00f3n y negociaci\u00f3n paralelos al oficial, aunque interconectados con el mismo, que facilitaron los contactos entre Teher\u00e1n y Buenos Aires a los fines del objetivo delictivo. Al referirse a un mensaje concreto, Khalil lo ilustr\u00f3 diciendo: \u201c...me tiraron un dato que hay que laburarlo, que me dijeron que lo tengo que transmitir ...bueno, muchachos, t\u00edrenle \u00e9sta a los interlocutores de all\u00e1 para que hablen con los interlocutores de ac\u00e1... \u201d (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 4/11/12, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2012-11-04-130024- 6, CD 182). En otras palabras los canales paralelos contaban con \u201c interlocutores de ac\u00e1\u201d e \u201cinterlocutores de all\u00e1\nEstas pruebas dejaron al descubierto a un grupo de individuos estrechamente vinculado con funcionarios y ex funcionarios de ambos gobiernos que, desde la sombras, contribuyeron estrat\u00e9gica y sustancialmente con las acciones necesarias para avanzar con el objetivo criminal planeado. Entre ellos, cabe destacar la activa participaci\u00f3n de Luis\n\u00c1ngel D'EI\u00eda, Fernando Luis Esteche, Jorge Alejandro \u201cYussuf\u2019 Khalil, el Diputado Nacional Andr\u00e9s Larroque, H\u00e9ctor Luis Yrimia y el individuo identificado como \u201cAlian\u201d perteneciente a la Secretar\u00eda de Inteligencia, org\u00e1nica o inorg\u00e1nicamente, y que podr\u00eda tratarse de Ram\u00f3n H\u00e9ctor Alian Bogado, sea este su verdadero nombre o el que utiliza en su actividad de inteligencia.\nEstos sujetos, implicados en la maniobra de encubrimiento, se encuentran vinculados entre s\u00ed. V\u00e9ase que Jorge \u201cYussuf\u2019 Khalil se comunic\u00f3 asiduamente con D\u2019El\u00eda, con Esteche, con \u201cAlian\u201d, con Yrimia y se reuni\u00f3 en varias oportunidades con Larroque. A su vez, \u201cAlian\u201d e Yrimia responden al mismo sector de la Secretar\u00eda de Inteligencia. Estos dos \u00faltimos personajes le fueron presentados a Khalil por parte de Fernando Esteche, lo que implica que los conoc\u00eda previamente. Las vinculaciones entre D\u2019El\u00eda y Larroque, D\u2019El\u00eda y Esteche y Larroque y Esteche, son p\u00fablicas.\nLo que parece un trabalenguas farragoso para la lectura en realidad es la demostraci\u00f3n concreta que estos sujetos no solo se conocen sino que han tenido actividades conjuntas y, seg\u00fan las pruebas expuestas a lo largo de esta presentaci\u00f3n, todos han participado en la ejecuci\u00f3n del plan de encubrimiento. Queda expuesta as\u00ed, la estrecha y promiscua vinculaci\u00f3n entre los part\u00edcipes del plan de encubrimiento.\nAhora bien, se cuenta con profusa prueba que da cuenta de la existencia de mensajes concretos relativos al objeto de esta denuncia, que han sido comunicados entre autoridades de ambos pa\u00edses por estos canales no oficiales.\nNo cabe duda alguna, la actividad de estos canales de comunicaci\u00f3n y negociaci\u00f3n configura, sin m\u00e1s, una diplomacia paralela de facto. A\u00fan antes de que se hubiera firmado el \u201cMemorando de Entendimiento\u201d, ya en noviembre de 2012, se negociaba por fuera de los canales diplom\u00e1ticos, esto es, por v\u00edas ajenas a las reuniones que paralelamente se manten\u00edan en Suiza.\nEn otras palabras, mientras la diplomacia formal se reun\u00eda en la Confederaci\u00f3n Helv\u00e9tica, los mensajes ocultos entre Teher\u00e1n y Buenos Aires transitaban, en paralelo, otros carriles. Jorge \u201cYussuf\u2019 Khalil explicaba: \u201c...vengo de La Matanza reci\u00e9n he tenido una reuni\u00f3n con Luis D'E/ia y el \u201cCuervo\u201d Larroque, el de la C\u00e1mpora...que me llamaron temprano que quer\u00edan hablar conmigo, que ten\u00edan un mensaje para el gobierno para dar... Y ahora me voy para Mart\u00ednez a dar el mensaje, a la casa del Embajador...\u201d, en referencia al Encargado de Negocios de Ir\u00e1n en Argentina, m\u00e1xima autoridad oficial en territorio nacional (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 17/11/2012, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2012-11-17- 104846-10.wav, CD 195).\nEsta misma secuencia la relat\u00f3 en otra comunicaci\u00f3n telef\u00f3nica: \u201c...volv\u00ed a las once de la noche de Mart\u00ednez....Me fui a La Matanza, estuve hablando con el Cuervo Larroque y con D'El\u00eda...de ah\u00ed me tuve que ir a la casa del embajador a hablar con el embajador para mandar un mensaje que me mandaron...\u201d y agreg\u00f3: \u201c...Larroque...se sent\u00f3 conmigo y me dio un mensaje que tengo que transmitir a la embajada. Fui a la embajada y transmit\u00ed lo que ten\u00eda, pero no fui a la embajada, me tuve que ir hasta Mart\u00ednez...\u201d. Y explic\u00f3 respecto de su relaci\u00f3n con las autoridades argentinas: \u201c...yo no estoy operando para ellos, yo estoy operando para los nuestros, para lo que es la embajada...ellos me mandaron a hacer una cosa, yo como soy el nexo...\u201d (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 18/11/2012, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2012-11-18-100116- 6, CD 196).\nAl d\u00eda siguiente que Jorge \u201cYussuf\u2019 Khalil regres\u00f3 de un viaje a la Rep\u00fablica Isl\u00e1mica de Ir\u00e1n, donde se entrevist\u00f3 \u201ccon las m\u00e1s altas esferas...con los responsables capos...con la canciller\u00eda...\u201d (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 11/05/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-l009-2013-05-11- 173407-12, CD 0022), se comunic\u00f3 con Luis D'El\u00eda y quedaron en reunirse, no obstante lo cual le adelant\u00f3 que hab\u00eda desaz\u00f3n en Ir\u00e1n, aparentemente por el incumplimiento de Timerman, y que -adem\u00e1s- no hab\u00edan gustado algunas declaraciones p\u00fablicas de funcionarios argentinos:\n\u201c...no gust\u00f3 algunas palabras que se dijeron....el comentario ese que dijo: \"\u00a1A ver si ustedes se piensan que a m\u00ed me gusta negociar con fulanito, con los iran\u00edes!\u201d....eso qued\u00f3 para el orto, pero igual yo te lo voy a transmitir bien cosa que vos lo transmitas por abajo...como quien no quiere la cosa...\u201d (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 11/5/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B- 1009-2013-05-ll-083146-8.wav, CD 0022, el subrayado es propio). Los mensajes, con toda su tonalidad, llegaban directamente de Teher\u00e1n a la Casa Rosada.\nEstos son ejemplos contundentes que prueban que ciertas autoridades argentinas utilizaron estos canales de comunicaci\u00f3n paralelos, no oficiales y totalmente secretos para avanzar con el plan de encubrimiento. Tambi\u00e9n queda perfectamente constatado el rol de cada uno de estos actores: Larroque, D'El\u00eda y Khalil, cumplen en la maniobra criminal. Funcionan como nexos entre las m\u00e1ximas autoridades pol\u00edticas argentinas e iran\u00edes. Es m\u00e1s, Larroque es quien recibe de la Presidente, por lo general, las ordenes que luego llegan a Luis D'El\u00eda. Tan claro como inaudito.\nEstos canales tambi\u00e9n fueron utilizados para hacerle llegar informaci\u00f3n actualizada a Mohsen Rabbani, uno de los imputados por el atentado contra la AMIA, de distintos aspectos configurativos del plan destinado a encubrirlo. Cabe recordar el poder decisorio que \u00e9ste imputado sigue manteniendo, que le ha permitido intervenir directa y personalmente en las negociaciones entre iran\u00edes y argentinos.\nN\u00f3tese que la actitud de Rabbani no es la de un pr\u00f3fugo preocupado por su situaci\u00f3n procesal o por la evoluci\u00f3n de la acusaci\u00f3n en su contra. Al contrario, al poseer un alto grado de seguridad que se mantendr\u00e1 impune gracias a la protecci\u00f3n del r\u00e9gimen de su pa\u00eds, tiene tiempo y energ\u00edas para continuar dando \u00f3rdenes a la distancia y digitando el accionar de la comunidad chiita en Argentina. Por si ello fuera poco, \u00faltimamente ha tomado incluso mayor confianza al advertir la buena predisposici\u00f3n de las autoridades del gobierno argentino para con su persona.\nEllo se ve reflejado en sus di\u00e1logos. \u201c...Yo les dije que nosotros ...hab\u00edamos conversado con Argentina...Ir\u00e1n fue el primer comprador de Argentina y ahora no compra casi nada...pero...puede cambiar esta situaci\u00f3n con ustedes y con el gobierno\u201d, en alusi\u00f3n a los actuales referentes de Ir\u00e1n en Argentina, como Khalil, y las autoridades del presente gobierno argentino (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 28/5/13, abonado 11-3238- 4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-05-28-155549-2, CD 39).\nOtro ejemplo de ello es el reporte de Jorge Khalil cuando comunic\u00f3:\t\u201c...hoy terminamos una reuni\u00f3n con el Ministro de\nPlanificaci\u00f3n De Vido, en donde \u00e9l est\u00e1 dispuesto a mandar a las m\u00e1ximas autoridades de YPF para arreglar con la Rep\u00fablica Isl\u00e1mica y la transacci\u00f3n puede ser a trav\u00e9s de granos y a trav\u00e9s de otras cosas...\u201d, a lo que Rabbani respondi\u00f3: \u201c...M\u00e1ndame para que eval\u00fae...\u201d (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 20/5/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-05-20- 114842-2, CD 31). Y, luego de analizarlo, contest\u00f3: \u201c...aqu\u00ed hay algunos sectores del gobierno que me dijeron que est\u00e1n listos para vender petr\u00f3leo a la Argentina...y tambi\u00e9n comprar armas... \u201d (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 28/5/13, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-05-28-155549-2, CD 39).\nTambi\u00e9n cabe hacer referencia que estos canales paralelos han sido utilizados para digitar acciones y comportamientos que facilitaron -de distintas maneras- el avance del plan de impunidad.\nPor ejemplo, para noviembre de 2012, tanto Luis D'El\u00eda como Andr\u00e9s Larroque le solicitaron a Khalil que no se sumara a una marcha organizada por partidos de izquierda en defensa de la \u201ccausa palestina\u201d y, tambi\u00e9n, que cesara con los reproches y reclamos, porque ese tipo de acciones pod\u00edan repercutir en las nuevas relaciones bilaterales.\nAs\u00ed lo explicaba Khalil: \u201c...no queremos hacer algo que irrite...no queremos irritar al gobierno argentino...no voy a hacer nada para irritar al gobierno argentino... \u201d y agreg\u00f3 \u201c...estamos arreglando un problema mayor para nosotros...\u201d, en alusi\u00f3n a las imputaciones por el atentado contra la AMIA, y ello ameritaba cautela. Khalil comprendi\u00f3 el riesgo de participar de estos actos: \u201c...Me imagino que los troskos van a empezar con mensajes en contra del gobierno, cosa que yo no quiero...\u201d (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 16/11/2012, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-\n2012-\t11 -16-225815-2, CD 194). El plan de encubrimiento demandaba todas las precauciones posibles.\nRespecto al mismo tema Khalil agreg\u00f3: \u201c...Hoy a la ma\u00f1ana tuve una reuni\u00f3n con la gente del gobierno, me pidieron que por favor no vaya a la reuni\u00f3n... \u201d y le dijeron: \u201c...par\u00e1 la bronca porque el tema de...puede repercutir en las relaciones que est\u00e1n manteniendo, las conversaciones que estamos teniendo nosotros en Ginebra... \u201d (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 17/11/2012, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-\n2012-\t11-17-183444-8, CD 195). Y decidi\u00f3: \u201c...Entonces no quiero que ninguno de nosotros, que representa a la Rep\u00fablica Isl\u00e1mica de una u otra manera, como vos, como Ghaleb, como yo, como cualquiera de Flores o de la comunidad nuestra, no tiene que ir a ninguno de esos, no va a participar, en tanto y en cuanto Israel no invada....Ahora, si Israel invade...nosotros armamos un frente, no con los troskos ni con los de izquierda, con los kirchneristas, La C\u00e1mpora y todos esos van a acompa\u00f1arnos. Ya lo habl\u00e9 con Larroquey con D'El\u00eda... \u201d (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 17/11/2012, abonado 11- 3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2012-11-17-183444-8, CD 195).\nY\treiter\u00f3:\t\u201c\t...nosotros no estamos haciendo ninguna\nmanifestaci\u00f3n ac\u00e1, porque estamos en plenas negociaciones con el gobierno...a esa reuni\u00f3n la convoqu\u00e9 y o...pero despu\u00e9s la tir\u00e9 para atr\u00e1s ...porque en base a las negociaciones que se est\u00e1n haciendo entre Ir\u00e1n y Argentina, no queremos vernos inmiscuidos nosotros. Aparte fue un pedido del gobierno. Yo estuve hablando con D'El\u00eda y con el Cuervo Larroque y me pidieron eso y yo lo transmit\u00ed al Safir...y el Safir me dijo lo mismo... 'no hagamos algo que, que pueda molestar'....\u201d (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 18/11/2012, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2012-11-18- 095153-16, CD 196).\nEn conversaci\u00f3n con Fernando Esteche expres\u00f3 \u201c...el s\u00e1bado fui a la casa del gordo, habl\u00e9 con el gordo y el gordo adelante m\u00edo lo llam\u00f3 al cuervo, puso el altavoz...Cuervo, estoy con Yussefbla bla bla...le estoy diciendo que lo que me dijiste que transmita. As\u00ed, eh?...\u201d. A esta altura, sobra aclarar que cuando se alude al \u201cgordo\u201d y al \u201ccuervo\u201d, se est\u00e1 haciendo referencia a Luis D'El\u00eda y Andr\u00e9s Larroque, respectivamente (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 19/11/2012, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-\n2012-\t11-19-121034-16, CD 197).\nDe esta serie de comunicaciones, puede concluirse que Khalil no estaba dispuesto a involucrarse, como referente de Ir\u00e1n, en un ataque al gobierno por parte de \u201clos troskos\u201d y/o cualquier agrupaci\u00f3n pol\u00edtica, para no poner en peligro las negociaciones que se manten\u00edan con Teher\u00e1n. D'El\u00eda y Larroque compart\u00edan esta preocupaci\u00f3n y trabajaron para que Khalil y sus seguidores se mantuvieran al margen de cualquier manifestaci\u00f3n y/o cr\u00edtica p\u00fablica al gobierno por la posici\u00f3n adoptada ante hechos internacionales relacionados con el conflicto palestino-israel\u00ed.\nTanto Larroque como D\u2019El\u00eda efectuaron sus aportes para asegurar y mantener el mejor clima posible entre las partes, mientras se ejecutaba el plan de encubrimiento ordenado por Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez y llevado adelante por H\u00e9ctor Timerman.\nOtro ejemplo que demuestra la voluntad de proteger el plan de encubrimiento se desprende del episodio que tuvo lugar el 29 de mayo de 2013, cuando tom\u00f3 estado p\u00fablico el dictamen de esta Unidad Fiscal sobre la profundizaci\u00f3n de ciertos aspectos relativos al atentado contra la AMIA, entre los que se estudiaba, la infiltraci\u00f3n de la regi\u00f3n por parte de estructuras de inteligencia iran\u00ed. En esa ocasi\u00f3n, Jorge Khalil y otros miembros de la comunidad local planeaban hacer alg\u00fan tipo de descargo p\u00fablico, pero recibieron indicaciones desde Ir\u00e1n de abstenerse de ello, para no hacer peligrar las relaciones con Argentina y, obviamente, la maniobra encubridora.\nAl respecto, sostuvo: \u201c...le est\u00e1n pidiendo que no hagamos nada...el de ac\u00e1 ya me dijo no hagamos nada, no hagamos nada, no hagamos nada, pero no hagamos nada porque no quiere que se pudra en la relaci\u00f3n de ellos...\u201d (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 04/06/2013, abonado 11-3238- 4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-06-04-082254-20, CD 46). En este caso, las\nindicaciones de Teher\u00e1n le llegaron a Khalil a trav\u00e9s de Abdul Karim Paz, que es quien \u201cle est\u00e1n pidiendo que no hagamos nadan y con \u201cel de ac\u00e1\u201d, alude al Encargado de Negocios de Ir\u00e1n en Argentina. En suma, el encubrimiento era lo m\u00e1s importante y no deb\u00eda verse afectado por cuestiones coyunturales.\nPor \u00faltimo, estos canales paralelos contribuyeron al desarrollo de acciones destinadas a la creaci\u00f3n de una versi\u00f3n alternativa y falsa sobre el atentado, veros\u00edmil a la opini\u00f3n p\u00fablica, que permita redireccionar la pesquisa hacia \u201cnuevos imputados\u201d, encubriendo en forma definitiva a los acusados iran\u00edes, a quienes las pruebas y las distintas resoluciones judiciales los involucran muy claramente en el atentado.\nIlustran este punto las numerosas comunicaciones entre el referente iran\u00ed Jorge Khalil y otros part\u00edcipes, fundamentalmente, Fernando Esteche, H\u00e9ctor Yrimia y el agente de inteligencia \u201cAlian\u201d. Para mayor abundamiento, corresponde remitirse a lo desarrollado en el punto IV.c.3.b de la presente.\nEn suma, en los puntos anteriores se han ejemplificado episodios que muestran el modo en que circularon mensajes, pedidos, inquietudes, informaci\u00f3n, etc., de un lado al otro del conjunto de individuos involucrados en el plan de encubrimiento aqu\u00ed expuesto. Lo descripto en este punto permite visualizar el modo mediante el cual los autores del plan lograron establecer un v\u00ednculo indirecto, a trav\u00e9s del conjunto de intermediarios, no s\u00f3lo con los referentes iran\u00edes en Teher\u00e1n sino con uno de los imputados por el atentado contra la AMIA, Mohsen Rabbani, cuya detenci\u00f3n con fines de extradici\u00f3n ha sido exhortada por la justicia argentina y es requerido con la m\u00e1xima prioridad de b\u00fasqueda por Interpol.\nA continuaci\u00f3n corresponde analizar el rol y los aportes de cada uno de los individuos antes mencionados, que tuvieron participaci\u00f3n en el plan criminal aqu\u00ed denunciado.\na)\tCristina Elisabet Fern\u00e1ndez\nPara comprender el rol de la Dra. Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez en este plan de impunidad debe quedar claro que el delito denunciado no se hubiera cometido sin su decisi\u00f3n y sus consecuentes acciones.\nEn efecto, la Sra. Presidente de la Naci\u00f3n Argentina ha emitido una expresa directiva para que se dise\u00f1ara y ejecutara un plan de encubrimiento tendiente a desvincular a los acusados de nacionalidad iran\u00ed en la causa por el atentado contra la sede de la AMIA, a efectos de garantizarles su impunidad definitiva.\nDicha decisi\u00f3n estuvo motivada en la b\u00fasqueda de un acercamiento de car\u00e1cter geopol\u00edtico como as\u00ed tambi\u00e9n en el restablecimiento de plenas relaciones comerciales a nivel estatal con la Rep\u00fablica Isl\u00e1mica de Ir\u00e1n, por entender que as\u00ed podr\u00eda atenuarse sustancialmente la crisis energ\u00e9tica nacional, mediante intercambios mercantiles de \u201cpetr\u00f3leo por granos\u201d.\nLa circunstancia que haya sido la m\u00e1s alta autoridad de la Rep\u00fablica qui\u00e9n orden\u00f3 la ejecuci\u00f3n de estas acciones delictivas implica que lo aqu\u00ed se denuncia es de una gravedad institucional enorme. Analizada la evidencia con el m\u00e1ximo grado de rigor, surge de modo inequ\u00edvoco la participaci\u00f3n de la primera mandataria en el plan criminal aqu\u00ed denunciado. En varias oportunidades, los part\u00edcipes del plan criminal han hecho referencia a ello, asegurando que todo est\u00e1: \u201ccerrado muy arriba\u201d, todo hab\u00eda sido decidido \u201cal m\u00e1s alto niver porque \u201clo pidi\u00f3 la jefa\u201d y su canciller, obediente, implemento el plan porque fue \u201corden, orden y orden\u201d (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 6/2/2013, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009- 2013-02-06-203822-26, CD 276, Comunicaci\u00f3n del 20/5/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-05-20-111124-8, CD 31; Comunicaci\u00f3n del 28/01/13, abonado 11-315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2013- 01 -28-135732-18.wav, CD 267).\nNo puede soslayarse la consternaci\u00f3n que provoca constatar que la Sra. Presidente se encuentre involucrada en una vil maquinaci\u00f3n, destinada nada menos que a dejar de lado la b\u00fasqueda de justicia en la causa que investiga el mayor atentado terrorista sufrido en la historia argentina.\n\n\nMinisterio P\u00fablico de la Naci\u00f3n\nLamentablemente, como es de p\u00fablico conocimiento, no es la primera vez que el conductor de los destinos de la Naci\u00f3n cae inmerso en acciones criminales para desviar la investigaci\u00f3n del caso AMIA.\nTal fue el grado de compromiso que asumi\u00f3 la Dra. Fern\u00e1ndez en este plan criminal de impunidad que se ocup\u00f3 de seleccionar muy cuidadosamente a algunos de sus colaboradores o, para ser m\u00e1s exactos, sus c\u00f3mplices, vali\u00e9ndose de distintas personas para ejecutar el plan. Ese ha sido uno de sus aportes fundamentales para la instrumentaci\u00f3n del plan.\nCuando se observan y se analizan las credenciales de cada uno de los part\u00edcipes, puede advertirse que la elecci\u00f3n fue acertada pues todos poseen los antecedentes y las condiciones necesarias para cumplir fielmente los encargos de la Presidente.\nEn primer lugar, se vali\u00f3 de un sujeto identificado como \u201cAlian\u201d, hombre de su entorno, consustanciado con el r\u00e9gimen iran\u00ed, contacto directo del m\u00e1ximo referente de dicho pa\u00eds en Argentina y miembro de la Secretar\u00eda de Inteligencia de Presidencia de la Naci\u00f3n; para que asista al se\u00f1or canciller en todas aquellas acciones, relacionadas con la implementaci\u00f3n del plan de encubrimiento, que por ser notoriamente delictivas, de ninguna manera convendr\u00eda que fueran realizadas por un encumbrado ministro nacional. La circunstancia de que \u201cAlian\u201d cumpla funciones -org\u00e1nicas o inorg\u00e1nicas- para el organismo de inteligencia nacional no es un dato menor. Todo lo contrario, dicha pertenencia le permite aprovechar los recursos de tal secretar\u00eda de estado, lo que lo hace especialmente apto para cumplir con su tarea.\nTambi\u00e9n encarg\u00f3 al dirigente Luis D\u2019El\u00eda que se ocupe de transmitir y recibir todos los mensajes que circularon a trav\u00e9s de los canales paralelos de comunicaci\u00f3n y negociaci\u00f3n desarrollados para llevar a buen puerto el encubrimiento. La decisi\u00f3n de la Presidente, en este caso, tambi\u00e9n fue apropiada pues D\u2019El\u00eda ha sido, por muchos a\u00f1os, no solo ac\u00e9rrimo defensor del r\u00e9gimen iran\u00ed sino, seg\u00fan sus propios dichos, un \u201csoldado\u201d incondicional de Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez.\nAsimismo, escogi\u00f3 al Diputado Nacional Andr\u00e9s Larroque, otro encendido seguidor de la Presidente, que ofici\u00f3 de nexo, de puente entre ella y los part\u00edcipes clandestinos del plan de impunidad. La necesidad de contar con un intermediario es obvia. Trat\u00e1ndose de la ejecuci\u00f3n de un delito, la primera mandataria ha preferido, astutamente, mantenerse incomunicada de aquellas personas que ejecutan las acciones criminales. Dado que los c\u00f3mplices deb\u00edan actuar siguiendo sus \u00f3rdenes, result\u00f3 imperioso contar con una persona de extrema confianza que pudiera justificar su vinculaci\u00f3n personal tanto con la Dra. Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez como con Luis D\u2019El\u00eda y dicho sujeto result\u00f3 ser el nombrado Larroque.\nY\tprincipalmente, deleg\u00f3 gran parte de la instrumentaci\u00f3n del plan criminal en su Canciller, H\u00e9ctor Timerman, a quien inicialmente orden\u00f3 que contacte a los representantes iran\u00edes a los fines de hacerles saber la predisposici\u00f3n del gobierno argentino a dejar de lado cualquier reclamo de justicia en relaci\u00f3n al caso AMIA, a cambio de un acercamiento comercial entre ambos pa\u00edses, lo que comenz\u00f3 en 2011 en la ciudad de Alepo.\nEn concreto, por orden presidencial, Timerman se apart\u00f3 de la comitiva oficial que visitaba distintos pa\u00edses de Medio Oriente, para dirigirse a la ciudad siria de Alepo, lugar donde mantuvo, en secreto, una reuni\u00f3n con el canciller iran\u00ed, Ali Salehi. All\u00ed transmiti\u00f3 el siguiente mensaje: \u201c...la Argentina ya no est\u00e1 m\u00e1s interesada en resolver aquellos dos atentados, pero en cambio prefiere mejorar sus relaciones econ\u00f3micas con Ir\u00e1n... \u201d (Ys. 131.189/131.194; Eliaschev, Pepe, \u201cArgentina negocia con Ir\u00e1n dejar de lado la investigaci\u00f3n de los atentados\u201d, Diario Perfil, 26/03/2011, fs. 130.911/130.913; Eliaschev, Pepe, \u201cPol\u00e9mica en torno a la negociaci\u00f3n secreta entre Argentina e Ir\u00e1n\u201d, Diario Perfil, 2/4/2011).\nSus instrucciones incluyeron la autorizaci\u00f3n para que el Ministro Timerman negociara e instrumentara, en forma secreta, el plan de impunidad que remover\u00eda el escollo que significa la acusaci\u00f3n judicial argentina contra los ciudadanos iran\u00edes. Dicho plan, incluy\u00f3 la decisi\u00f3n presidencial de instrumentar en el Memorando de Entendimiento un\nAl BERTO NISMAN\nFISCAL GENERAL\nmecanismo que permita disponer el cese de las notificaciones rojas, por ser ese el \u00fanico real inter\u00e9s del r\u00e9gimen iran\u00ed. Y ello qued\u00f3 plasmado en el punto s\u00e9ptimo del pacto.\nEl plan de impunidad perge\u00f1ado por la Dra. Fern\u00e1ndez fue mucho m\u00e1s all\u00e1 del cese de estas prioridades de b\u00fasqueda de Interpol e incluy\u00f3 la desvinculaci\u00f3n definitiva de los imputados iran\u00edes. Por eso, su instrumentaci\u00f3n conllev\u00f3 la creaci\u00f3n de una \u201cComisi\u00f3n de la Verdad\u201d, como se dispuso en el pacto, cuyas conclusiones estaban arregladas de antemano y garantizar\u00edan la acordada impunidad. En conocimiento de esta circunstancia, se dijo: \u201c...alguien va a salir...con la cara manchada de ac\u00e1...\u201d, a lo que Jorge Khalil, referente de Ir\u00e1n, reconoci\u00f3: \u201c...Obvio, eso ya est\u00e1 arreglado...\u201d, pero aclar\u00f3 que no iban a ser de los iran\u00edes los perjudicados y remat\u00f3: \u201c... \u00a1\u00bfc\u00f3mo va a ser para el lado nuestro, boludo?!

Presidente, esta vez canalizada a trav\u00e9s del agente \u201cAlian\u201d, fue la orden de construir una hip\u00f3tesis falsa, sostenida en pruebas inventadas, para incriminar a \u201cnuevos autores del atentado\u201d, que ser\u00edan acusados con el fin de desvincular definitivamente del hecho a los imputados iran\u00edes. Justamente, \ufffd\ufffdAlian\u201d dio cuenta de esta orden, al reconocer que el suscripto \u201c...va a hacer culo al norte, porque nunca las vio, \u00e9l, las pruebas...lo que viene ahora... es una prueba contundente...\u201d (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 01/06/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009- 2013-06-01-224726-18, CD 43). Esta cuesti\u00f3n ya hab\u00eda sido mencionada por Fernando Esteche, otro part\u00edcipe del plan, quien aun antes de suscribirse el memorando, dijo: \u201c...quieren construir un nuevo enemigo de la AMIA, el nuevo responsable de la AMIA...\u201d, tarea a cargo de los servicios de inteligencia.

Presidente se pretendi\u00f3 -y as\u00ed se hizo- ocultar que ya ven\u00edan manteni\u00e9ndose un a\u00f1o y medio de negociaciones secretas y que el acercamiento se hab\u00eda materializado por iniciativa de Argentina, y no de Ir\u00e1n, como se afirm\u00f3. No pod\u00eda reconocer p\u00fablicamente que le hab\u00eda ordenado a su Canciller que ofreciera a las autoridades iran\u00edes impunidad para sus nacionales, a cambio de un acercamiento geopol\u00edtico y comercial.\nComo ya se dijo, este plan criminal exigi\u00f3 contar con el mayor apoyo posible de la opini\u00f3n p\u00fablica y -fundamentalmente- de las v\u00edctimas, respecto del acuerdo que se firmar\u00eda y se firm\u00f3 con Ir\u00e1n, como una forma de facilitar su ejecuci\u00f3n. Para ello, se ocultaron las negociaciones previas y la iniciativa Argentina, y con el mismo fin, en septiembre de 2012, la Sra. Presidente prometi\u00f3, a sabiendas de que no cumplir\u00eda, que consultar\u00eda a familiares y v\u00edctimas, previo adoptar cualquier temperamento sobre las tratativas con Teher\u00e1n. Solamente buscaba inspirar una falsa confianza en las v\u00edctimas del atentado, prometi\u00e9ndoles que ser\u00edan consultados, para luego sorprenderlos con el acuerdo ya consumado, el domingo 27 de enero de 2013 (Discurso de Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez ante la 67a Asamblea General de las Naciones Unidas, de fecha 25 de septiembre de 2012; Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto, Informaci\u00f3n para la prensa N\u00b0 011/13).\nEn la misma l\u00ednea, y abusando de su cargo y funciones, continu\u00f3 encabezando el despliegue de una versi\u00f3n oficial y falsa de los hechos, para ocultar la criminalidad del verdadero plan.

El mismo d\u00eda de la aprobaci\u00f3n emiti\u00f3 en su cuenta oficial de Twitter, una seguidilla de mensajes que pretendieron instalar la noticia como una \u201cvictoria\u201d, ello a fin de mantener oculto el verdadero sentido del Memorando de Entendimiento: brindar un marco jur\u00eddico cre\u00edble para instrumentar solapadamente la impunidad de los acusados iran\u00edes y as\u00ed, viabilizar pol\u00edticamente el acercamiento geopol\u00edtico y comercial con Teher\u00e1n.\nContinu\u00f3 en esa tesitura cuando, en su mensaje de elevaci\u00f3n del anteproyecto de ley de aprobaci\u00f3n del Memorando al Congreso Nacional, sostuvo: \u201c...Se quiere presentar el acuerdo como una especie de argucia para \u2018iniciar \u2019 el comercio con Ir\u00e1n. Lo cierto es que ese comercio existe desde 1990 y, salvo los a\u00f1os 2004 y 2005, ha sido super\u00e1vit ario...\u201d (Mensaje Presidencial N\u00b0 173 de elevaci\u00f3n al Congreso Nacional del anteproyecto de ley sobre el Memorando de Entendimiento entre Argentina e Ir\u00e1n).\nMaliciosamente, la Sra. Presidente se estaba refiriendo al comercio entre privados. No pod\u00eda admitir que hab\u00eda decidido aniquilar la justicia en el caso AMIA a cambio de establecer un comercio a nivel estatal que no exist\u00eda y que buscaba retomar.\nA pesar de negar p\u00fablicamente que el comercio fuera un inter\u00e9s en la vinculaci\u00f3n con Ir\u00e1n, en forma secreta, la Sra. Presidente busc\u00f3 poner en pr\u00e1ctica su decisi\u00f3n de comerciar con Teher\u00e1n, encomendando gestiones a su Ministro de Planificaci\u00f3n Federal, Arquitecto Julio De Vido. Para ello, le orden\u00f3 que avance en las tratativas para intercambiar petr\u00f3leo por granos a trav\u00e9s de los canales paralelos de comunicaci\u00f3n con el r\u00e9gimen.

Fern\u00e1ndez, se hallaba embarcado en negociaciones secretas con Ir\u00e1n para intercambiar petr\u00f3leo por carne y granos. Y, como ya se prob\u00f3, de estas mismas tratativas comerciales particip\u00f3 Mohsen Rabbani, uno de los acusados en la causa AMIA. Ejemplo de ello es la ocasi\u00f3n en que Khalil le inform\u00f3 a Rabbani: \u201c...hoy terminamos una reuni\u00f3n con el Ministro de Planificaci\u00f3n De Vido, en donde \u00e9l est\u00e1 dispuesto a mandar a las m\u00e1ximas autoridades de YPF para arreglar con la Rep\u00fablica Isl\u00e1mica y la transacci\u00f3n puede ser a trav\u00e9s de granos y a trav\u00e9s de otras cosas... \u201d, a lo que Rabbani contest\u00f3: \u201cm\u00e1ndeme para que eval\u00fae\u201d y luego de evaluarlo respondi\u00f3: \u201c...aqu\u00ed hay algunos sectores del gobierno que me dijeron que\nest\u00e1n listos para vender petr\u00f3leo a la Argentina...y tambi\u00e9n comprar armas.. \u2019\u2019(Comunicaci\u00f3n del 20/5/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B- 1009-2013-05-20-114842-2, CD 31 y del 28/5/13, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-05-28-155549-2, CD 39).\nEs decir, mientras p\u00fablicamente la Sra. Presidente aseguraba que sus acciones estaban exclusivamente motivadas en la b\u00fasqueda de justicia para la causa AMIA y que el Memorando de Entendimiento era la \u00fanica soluci\u00f3n viable para el caso, uno de esos acusados, Mohsen Rabbani, secreta y clandestinamente negociaba con nuestras autoridades a trav\u00e9s de intermediarios y canales ocultos un intercambio de petr\u00f3leo por granos, la venta de armas y, lo que es m\u00e1s grave, su propia impunidad.\nLa siguiente contribuci\u00f3n para la consecuci\u00f3n del plan de impunidad fue instalar, desde lo m\u00e1s alto del poder, la versi\u00f3n de que la causa por la investigaci\u00f3n del atentado contra la sede de la AMIA estaba paralizada, con la intenci\u00f3n de confundir a la opini\u00f3n p\u00fablica y as\u00ed poder presentar ante la sociedad argentina que el Memorando de Entendimiento - recu\u00e9rdese, el instrumento dise\u00f1ado para viabilizar la impunidad de los acusados iran\u00edes- era la \u00fanica salida posible.\nDicha intervenci\u00f3n se desdobl\u00f3 en varios episodios y se mantuvo a lo largo del tiempo. En efecto, en su mensaje por cadena nacional del 8 de febrero de 2013, en ocasi\u00f3n de comunicar el env\u00edo del anteproyecto de ley de ratificaci\u00f3n del Memorando al Congreso Nacional expres\u00f3: \u201c...Este memor\u00e1ndum que hemos acordado es un paso adelante para destrabar una causa que hace 19 a\u00f1os que est\u00e1 paral izada... \u201d (Discurso de Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez del 8/2/13).\nEn marzo de 2013, escribi\u00f3 en las redes sociales \u201c...ten\u00edamos que destrabar esto...\u201d, obviamente en alusi\u00f3n a la causa AMIA (Twitter del 4/3/2013 17:05) y ante la Asamblea Legislativa: \u201c...mi compromiso es intentar destrabar esto...'1'' (Mensaje de la Presidente a la Asamblea Legislativa con motivo de la apertura del 131\u00b0 per\u00edodo de sesiones ordinarias del Congreso de la Naci\u00f3n, 1/3/2013).\nVolvi\u00f3 a la carga con la misma mentira en su discurso ante 68\u00b0 Asamblea General de Naciones Unidas, la Sra. Presidente afirm\u00f3: \u201c...la causa est\u00e1 estancada, desde hace 19 a\u00f1os que no se moviliza...'\u2019'\u2019 (Discurso ante Naciones Unidas del 24 de septiembre de 2013).\nLo parad\u00f3jico del caso es que la Sra. Presidente conoce, sin lugar a dudas, que la causa ha avanzado, m\u00e1xime teniendo en cuenta la amplia publicidad que tuvieron los sucesivos dict\u00e1menes de esta Unidad Fiscal y diferentes pronunciamientos judiciales, por lo que sus expresiones en sentido contrario solo puede ser tomadas como una manifestaci\u00f3n concreta del dolo con que ha actuado buscando desprestigiar a la justicia argentina como un modo indirecto de legitimar un acuerdo bilateral -l\u00e9ase Memorando de Entendimiento- que es la base de un plan criminal por ella misma ideado.\nOtra de sus contribuciones tuvo lugar el viernes 27 de septiembre de 2013, un d\u00eda antes del encuentro entre los Ministros de Relaciones Exteriores argentino e iran\u00ed, cuando le orden\u00f3 al c\u00f3mplice Luis D\u2019El\u00eda que transmitiera un mensaje al agente persa Jorge Khalil.

Presidente que se han podido acreditar con s\u00f3lido sustento probatorio, surge con claridad que no solamente fue quien decidi\u00f3 la articulaci\u00f3n de este plan criminal de impunidad y, para ello, se vali\u00f3 de distintos actores para llevar adelante su ejecuci\u00f3n, sino que en todo momento estuvo en control de la misma, ya sea impartiendo \u00f3rdenes directas a sus c\u00f3mplices, o bien encabezando la necesaria campa\u00f1a discursiva para camuflar la perpetraci\u00f3n del delito.\nSe est\u00e1 en presencia de la persona que ejerce el m\u00e1ximo cargo p\u00fablico de la Rep\u00fablica Argentina. De all\u00ed que su responsabilidad sea enorme. Lamentablemente, ha decidido cometer un delito para brindar impunidad a los pr\u00f3fugos iran\u00edes de la causa AMIA; ha elegido a algunos part\u00edcipes de la maniobra delictiva, involucrando directamente a -cuanto menos- uno de sus ministros y a un legislador nacional; ha controlado la evoluci\u00f3n del plan; ha negociado por interp\u00f3sitas personas con uno de los pr\u00f3fugos; y se ha involucrado personalmente en algunas acciones de ocultamiento que este sofisticado plan requer\u00eda. Los episodios relatados en este cap\u00edtulo as\u00ed lo demuestran.\nb)\tH\u00e9ctor Marcos Timerman\nEl Ministro de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto de la Naci\u00f3n, H\u00e9ctor Timerman, ha sido -sin duda alguna- el principal instrumentador del plan de impunidad ideado y ordenado por la Sra. Presidente, Dra. Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez.\nNaturalmente, trat\u00e1ndose de un plan criminal que ha involucrado a un pa\u00eds extranjero, el Canciller ocupaba el puesto clave para encargarse personalmente de muchos aspectos de este encubrimiento. Desde su funci\u00f3n, transmiti\u00f3 a Ir\u00e1n la decisi\u00f3n del gobierno argentino de abandonar el reclamo de justicia en la causa AMIA; acord\u00f3 la baja de las notificaciones rojas; sign\u00f3 acuerdos secretos con la parte iran\u00ed; particip\u00f3 de las negociaciones, de la redacci\u00f3n y de la firma del Memorando de Entendimiento, pieza central del plan de impunidad. Y se involucr\u00f3 personalmente en la campa\u00f1a de descr\u00e9dito y enga\u00f1o, destinada a destruir la credibilidad de la causa judicial con el fin de, dolosamente, presentar al acuerdo con Ir\u00e1n como la \u00fanica v\u00eda apta para solucionar el caso.\nEl repaso concreto de cada una de sus intervenciones y aportes al plan delictivo aqu\u00ed denunciado demuestra con absoluta claridad y solidez probatoria que H\u00e9ctor Timerman result\u00f3 ser un actor esencial en la maniobra para lograr la impunidad prevista para los acusados iran\u00edes. La prueba en su contra es abrumadora.\nEn efecto, el comienzo de su actuaci\u00f3n criminal coincidi\u00f3 con el inicio de la ejecuci\u00f3n del delito. Por orden presidencial, se apart\u00f3 de la comitiva oficial que visitaba distintos pa\u00edses de Medio Oriente, para dirigirse a la ciudad siria de Alepo, lugar donde mantuvo, en secreto, una reuni\u00f3n con el canciller iran\u00ed, Ali Salehi. All\u00ed transmiti\u00f3 el siguiente mensaje: \u201c...la Argentina ya no est\u00e1 m\u00e1s interesada en resolver aquellos dos atentados, pero en cambio prefiere mejorar sus relaciones econ\u00f3micas con Ir\u00e1n... \u201d ffs. 131.189/131.194; Eliaschev, Pepe, \u201cArgentina negocia con Ir\u00e1n dejar de lado la investigaci\u00f3n de los atentados\u201d, Diario Perfil, 26/03/2011, fs. 130.911/130.913; Eliaschev, Pepe, \u201cPol\u00e9mica en tomo a la negociaci\u00f3n secreta entre Argentina e Ir\u00e1n\u201d, Diario Perfil, 2/4/2011).\nEn este plan, H\u00e9ctor Timerman comand\u00f3 las tratativas con los representantes iran\u00edes, aquellas que se mantuvieron en secreto y tambi\u00e9n las que tomaron estado p\u00fablico. Es decir, Timerman desempe\u00f1\u00f3 un rol central en la negociaci\u00f3n con la contraparte iran\u00ed, para convenir la impunidad definitiva de los pr\u00f3fugos, as\u00ed como el cese de las notificaciones rojas.\nUna contribuci\u00f3n central al plan de impunidad del Ministro Timerman ha sido, sin lugar a dudas, la suscripci\u00f3n del Memorando de\n18\tEl d\u00eda mundial de Al Quds, simboliza la unidad de las naciones, en particular, de los musulmanes, con el fin de apoyar a los palestinos contra los Estados Unidos y el r\u00e9gimen israel\u00ed.\nw\nMinisterio P\u00fablico de la Naci\u00f3n\talberto nis^wn I\nEntendimiento en representaci\u00f3n de la Rep\u00fablica Argentina, pues se trat\u00f3 de una acci\u00f3n definitiva en la ejecuci\u00f3n del plan criminal.\nCon la firma de este acuerdo Timerman aport\u00f3 el instrumento legal necesario para el plan criminal, dado que permite encubrir a los acusados de distintas maneras: a) propiciando el cese de las notificaciones rojas de Interpol (punto 7); b) garantizando impunidad mediante la instauraci\u00f3n acordada de un procedimiento intrincado, infinito, que no conduce a nada y que solo diluye acusaciones y viabiliza desincriminaci\u00f3n, alternativa notablemente favorecida por la ausencia total de plazos que marquen la implementaci\u00f3n del acuerdo; y c) articulando, a trav\u00e9s de la \u201cComisi\u00f3n de la Verdad\u201d creada en el pacto, la desvinculaci\u00f3n total de los imputados respecto del atentado contra la AMIA, permitiendo redireccionar la pesquisa hacia otros autores e hip\u00f3tesis.\nEn efecto, como se ha sostenido y probado, el Memorando de Entendimiento no pretendi\u00f3 que los acusados iran\u00edes declararan ante el juez y el fiscal de la causa AMIA. Todo lo contrario, se trat\u00f3 de uno de los medios elegidos por los socios del plan criminal para eliminar las imputaciones de la justicia argentina y para, en definitiva, garantizar su definitiva impunidad en la causa.\nAdem\u00e1s de la suscripci\u00f3n del Memorando de Entendimiento, otro aporte al plan criminal, por parte del Ministro Timerman, ha sido la concreci\u00f3n de otros acuerdos de car\u00e1cter secreto, que incluyen -justamente- el cese de las notificaciones rojas, y tambi\u00e9n conceden beneficios mayores como, por ejemplo, que el ex Ministro de Defensa, Ahmad Vahidi, aun con el acuerdo vigente, jam\u00e1s se presentar\u00eda ante el juez de la causa.\nExisten comunicaciones telef\u00f3nicas obtenidas de intervenciones judicialmente dispuestas que dan cuenta de estos acuerdos secretos al hablar, por ejemplo, de que \u201cestaba firmado algo, donde estaba el tema de las cautelares tambi\u00e9n\u201d (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 11/5/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-05-ll-083146-8.wav, CD 0022). O cuando, en relaci\u00f3n a la noticia que informaba que Vahidi no ser\u00eda interrogado a pesar de lo previsto en el Memorando, el referente local de\nIr\u00e1n, que evidentemente contaba con informaci\u00f3n de primera mano, manifest\u00f3: \u201c...es pescado podrido, despu\u00e9s hablamos personalmente ....est\u00e1 dentro del marco es o.... se sab\u00eda.... es m\u00e1s profundo todav\u00eda... \u201d (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 12/2/2013, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009- 2013-02-12-100525-14, CD 282). Y como si todos estos indicios no fueran suficientes, el propio Canciller Salehi hizo referencia a la existencia de otros acuerdos secretos con Timerman (\u201cTehran insists accord with Argentina includes Interpol lifting red notices against Iranian suspects\u201d, Mercopress, 19/03/2013).\nLuce evidente que el compromiso de Timerman, por orden de la Sra. Presidente, fue gestionar el cese de las notificaciones rojas de Interpol, dado que se trataba del inter\u00e9s primordial de Ir\u00e1n para firmar el acuerdo. El apego a la legalidad del Organismo Internacional de Polic\u00eda Criminal frustr\u00f3 este primer objetivo delictivo de los autores de este plan de impunidad.\nCuando, por fortuna, Interpol intercedi\u00f3 a tiempo para evitar el cese de las prioridades de b\u00fasqueda, informando: \u201c...La Oficina de Asuntos Jur\u00eddicos de la Secretar\u00eda General de Interpol manifiesta que dicho acuerdo  no implica ning\u00fan tipo de cambio en el estatus de las notificaciones rojas publicadas en relaci\u00f3n a los cr\u00edmenes investigados en la causa AMIA...\u201d (Nota N\u00b0 LA/35678/47/3.1/EGI/tsa, Consejer\u00eda Jur\u00eddica, Secretar\u00eda General, Organizaci\u00f3n Internacional de Polic\u00eda Criminal, 15/03/13), el Canciller Timerman realiz\u00f3 nuevas acciones destinadas a favorecer el plan criminal y en el mes de mayo de 2013 se reuni\u00f3 con el Secretario General de Interpol, Ronald Noble, en Lyon, Francia, para lograr que Interpol tome en cuenta el acuerdo bilateral y, de tal manera, acceda a conceder la baja de las citadas prioridades de b\u00fasqueda, aunque p\u00fablicamente comunic\u00f3 lo contrario (Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto, Comunicado de Prensa N\u00b0 122/13 del 30/5/2013; Interpol, \u201cLa visita del canciller argentino a Interpol se centr\u00f3 en la colaboraci\u00f3n policial internacional\u201d, 30/05/2013).\nEn ese contexto, los representantes iran\u00edes hicieron notar su disconformidad por el fracaso en la baja de las notificaciones rojas: \u201c...hay un poquito de desaz\u00f3n de all\u00e1...

La intenci\u00f3n fue clara: informar a Noble que el Memorando de Entendimiento entre ambos pa\u00edses avanzaba fue una forma sutil e indirecta de solicitar que Interpol reviera su postura y accediera a dar de baja las notificaciones rojas de los iran\u00edes.\nSin obtener el resultado anhelado y prometido, el ministro argentino cambi\u00f3 de estrategia e intent\u00f3 convencer a los iran\u00edes de que las notificaciones rojas cesar\u00edan luego de las audiencias. Al respecto se inform\u00f3: \u201c...En di\u00e1logo con su par iran\u00ed, Javad Zarif el canciller Timerman consider\u00f3 que las circulares rojas caer\u00edan autom\u00e1ticamente en cuanto el juez que investiga el atentado, Dr. Rodolfo Canicoba Corral, les tome declaraci\u00f3n en Ir\u00e1n a los cinco acusados...'\u201d (Di Natale, Mart\u00edn, \u201cLa negociaci\u00f3n con Ir\u00e1n, empantanada por la lista de Interpol\u201d, La Naci\u00f3n 8/12/13).\nAhora bien, como qued\u00f3 claro en esta denuncia, el plan de impunidad no solo necesit\u00f3 de un camuflaje jur\u00eddico, sino tambi\u00e9n de una estrategia discursiva y medi\u00e1tica para impedir que surja a la luz su oculta\n\n\nfinalidad criminal. En este necesario ocultamiento H\u00e9ctor Timerman tambi\u00e9n desempe\u00f1\u00f3 un rol fundamental.\nEn efecto, cuando las negociaciones ya hab\u00edan tomado estado p\u00fablico, debieron extremarse los cuidados para que nada detenga la ejecuci\u00f3n del plan criminal. En ese tren de precauciones que favorecieron la comisi\u00f3n del encubrimiento aqu\u00ed denunciado, H\u00e9ctor Timerman abus\u00f3 del secreto propio que pueden gozar las tratativas diplom\u00e1ticas para ocultar los avances del plan delictual y, emiti\u00f3 comunicados desde la Canciller\u00eda Argentina, para enga\u00f1ar a la opini\u00f3n p\u00fablica sobre el contenido de las negociaciones, a fin de garantizar que nada detenga el curso criminal que estaba por culminar.\nAl inicio de dicho proceso, ambos ministerios emitieron un comunicado conjunto donde dijeron haberse comprometido a explorar mecanismos legales que no estuvieran en contradicci\u00f3n con los sistemas legales de Argentina e Ir\u00e1n (Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto, Informaci\u00f3n para la Prensa 313/12, del 27/9/12). El resultado de estas tratativas fue, justamente, el Memorando de Entendimiento, que luego ser\u00eda declarado inconstitucional por la Sala I de la Excma. C\u00e1mara en lo Criminal y Correccional Federal (CCCF, Sala I, CFP 3184/2013/CA1 \u201cAMIA s/Amparo Ley 16.986, 15/05/2014, Juzgado N\u00b06- Secretar\u00eda N\u00b0ll), lo que evidenci\u00f3 la contradicci\u00f3n con lo anunciado por el Canciller Timerman, en tanto el instrumento jur\u00eddico ha vulnerado flagrantemente el sistema legal argentino.\nEn otro comunicado, antes de suscribir el acuerdo, la cartera a cargo de Timerman afirm\u00f3: \u201c...El Gobierno Nacional ratifica que el \u00fanico compromiso es con las v\u00edctimas y el derecho de sus familiares a hallar en la verdad y en la justicia la reparaci\u00f3n debida. Argentina reafirma que en dicho objetivo no hav lugar para intereses seopol\u00edticos. ni propios, ni ajenos...\u201d (Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto, Comunicado de Prensa N\u00b0360/12, del 31/10/2012, el subrayado es propio). Justamente, como aqu\u00ed ya se ha probado holgadamente, uno de los intereses centrales de\nla maniobra criminal ha sido la voluntad de acercamiento geopol\u00edtico con Teher\u00e1n, conforme lo decidiera la Sra. Presidente.\nEst\u00e1 claro, entonces, que el canciller Timerman obr\u00f3 de mala fe para concretar el plan de impunidad y no tuvo inhibici\u00f3n alguna para realizar acciones ulteriores tendientes a favorecerlo. El dolo que lo caracteriz\u00f3 en toda esta maniobra criminal se puso de manifiesto, por ejemplo, tan s\u00f3lo dos d\u00edas despu\u00e9s de firmado el Memorando, es decir, el 29 de enero de 2013, cuando el ministro intent\u00f3 un acercamiento reuni\u00e9ndose con las entidades comunitarias jud\u00edas que hab\u00edan expresado su rechazo al pacto. En esa oportunidad, tal como lo declar\u00f3 el entonces Presidente de la AMIA, Sr. Guillermo Borger: \u201c...el canciller est\u00e1 dispuesto a generar una nota aclaratoria, una nota anexa con todos estos interrogantes y que \u00e9l mismo suscribir\u00e1...\u201d (Declaraciones de Borger a la Agencia Jud\u00eda de Noticias, \u201cBorger despu\u00e9s de la visita de Timerman a la AMIA\u201d, 29/1/13). En un comunicado oficial, AMIA plasm\u00f3 el compromiso asumido por el Canciller Timerman de confeccionar un anexo al Memorando que asegurara que las audiencias en Teher\u00e1n fueran declaraciones indagatorias conforme lo prev\u00e9 el derecho argentino, que fueran recibidas por autoridades argentinas y que el proceso previsto en el acuerdo no hiciera caer las notificaciones rojas de Interpol. AI respecto, Memoria Activa emiti\u00f3 otro comunicado dando cuenta del mismo compromiso (\u201cAMIA informa a la opini\u00f3n p\u00fablica sobre las conclusiones de la reuni\u00f3n mantenida con el canciller Timerman en el d\u00eda de ayer\u201d, Prensa Jud\u00eda, 30/01/2013; \u201cLa AMIA pide que las promesas de Timerman sean anexadas por escrito al acuerdo original\u201d, Clar\u00edn, 30 de enero de 2013; Comunicado de Memoria Activa a la opini\u00f3n p\u00fablica, del 31 de enero de 2013).\nPese a todo ello, luego de estos comunicados, el Canciller neg\u00f3 haberse comprometido con v\u00edctimas, familiares y dirigentes comunitarios a tramitar un anexo al acuerdo (\u201cLa AMIA pide al gobierno que rehaga el memor\u00e1ndum con Ir\u00e1n\u201d, La Naci\u00f3n, 1/2/2013; Capiello, Hern\u00e1n, \u201cTimerman se molest\u00f3 con la AMIA por sus exigencias\u201d, La Naci\u00f3n, 1/2/2013). En otras palabras, a pesar de lo expuesto y burdo de esta\npromesa incumplida y negada, H\u00e9ctor Timerman estaba operando para facilitar y ocultar la maniobra delictiva, a\u00fan a costo de su reputaci\u00f3n p\u00fablica.\nEn la tarea de desprestigiar a la investigaci\u00f3n judicial, H\u00e9ctor Timerman volvi\u00f3 a cumplir un papel determinante en esta fase espec\u00edfica del plan delictivo realizando aportes constantes, como en ocasi\u00f3n del tratamiento parlamentario del acuerdo, cuando se\u00f1al\u00f3: \u201c...Por primera vez hay un compromiso por escrito de Ir\u00e1n...para que la causa AMIA pueda salir de la total par\u00e1lisis en la que se encuentra\u201d, para luego agregar \u201c...proceso judicial en curso, que no ha tenido avances de ning\u00fan tipo en los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os\u201d (Versi\u00f3n taquigr\u00e1fica del Plenario de las Comisiones de Relaciones Exteriores, Asuntos Constitucionales y de Justicia y Asuntos.

Esto no puede sorprender a nadie pues ha sido a lo largo de muchos a\u00f1os, y contin\u00faa siendo a\u00fan hoy, un encendido defensor del r\u00e9gimen iran\u00ed, que ha reproducido en los medios vern\u00e1culos, la versi\u00f3n hist\u00f3ricamente sostenida por las autoridades iran\u00edes, cuestionando la acusaci\u00f3n judicial que pesa sobre sus nacionales por el atentado contra la sede de la AMIA, a quienes ha defendido p\u00fablicamente en reiteradas oportunidades.\nTiene probadas y estrechas relaciones con autoridades de la Rep\u00fablica Isl\u00e1mica de Ir\u00e1n, con quienes se contacta y ha compartido entrevistas radiales, viajes, conferencias, actos pol\u00edticos, etc. Ello sent\u00f3 las bases para que haya sido invitado a Ir\u00e1n en m\u00e1s de una ocasi\u00f3n, adem\u00e1s de haber realizado otros viajes gracias al auspicio y apoyo de sus amistades persas, como, por ejemplo, su visita a la Rep\u00fablica del L\u00edbano en 2012.

Inicialmente, D'El\u00eda relativiz\u00f3 los trascendidos de la prensa, al explicar que las suyas no eran afirmaciones categ\u00f3ricas, sino que se trataba de una mera hip\u00f3tesis elaborada en virtud de los elementos que le proveyeron en Ir\u00e1n y el consejo de sus abogados.\nLa debilidad de sus argumentos qued\u00f3 manifiesta cuando, al ser citado en declaraci\u00f3n testimonial, D\u2019El\u00eda nada pudo corroborar ni aportar elemento alguno que diera apoyo a sus especulaciones. Incluso admiti\u00f3 no haber le\u00eddo nunca el expediente y reconoci\u00f3 que sus afirmaciones no eran tales, sino meras especulaciones. De hecho, las mismas fueron desestimadas hasta por sus propios testigos.\nA fin de cuentas qued\u00f3 claramente comprobado que la versi\u00f3n brindada por D'El\u00eda no encontraba apoyo, ni siquiera, en los elementos y medidas de prueba que \u00e9l mismo hab\u00eda propuesto.

No ha de extra\u00f1ar entonces que nuevas maniobras destinadas a desvincular a los acusados iran\u00edes de las imputaciones que se les formulan en la causa por el atentado vuelvan a tener al Sr. D\u2019El\u00eda como protagonista. Es m\u00e1s, su cercan\u00eda al gobierno de Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez y sus lazos con Ir\u00e1n lo convirtieron en un personaje casi imprescindible en esta trama delictiva.

La visita tuvo por objeto participar del 31\u00b0 aniversario de la Revoluci\u00f3n Isl\u00e1mica y fue una invitaci\u00f3n del gobierno iran\u00ed, que aloj\u00f3 a toda la comitiva en la Casa de Hu\u00e9spedes de la canciller\u00eda persa (\u201cQuejas de\nIsrael por el viaje de D'Elia a Ir\u00e1n\u201d, La Naci\u00f3n, 07/03/2010; \u201cD'El\u00eda admiti\u00f3 un encuentro con un ex funcionario iran\u00ed pr\u00f3fugo en la causa AMIA\u201d, La Prensa, 07/03/2010; \u201cD\u2019El\u00eda y Esteche vieron en Ir\u00e1n a un sospechoso de volar la AMIA\u201d, Perfil, 06/03/2010).

Lo invitaron para ir adelant\u00e1ndole la soluci\u00f3n pol\u00edtica y la desvinculaci\u00f3n del tema AMIA y as\u00ed dejar de lado las acusaciones de la justicia argentina y -fundamentalmente- la baja de las notificaciones rojas, en l\u00ednea con lo hist\u00f3ricamente postulado por Teher\u00e1n.\nEn su entorno, se destacan figuras como el ex embajador venezolano en Argentina, Roger Capella. Durante su estad\u00eda en Argentina, el Embajador Roger Capella trab\u00f3 una aceitada relaci\u00f3n con distintas agrupaciones sociales argentinas, financiando a referentes como Luis D'El\u00eda y Fernando Esteche con viajes, becas y otros recursos. (Gallo, Daniel, \u201cControvertida agenda pol\u00edtica del Embajador de Venezuela\u201d, La Naci\u00f3n, 16/11/2006). Cabe recordar adem\u00e1s que Capella fue quien en noviembre de 2006 incit\u00f3 a Luis D'El\u00eda a realizar la protesta en contra de la justicia argentina por el caso AMIA, que le cost\u00f3 su espacio en el gobierno de Kirchner (\u201cKirchner orden\u00f3 expulsar a D'El\u00eda del gobierno\u201d, La Naci\u00f3n, 14/11/2006; Gallo, Daniel, \u201cControvertida agenda pol\u00edtica del Embajador de Venezuela\u201d, La Naci\u00f3n 16/11/2006).\nAhora bien, la consustanciaci\u00f3n de D'El\u00eda con el r\u00e9gimen iran\u00ed motiv\u00f3 que siguiera las pautas de la estrategia comunicacional orquestada desde Teher\u00e1n y que haya sido fuertemente cr\u00edtico con la investigaci\u00f3n llevada a cabo por las autoridades judiciales argentinas y con sus funcionarios, cuestionando su integridad y argumentando que la acusaci\u00f3n contra los nacionales iran\u00edes es falsa y ha sido inventada por intereses, presiones e interferencias de sectores y agencias norteamericanas e israel\u00edes (Ver Comunicado del 13 de noviembre de 2006, firmado por Luis D'El\u00eda y Juan Jos\u00e9 Cantiello, entregado al entonces Encargado de Negocios de Ir\u00e1n en Buenos Aires, Mohsen Baharvand; Wi\u00f1azki, Ver\u00f3nica, \u201cDesde Ir\u00e1n, D'El\u00eda asegur\u00f3 que apoyar\u00eda la pena de muerte a los responsables de la AMIA\u201d, Perfil, 4/3/2010; \u201cD'El\u00eda, m\u00e1s lejos: Ir\u00e1n no tiene nada que ver con\n\n\nMinisterio P\u00fablico de la Naci\u00f3n\nel atentado a la AMIA\u201d, Perfil, 7/3/2010; \u201cD'El\u00eda no cometi\u00f3 delito al reunirse con los iran\u00edes\u201d, Cr\u00edtica, 8/3/2010; Entrevista en el programa \u201cDATA\u201d de Rodolfo Barili, Canal Metro, 27/03/2010; \u201cCausa AMIA: Para D'El\u00eda, los acusados iran\u00edes van a ser sobrese\u00eddos\u201d, Infobae, 1/3/2013; Discurso de Luis D'El\u00eda en el Acto por el D\u00eda Internacional del Al Quds o D\u00eda Internacional de la solidaridad iran\u00ed por la liberaci\u00f3n de Palestina, Mezquita At-Tauhid, 2/8/2013; \u201cD'El\u00eda satisfecho tras el giro de Cristina con Ir\u00e1n, insiste con defender a los acusados por AMIA\u201d, La Naci\u00f3n, 26/09/2012; Dinatale, Mart\u00edn. \u201cD'El\u00eda y Esteche reivindicaron a la agrupaci\u00f3n terrorista Hezbollah\u201d, La Naci\u00f3n, 13/08/2013).\nTal postura p\u00fablica le cost\u00f3, como ya se expuso, su cargo como Subsecretario Nacional de Tierras para el H\u00e1bitat Social. En relaci\u00f3n a aquel distanciamiento, el propio D'El\u00eda declar\u00f3: \u201c...fue un momento muy duro para m\u00ed... \u201d, pero aclar\u00f3: \u201c...nunca me fui del kirchnerismo, segu\u00ed militando y acompa\u00f1ando como lo hice siempre....'\u201d (\u201cCausa AMIA: Para D'El\u00eda, los acusados iran\u00edes van a ser sobrese\u00eddos\u201d, Infobae, 1/3/2013).\nSin embargo, m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de haber dejado la funci\u00f3n p\u00fablica, D'El\u00eda sigui\u00f3 muy vinculado al gobierno, actuando desde la Federaci\u00f3n de Tierras y Viviendas. Mantuvo su cuota de poder dentro de la estructura gubernamental nacional y preserv\u00f3 sus contactos, lo que le permiti\u00f3 seguir operando. Su actividad pareci\u00f3 desplegar mayor intensidad y/o visibilidad durante el \u00faltimo mandato de Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez.\nSu injerencia en la cuesti\u00f3n de tierras y viviendas se ve corroborada, por ejemplo, en las palabras de Jorge Khalil quien, hablando con otro miembro de la comunidad iran\u00ed local, afirm\u00f3: \u201cReci\u00e9n salgo de donde Luis...le ped\u00ed hect\u00e1reas para nosotros, me las va a dar ahora...para hacer un predio para nosotros....\u201d (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 13/02/2013, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2013-02-13-124515-18, CD 283). Y en otra ocasi\u00f3n le refiri\u00f3 a D'El\u00eda: \u201c...yo ya te hab\u00eda dicho que yo fui ah\u00ed a Corrientes, a la subsecretar\u00eda, a que avances con esos... \u201d, en alusi\u00f3n a negocios previos entre ambos (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 5/3/2013, abonado 11- 3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2013-03-05-231220-24.wav, CD 303). Es\ndecir, que aun fuera de la funci\u00f3n oficial, D'El\u00eda ha seguido moviendo los hilos en la Subsecretar\u00eda Nacional de Tierras, operando y disponiendo de predios del Estado, como si continuase ejerciendo la funci\u00f3n p\u00fablica de facto.\nAl respecto, cabe recordar que en el a\u00f1o 2008 la ex Subsecretar\u00eda de Tierras para el H\u00e1bitat Social que hab\u00eda dependido de Luis D'El\u00eda en el a\u00f1o 2006, pas\u00f3 a llamarse Comisi\u00f3n Nacional de Tierras para el H\u00e1bitat Social \u201cPadre Carlos Mujica\u201d y a depender de la Jefatura de Gabinete de Ministros de Presidencia de la Naci\u00f3n (Decretos N\u00b0 172/2006 del 20/02/2006 y 341/2008 del 3/3/2008). La citada comisi\u00f3n tiene su sede en Av. Corrientes 1302 piso 2do. de la Ciudad Aut\u00f3noma de Buenos Aires y hace a\u00f1os se encuentra presidida por el Arquitecto Rub\u00e9n Pascolini quien, a su vez, y junto con la gran mayor\u00eda de los directivos de dicha comisi\u00f3n, es miembro de la asociaci\u00f3n civil \u201cFederaci\u00f3n de Tierra, Vivienda y H\u00e1bitat\u201d que preside, justamente, Luis D'El\u00eda (sitios oficiales: www.tierras.gob.ar y www.ftv.org.ar).\nResumiendo. Pocas personas pueden acreditar tantas credenciales como Luis \u00c1ngel D\u2019El\u00eda para desempe\u00f1ar el rol aqu\u00ed denunciado. Ha sido un ac\u00e9rrimo defensor del r\u00e9gimen iran\u00ed y del gobierno nacional al punto de calificarse a s\u00ed mismo como \u201cun soldado\u201d. As\u00ed lo reconoci\u00f3 el propio D'El\u00eda en una conversaci\u00f3n con Khalil, en oportunidad en la que viaj\u00f3 a Venezuela con Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez, a causa del fallecimiento de Presidente Hugo Ch\u00e1vez. En esa ocasi\u00f3n, expres\u00f3: \u201cYo me estoy yendo a Caracas temprano...Me voy con la Presidenta, Yuse...\u201d. Luego, en relaci\u00f3n a su ausencia en la conmemoraci\u00f3n por la muerte de Ch\u00e1vez, ocurrida en la Embajada Venezolana en Buenos Aires, agreg\u00f3: \u201cYo tengo que hacer el juego de la Rosada, pap\u00e1. Si tengo orden de no ir, soy un soldado ac\u00e1, \u00bfentend\u00e9s?\u201d (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 05/03/2013, abonado 11- 3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2013-03-05-231220-24.wav, CD 303). Efectivamente: un soldado, que viaja como parte de la comitiva presidencial para acompa\u00f1ar a la Sra. Presidente en su visita de condolencia por el fallecimiento de un mandatario extranjero.\nAhora bien, no puede extra\u00f1ar que, con estas credenciales y decidido el acercamiento con Teher\u00e1n -en funci\u00f3n del plan criminal aqu\u00ed expuesto-, haya desempe\u00f1ado un rol fundamental como nexo, recibiendo y enviando mensajes secretos de las autoridades argentinas a Teher\u00e1n, en distintas etapas de este sofisticado plan. Esto se verific\u00f3 cuando el acuerdo aun se estaba negociando, luego de haberse firmado el memorando, cuando \u00e9ste qued\u00f3 trabado por el desinter\u00e9s de Ir\u00e1n y cuando se mont\u00f3 una puesta en escena para simular una salida dialogada a las desaveniencias surgidas. Incluso, ha sido part\u00edcipe de las negociaciones comerciales ligadas al plan, que involucraron al imputado Mohsen Rabbani.\nNo pueden interpretarse de otro modo los constantes contactos telef\u00f3nicos y personales que ha tenido con Jorge \u201cYussuf\u2019 Khalil, un pilar de la comunidad iran\u00ed en Buenos Aires y la voz m\u00e1s alta de Ir\u00e1n en Argentina en todo lo concerniente al tema AMIA; las reuniones que ha mantenido con el Encargado de Negocios de Ir\u00e1n en Argentina; su participaci\u00f3n en la digitaci\u00f3n de las actividades de grupos locales de apoyo a Ir\u00e1n; la \u201cregulaci\u00f3n\u201d de sus apariciones y declaraci\u00f3n p\u00fablicas por parte del entorno presidencial y el asiduo contacto con el Diputado Andr\u00e9s Larroque, quien opera como su principal -aunque no \u00fanica- v\u00eda de contacto con la Sra. Presidente.\nCabe recordar que la intermediaci\u00f3n de Larroque entre Cristina y D\u2019El\u00eda qued\u00f3 evidenciada ante la opini\u00f3n p\u00fablica en general cuando se public\u00f3 que el Diputado le hab\u00eda transmitido a D'El\u00eda el siguiente mensaje: \u201cDice Cristina que no hables m\u00e1s hasta las elecciones\u201d (\u201cCristina furiosa con D'El\u00eda: No hables m\u00e1s hasta las elecciones\u201d, La Pol\u00edtica On Line, 26/9/2013). Esta informaci\u00f3n period\u00edstica se condice en un todo con los datos que surgen de las conversaciones telef\u00f3nicas registradas, en tanto corroboran que Larroque es el intermediario entre la Dra. Fern\u00e1ndez y D'El\u00eda y que a trav\u00e9s suyo ha entrado y salido la informaci\u00f3n al despacho presidencial, al menos en varios episodios relacionados con los hechos aqu\u00ed denunciados.\nEn este sentido, corresponde repetir que Luis D\u2019El\u00eda no es una persona simplemente alineada con Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez por mera afinidad en relaci\u00f3n al caso AMIA, sino que se trata de uno de sus operadores, alguien que trabaja para sus intereses, al que se le imparten instrucciones y que responde sin cuestionamientos. No se eligi\u00f3 a cualquiera como intermediario para avanzar en la negociaci\u00f3n con Ir\u00e1n, eligieron a un \u201csoldado\u201d.\nA continuaci\u00f3n, se expondr\u00e1n distintos episodios que permiten ejemplificar el rol de Luis D'El\u00eda en este entramado.\nPrimero, corresponde reiterar las palabras de Jorge Khalil en noviembre de 2012: \u201c...vengo de La Matanza reci\u00e9n he tenido una reuni\u00f3n con Luis D\u2019El\u00eda y el \u201cCuervo\u201d Larroque, el de la C\u00e1mpora...que me llamaron temprano que quer\u00edan hablar conmigo, que ten\u00edan un mensaje para el gobierno para dar...

Y al d\u00eda siguiente: \u201c...Me fui a La Matanza, estuve hablando con el Cuerno Larroque y con D'El\u00eda...de ah\u00ed me tuve que ir a la casa del embajador a hablar con el embajador para mandar un mensaje que me mandaron...\u201d (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 18/11/2012, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2012-11-18- 100116-6, CD 196).\nSegundo. El d\u00eda 27 de enero de 2013, luego de que el canciller Timerman firmara el pacto con Ir\u00e1n, el entonces Secretario General de la Presidencia, Oscar Parrilli, se comunic\u00f3 con Luis D'El\u00eda para informarle esa circunstancia y, adem\u00e1s, le pidi\u00f3 que por unos diez d\u00edas mantenga un perfil bajo y no realice declaraciones p\u00fablicas (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 27/01/13, abonado N\u00b011-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2013-01-27-174637-12, CD 266 y Comunicaci\u00f3n del 28/01/2013, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B- 1009-2013-01-28-135905-20, CD 267). Si Luis D\u2019El\u00eda no formase parte del grupo que ejecut\u00f3 el encubrimiento, esta comunicaci\u00f3n carecer\u00eda de todo\nI.BEWTO\ni ISCAL GENE\u00ediAL\nsentido pues no siendo funcionario del gobierno \u00bfcu\u00e1l ser\u00eda el motivo para informarlo al instante de la firma del acuerdo y la raz\u00f3n para pedirle que mantenga silencio?\nId\u00e9ntico pedido de \u201csilencio estrat\u00e9gico\u201d le fue comunicado por \u201cAlian\u201d, pero esa vez por intermedio de Jorge Khalil: \u201c...lo que le ten\u00e9s que decir al negro...que est\u00e9 tranquilo, 'por diez d\u00edas no coment\u00e9s nada'... \u201d.

Fern\u00e1ndez hizo llegar a D'El\u00eda su indicaci\u00f3n de \u201csilencio estrat\u00e9gico\u201d, tanto a trav\u00e9s del Secretario General como de \u201cAlian\u201d. Y resulta una terrible paradoja que las autoridades del gobierno nacional se ocupen de informar personalmente a Luis D\u2019El\u00eda de la firma del Memorando mientras que tanto los familiares y v\u00edctimas del atentado como la dirigencia comunitaria hayan tenido que anoticiarse por los medios de comunicaci\u00f3n.\nTercero. En febrero de 2013, D'El\u00eda le consigui\u00f3 al entonces Encargado de Negocios de Ir\u00e1n, Al\u00ed Pakdaman, la posibilidad de publicar una nota en la agencia oficial de noticias: \u201c...en T\u00e9lam, yo se la consegu\u00ed...\u00e9l me llam\u00f3 a m\u00ed para decirme que quer\u00eda salir en T\u00e9lam...y me llam\u00f3 Baharvandpara decirme lo mismo...\u201d, en referencia al diplom\u00e1tico iran\u00ed y anterior Encargado de Negocios apostado en Buenos Aires (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 12/02/2013, abonado 1 1-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009- 2013-02-12-185834-30, CD 282). De hecho, para articular ese pedido de la diplomacia iran\u00ed, D\u2019El\u00eda recurri\u00f3 a sus contactos en el gobierno: \u201c...yo se la consegu\u00ed, yo habl\u00e9 con Rodra y el Cuervo...\u201d, en alusi\u00f3n al entonces Subsecretario de Medios Rodrigo Rodr\u00edguez y al Diputado Nacional Andr\u00e9s Larroque (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 12/02/2013, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2013-02-12-185834-30, CD 282).\nEste tipo de episodios demuestran, una vez m\u00e1s, que las acciones de Luis D'El\u00eda se encuentran destinadas a responder y atender a los intereses iran\u00edes, en cumplimiento de las directivas emanadas de Presidencia de la Naci\u00f3n.\nCuarto. En el acto del D\u00eda de Al Quds, Luis D'El\u00eda reivindic\u00f3 a Hezbollah y se jact\u00f3 de sus contactos con la organizaci\u00f3n terrorista acusada de ejecutar el atentado contra la sede de la AMIA (Dinatale, Mart\u00edn, \u201cD'El\u00eda y Esteche reivindicaron a la agrupaci\u00f3n terrorista Hezbollah\u201d, La Naci\u00f3n, 13/08/2013). Al elogiar a la organizaci\u00f3n terrorista libanesa, hizo referencia a su reciente viaje a la Rep\u00fablica del L\u00edbano en marzo de 2012, donde visit\u00f3 sitios propios de la organizaci\u00f3n y estuvo en contacto sus dirigentes (Discurso de Luis D'El\u00eda en el Acto por el D\u00eda Internacional de Al Quds, Mezquita At-Tauhid, 02/08/2013).\nSeg\u00fan la informaci\u00f3n disponible, este viaje habr\u00eda sido solventado por la organizaci\u00f3n \u201cFree Palestin\u00e9\u2019 (\u201cLuis D'El\u00eda desde Beirut, acompa\u00f1a la Marcha Mundial a Jerusal\u00e9n por Palestina.

Recibi\u00f3 instrucciones de parte de Andr\u00e9s Larroque. Se comunic\u00f3 innumerables veces con el interlocutor del r\u00e9gimen iran\u00ed, Jorge Khalil, contact\u00f3 al representante diplom\u00e1tico de Ir\u00e1n y abog\u00f3 p\u00fablicamente por la buena marcha del plan.

En ese car\u00e1cter ha sido el nexo central en la vinculaci\u00f3n entre autoridades iran\u00edes y argentinas en el marco del accionar delictivo aqu\u00ed denunciado. De hecho, en todo aquello\nrelacionado con el plan de encubrimiento, Khalil ha contado con mucho m\u00e1s peso espec\u00edfico que los diplom\u00e1ticos persas aqu\u00ed apostados. Es decir, Jorge \u201cYussuf\u2019 Khalil responde al r\u00e9gimen y ha actuado en todo momento conforme las directivas de Teher\u00e1n. Ha sido la voz y los o\u00eddos de Ir\u00e1n en Argentina, ha transmitido los mensajes de sus autoridades y ha defendido los intereses iran\u00edes ante los operadores locales y, al mismo tiempo, ha retransmitido las inquietudes y demandas de las autoridades argentinas a sus superiores en Ir\u00e1n.\nKhalil siempre fue consciente de su posici\u00f3n y la explic\u00f3 manifestando: \u201cyo soy org\u00e1nico le dije...a m\u00ed me dieron la orden de all\u00e1, no tengo que mover un dedo...no muevo un dedo\u201d en alusi\u00f3n a que obedece enteramente a las indicaciones y directivas que recibe de Teher\u00e1n (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 6/6/13, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013- 06-06-092046-14, CD 48).

En otra ocasi\u00f3n se defini\u00f3 como el nexo entre funcionarios argentinos y la Embajada de Ir\u00e1n, al aclarar: \u201cyo no estoy operando para ellos, yo estoy operando para los nuestros, para lo que es la embajada...ellos me mandaron a hacer una cosa, yo como soy el nexo...\u201d, en clara referencia a Ir\u00e1n (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 18/11/2012, abonado 11-3315- 6908, Archivo B-1009-2012-11 -18-100116-6, CD 196).\nPor si queda alguna duda sobre la importancia de Khalil como referente y nexo local para Teher\u00e1n, en especial para este plan de impunidad, \u00e9l mismo demostr\u00f3 su manejo y aclar\u00f3 que no le importaba lo que dijera el entonces Encargado de Negocios de Ir\u00e1n en Argentina, m\u00e1xima autoridad diplom\u00e1tica iran\u00ed en el pa\u00eds, Ali Pakdaman.

Al respecto, ha dicho: \u201cBaha sabe c\u00f3mo me muevo y todo...qu\u00e9 lugares frecuento, \u00e9l sabe todo, yo le cuento, le cont\u00e9 todo a \u00e9l siempre\u201d, en contraposici\u00f3n con la postura que asumi\u00f3 con uno de sus sucesores, Ali Pakdaman, sobre quien expres\u00f3: \u201c...yo no se lo voy a decir al Safir, porque el Safir va y lo vende...\u201d (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 4/11/12, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2012-11-04-130024-6, CD 182).\nA d\u00edas de firmarse el acuerdo con Ir\u00e1n, Pakdaman lo convoc\u00f3 para decirle: \u201c...usted tiene que ir a Ir\u00e1n porque Baharvand le quiere informar c\u00f3mo van las cosas, c\u00f3mo van a seguir...y aparte el sheik  va a decir delante de todos que todos lo sigan a usted...\u201d, lo que demuestra tanto su estrecha vinculaci\u00f3n con la diplomacia iran\u00ed como -fundamentalmente- la confianza y cercan\u00eda con el imputado Mohsen Rabbani (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 14/02/2013, abonado 1 1-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2013-02-14-164341 -10, CD 284).\nPero m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de ciertas tensiones, queda claro que Khalil es aut\u00f3nomo y con poder propio respecto de la diplomacia formal iran\u00ed, a la cual elude seg\u00fan sus instrucciones, \u201c....yo lo puente\u00e9 porque a m\u00ed me dijeron que yo tengo que hacer las cosas y bueno...las hago.

Todo lo expuesto corrobora que en las citadas tratativas, Khalil ha participado, representando y operando por Mohsen Rabbani, pero -fundamentalmente- como referente del r\u00e9gimen de Teher\u00e1n.\nPor otra parte, Jorge Khalil ha tenido una participaci\u00f3n clave en el armado de la pista falsa para desviar la investigaci\u00f3n judicial del caso AMIA y desvincular definitivamente a los imputados iran\u00edes. En ese sentido, fue quien se mantuvo en contacto telef\u00f3nico constante con \u201cAlian\u201d, agente de la Secretar\u00eda de Inteligencia encargado de elaborar la nueva hip\u00f3tesis. Y mucho antes de firmarse el acuerdo, Khalil ya trabajaba en el tema, junto con Fernando Esteche, quien tambi\u00e9n aport\u00f3 ideas para fabricar la versi\u00f3n alternativa que explique el atentado. En los \u00faltimos meses del a\u00f1o 2012, Esteche hab\u00eda sugerido la incorporaci\u00f3n al plan del ex fiscal designado para actuar en la causa AMIA, H\u00e9ctor Yrimia, con quien - siguiendo esta recomendaci\u00f3n- se empez\u00f3 a reunir Jorge Khalil en noviembre de 2012. Sumar a Yrimia tuvo por fin que la versi\u00f3n construida resulte veros\u00edmil y permita con mayor efectividad el deslinde de los iran\u00edes.\nSab\u00eda perfectamente, para ello hab\u00eda trabajado, que vendr\u00eda \u201cotra hip\u00f3tesis, con otras pruebas \u201d, que se pretend\u00eda descolocar al suscripto y ridiculizar a la actual investigaci\u00f3n del caso usando pruebas desconocidas para el expediente judicial; y que la \u201cComisi\u00f3n de la Verdad\u201d no hab\u00eda sido creada para investigar, sino que estaba destinada -justamente- a desvincular a los iran\u00edes:\u201c...alguien va a salir...con la cara manchada de ac\u00e1...Obvio, eso ya est\u00e1 arreglado... \u00bfC\u00f3mo va a ser para el lado nuestro, boludo?

Esto significa que, la participaci\u00f3n y conocimiento que de los hechos ha tenido Khalil no solo fundan la imputaci\u00f3n en su contra, sino que tambi\u00e9n han permitido al suscripto obtener la informaci\u00f3n suficiente como para revelar y comprobar el plan de impunidad ejecutado.\nResumiendo. Jorge \u201cYussuf\u2019 Khalil ha sido una pieza de importancia fundamental en la ejecuci\u00f3n del plan criminal de encubrimiento perge\u00f1ado por las m\u00e1s altas autoridades del gobierno argentino. Se trata del referente pol\u00edtico local del gobierno de Ir\u00e1n, completamente consustanciado con las ideas y la pol\u00edtica del r\u00e9gimen. Militante a tiempo completo de los intereses persas ha sido el clandestino interlocutor iran\u00ed en Buenos Aires para cumplir con el iter criminis de la impunidad. Al no tener una funci\u00f3n oficial, su figura ha encajado a la perfecci\u00f3n en esa tarea, oficiando de canal de comunicaci\u00f3n para recibir y entregar los mensajes secretos y clandestinos que se enviaron encubridores y encubiertos.\nPor lo dem\u00e1s, motoriz\u00f3 la finalidad mediata del encubrimiento, esto es, el intercambio comercial a nivel estatal entre Argentina e Ir\u00e1n. En esa l\u00ednea tendi\u00f3 numerosos puentes entre agentes gubernamentales y operadores iran\u00edes, el m\u00e1s importante de los cuales puede resumirse en el inter\u00e9s de intercambiar \u201cpetr\u00f3leo por granos\u201d comunicado por parte del Ministro Julio De Vido, en cumplimiento de \u00f3rdenes emanadas de Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nALBERTO N!SM<\u00edrg Ministerio P\u00fablico de la Naci\u00f3n\tfiscal general./\nAsimismo y como ya se se\u00f1al\u00f3, particip\u00f3 del armado de la hip\u00f3tesis alternativa y su aporte result\u00f3 fundamental en la buena marcha del plan de encubrimiento.\ne)\t\"Alian \u201d, miembro de la Secretar\u00eda de Inteligencia. respecto de quien hay fuertes indicios que su nombre verdadero ser\u00eda Ram\u00f3n Alian H\u00e9ctor Bogado.\nEn la ejecuci\u00f3n del plan criminal, la persona identificada como \u201cAlian\u201d cumpli\u00f3 un rol imprescindible. En su condici\u00f3n de funcionario de la Secretar\u00eda de Inteligencia, con llegada directa al entorno presidencial, ha sido un actor clave en la interacci\u00f3n entre las altas figuras gubernamentales involucradas en los hechos. Es decir, ha sido especialmente seleccionado para instrumentar, materializar y llevar adelante los designios criminales de la Sra. Presidente y del Sr. Canciller.\nEn primer lugar, corresponde dejar aclarado que \u201cAlian\u201d podr\u00eda tratarse del Sr. Ram\u00f3n Alian H\u00e9ctor Bogado. Sin haberse realizado medidas probatorias intrusivas que permitan develar esta cuesti\u00f3n, por considerar que las mismas corresponden a las autoridades judiciales que intervengan en la denuncia que aqu\u00ed se radica, se pudo obtener la siguiente informaci\u00f3n:\n\n2)\tEn la red social \u201cS\u00f3nico\u201d fue posible hallar una titularidad de cuenta que coincide con el encabezamiento de la direcci\u00f3n de mail \u201callanbogad\u201d, igual a la que envi\u00f3 \u201cAlian\u201d a Khalil (se adjuntan impresiones correspondientes a la cuenta \u201callanbogad\u201d en red social \u201cS\u00f3nico\u201d).\n3)\tDe una comunicaci\u00f3n telef\u00f3nica surge que \u201cAlian\u201d ser\u00eda oriundo de la Provincia de Misiones. En efecto, en referencia al Senador Nacional por Misiones, Juan Manuel Irraz\u00e1bal, Khalil le dijo a \u201cAlian\u201d: \u201cte vas a llevar bien con \u00e9l porque es de tu provincia\u201d (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 5/12/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-12-05-192539-18, CD 230).\n4)\tEn publicaciones necrol\u00f3gicas de un peri\u00f3dico de la Provincia de Misiones, que comunica el deceso de \u201cAlian H\u00e9ctor Bogado\u201d -quien falleciera, seg\u00fan los datos obtenidos, a los 78 a\u00f1os de edad-, se identifican a varios de sus familiares y allegados. Su nombre, casi hom\u00f3nimo de la persona de inter\u00e9s en esta pesquisa, permite presumir -a priori- cierta vinculaci\u00f3n familiar entre ambos, reforzando la hip\u00f3tesis que el contacto de Khalil, \u201cAlian\u201d de Misiones, podr\u00eda ser \u201cRam\u00f3n H\u00e9ctor Alian Bogado\u201d (se adjuntan impresiones de los avisos necrol\u00f3gicos del diario \u201cEl Territorio\u201d publicados en 29 y 30 de agosto de 2013).\n5)\tEn el mismo peri\u00f3dico misionero se observan fotograf\u00edas que ilustran a un hombre de mediana edad, a quien se identifica como \u201cAlian Bogado\u201d. En la fotograf\u00eda se encuentra acompa\u00f1ado de otras personas, cuyos nombres coinciden con algunos de los contactos de la cuenta \u201callanbogad\u201d de la red social \u201cS\u00f3nico\u201d y con varios de los deudos del fallecido \u201cAlian H\u00e9ctor Bogado\u201d (\u201cMirando el r\u00edo\u201d, El Territorio, versi\u00f3n digital, del 6/02/2006).\nEn base a todos estos indicios es dable sospechar que \u201cRam\u00f3n Alian H\u00e9ctor Bogado\u201d podr\u00eda ser la identidad del contacto de Khalil nombrado en las comunicaciones telef\u00f3nicas como \u201cAlian\u201d, sin perjuicio de lo cual, naturalmente, se trata de una circunstancia m\u00e1s a ser corroborada por el magistrado interviniente en el marco de los hechos aqu\u00ed denunciados.\nM\u00e1s all\u00e1 de la correcta identificaci\u00f3n de este sujeto, lo cierto es que se trata de un miembro de la Secretar\u00eda de Inteligencia que se ha pronunciado y ha actuado, en reiteradas ocasiones, a favor de intereses extranjeros en detrimento de los nacionales. Que ha transmitido informaciones secretas y protegidas por la ley de inteligencia a agentes de una potencia extranjera. Que ha trabajado y negociado la impunidad de los pr\u00f3fugos de la causa AMIA. En ese rol no hesit\u00f3 en transmitir informaci\u00f3n sensible y clasificada a la contraparte iran\u00ed. Tampoco dud\u00f3 en contribuir al armado de una \u201cpista falsa\u201d con pruebas falsas ni en conspirar contra las autoridades judiciales a cargo de la investigaci\u00f3n y, menos a\u00fan, en utilizar\nlos resortes del estado nacional para establecer buenas relaciones con la comunidad iran\u00ed, articularle favores y allanar cualquier obst\u00e1culo que surgiera durante la ejecuci\u00f3n del plan de encubrimiento. El hecho de que lo haya efectuado cumpliendo \u00f3rdenes superiores en nada lo exculpa.\nProfundizando lo afirmado, en primer lugar corresponde hacer notar que los elementos colectados indican que \u201cAlian\u201d trabaja para la Secretar\u00eda de Inteligencia. Su pertenencia a dicho organismo queda fuera de discusi\u00f3n por su propia confesi\u00f3n y por la informaci\u00f3n que maneja. Pr\u00e9stese atenci\u00f3n a la siguiente conversaci\u00f3n entre \u201cAlian\u201d y Khalil, mantenida el 2 de junio de 2013.\nKhalil: Dos cositas... \u00bfc\u00f3mo ves el cambio que hubo en el gobierno?

Fern\u00e1ndez hab\u00eda concurrido a la Fundaci\u00f3n Favaloro para realizarse un estudio cardiovascular por una arritmia, con un cuadro de cefalea. Scoccimarro dijo que la Sra.

Presidente, de las circunstancias en que el cuadro cl\u00ednico fue detectado, de su sintomatolog\u00eda inicial y del tratamiento m\u00e9dico que recibi\u00f3 Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez antes de ser trasladada al sanatorio.\nEs decir, \u201cAlian\u201d pose\u00eda informaci\u00f3n privilegiada y ver\u00eddica de la salud de la primera mandataria, que en ese momento no era p\u00fablica. Y la pose\u00eda en detalle, adem\u00e1s de actualizada. Es decir, como se dijo y se prob\u00f3, pertenece al entorno m\u00e1s cercano a la presidente.\nEsta pertenencia es l\u00f3gica si se analiza su actuaci\u00f3n en el plan criminal. De lo contrario, nunca se le hubiera encargado una tarea en extremo sensible: ejecutar una acci\u00f3n delictiva por directa orden de la Sra. Presidente.\nEn efecto, su accionar abarc\u00f3 varios aspectos del plan de encubrimiento. En primer lugar actu\u00f3 como nexo entre las autoridades del gobierno nacional involucradas en el plan de encubrimiento y los canales paralelos de comunicaci\u00f3n.\nEn ese sentido, no sorprende que sea \u201cAlian\u201d quien, apenas suscripto el tratado con Ir\u00e1n, se haya comunicado con Jorge \u201cYussuf\u2019 Khalil para pedirle que le transmita a Luis D'El\u00eda un mensaje directo de Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez: Que no hable por 10 d\u00edas.\n\u201cAlian\u201d: ...lo que le tenes que decir al negro....que est\u00e9 tranquilo, por diez d\u00edas no comentes nada.\nKhalil: Ahora lo llamo\n(Comunicaci\u00f3n del 28/01/13, abonado 11-315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2013-\n1\t-28-135732-18.wav, CD 267).\nInmediatamente, Khalil se comunic\u00f3 con Luis D\u2019El\u00eda y le pas\u00f3\nel mensaje.\nKhalil: Esc\u00fachame eh...por las dudas que te llamen hoy los medios o alguno, ten\u00e9 perfil bajo, por 10 d\u00edas por lo menos.\nD\u2019El\u00eda: Bueno.\nKhalil: Yo s\u00e9 por qu\u00e9 te lo digo...\nD\u2019El\u00eda: B\u00e1rbaro....me dijo Parrilli reci\u00e9n tambi\u00e9n.\n(Comunicaci\u00f3n del 28/01/2013, abonado 1 1-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009- 2013-01-28-135905-20, CD 267)\nEl pedido en s\u00ed mismo no es importante. S\u00ed lo es la comprobaci\u00f3n de que \u201cAlian\u201d cumple \u00f3rdenes directamente emanadas de la Presidente. Esto se evidencia por el hecho de pedir exactamente lo mismo que el exSecretario General de la Presidencia, Oscar Parrilli, pero por otros canales. Es decir, la orden fue: Que D\u2019El\u00eda no hable. La transmiten tanto Parrilli como \u201cAlian\u201d. El hecho de comunicar id\u00e9nticas directivas estrat\u00e9gicas revela una misma fuente que, aqu\u00ed todo indica, se trata de la Dra. Fern\u00e1ndez, lo que no hace m\u00e1s que corroborar la posici\u00f3n de \u201cAlian\u201d en el entorno presidencial.\nEn otra comunicaci\u00f3n con Jorge \u201cYussuf\u201d Khalil, del 6 de febrero de 2013, en relaci\u00f3n a la entonces reciente firma del Memorando de Entendimiento, \u201cAlian\u201d dijo: \u201c...estamos muy bien y hay que laburar tranquilos ...tenemos que hacer un trabajo de ac\u00e1 a 10 a\u00f1os, \u00bfme entend\u00e9s?

Para congraciarse con la parte iran\u00ed, \u201cAlian\u201d le ha ido abriendo puertas de importantes oficinas del gobierno. En ese tren de \u201cfavores\u201d a los iran\u00edes, le consigui\u00f3 a Khalil una reuni\u00f3n con Ricardo Echegaray, titular de la Administraci\u00f3n Federal de Ingresos P\u00fablicos (AFIP) por un tema relacionado a unos seguros de cauci\u00f3n. De hecho, cuando Khalil le pidi\u00f3 a \u201cAlian\u201d este contacto, aquel le respondi\u00f3: \u201c...no hay problema...te ven\u00eds conmigo...\u201d (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 13/06/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-06-13-213124- 24, CD 55).\nTambi\u00e9n Khalil le ha pedido favores para sus contactos en la Aduana (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 24/05/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-05-24-175330-20.txt, CD 35).

Una prueba m\u00e1s de la cercan\u00eda entre quienes llevaron adelante la maniobra encubridora.\nAdem\u00e1s, cuando se firm\u00f3 finalmente el acuerdo, \u201cAlian\u201d le dijo a Khalil: \u201c ...Tranquilo, ya ganamos, es decir, ganamos una partida, yo te dije, vos no me ten\u00edas fe...\u201d, identific\u00e1ndose a s\u00ed mismo y a su interlocutor, como integrantes de una misma parte del acuerdo, como part\u00edcipes de un mismo inter\u00e9s que, hoy ya se sabe, era m\u00e1s que eso, era un plan delictivo para brindar impunidad (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 28/01/13, abonado 11-315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2013-01-28-135732-18.wav, CD 267).\nEl alineamiento con los acusados iran\u00edes tambi\u00e9n se trasluce en sus propias palabras, dado que hasta ha llegado a calificarlos de \u201camigos\u201d (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 25/2/13, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2013- 02-25-151137-12, CD 295).\n\u201cAlian\u201d, en incontables oportunidades documentadas, le ha proporcionado a un operador del r\u00e9gimen iran\u00ed como Jorge Khalil, que tiene directa y fluida relaci\u00f3n con el imputado Mohsen Rabbani, informaci\u00f3n pol\u00edtica del gobierno de Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez que no es p\u00fablica. Esto tambi\u00e9n revela el enorme grado de confianza que \u201cAlian\u201d ha depositado en Jorge Khalil.\nEn una ocasi\u00f3n, Khalil solicit\u00f3 que le chequee ciertas cuestiones, por ejemplo, le dijo:\t\u201c...tengo\tuna reuni\u00f3n con una persona...que dice ser amigo y, la verdad, necesito chequear algunas cosas...'\u2019'\u2019 (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 22/11/2012, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2012-11-22-121757-24, CD 200). Este tipo de pedidos constituyen nuevas comprobaciones sobre la vinculaci\u00f3n entre \u201cAlian\u201d y la inteligencia.\nCuando Khalil le pide a \u201cAlian\u201d que le chequee informaci\u00f3n sobre tal cuesti\u00f3n o persona, es como si el propio Mohsen Rabbani -a quien Khalil responde y con quien habla peri\u00f3dicamente- est\u00e9 utilizando los servicios de inteligencia del estado para sus necesidades e intereses.\nAdem\u00e1s, este sujeto le relat\u00f3 al agente de Ir\u00e1n, Jorge Khalil, que hab\u00eda estado en Suiza un mes antes de que se suscribiera el acuerdo en Africa, para trabajar en el mismo: \u201c...todo lo que laburamos en esto...vos sab\u00e9s que yo hace un mes estuve all\u00e1 en Ginebra...\u201d (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 28/01/13, abonado 11-315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2013-01-28-135732- 18.wav, CD 267). La intervenci\u00f3n de \u201cAlian\u201d luce evidente.\nOtro aporte fundamental de \u201cAlian\u201d a la ejecuci\u00f3n del plan criminal remite a la construcci\u00f3n de la nueva hip\u00f3tesis delictiva para la causa AMIA que desplace a las acusaciones alzadas por la justicia nacional contra los iran\u00edes.\nEn ese sentido, \u201cAlian\u201d expres\u00f3: \u201c...ya estamos en otro pa\u00eds, es otra situaci\u00f3n mundial y hay que trabajar en otro contexto... \u201d, y este \u201ctrabajar en otro contexto\u201d implicaba que la prioridad era un acercamiento geopol\u00edtico a Ir\u00e1n, que impon\u00eda dejar de lado las acusaciones contra funcionarios de dichos pa\u00eds (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 01/06/2013, abonado 11- 3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-06-01-224726-18, CD43).\nCon ese fin, le comunic\u00f3 al agente de Ir\u00e1n: \u201c...\u00e9l sabe lo que va a venir, que va a venir otra hip\u00f3tesis, con otras pruebas y a hacer culo al norte porque nunca las vio \u00e9l las pruebas, \u00bfme entendiste hermano?... \u201d, est\u00e1 hablando del suscripto (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 01/06/2013, abonado 11- 3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-06-01 -224726-18, CD 43).\nEn pocas palabras, este sujeto, con una posici\u00f3n estrat\u00e9gica dentro del gobierno nacional, le comunic\u00f3 a un agente que opera para una\npotencia extranjera, que se van a presentar pruebas falsas para alterar ilegalmente el curso de una causa judicial, deslegitimar a los actuales investigadores y encubrir a los imputados y esa informaci\u00f3n fue enviada a un acusado y pr\u00f3fugo de la justicia argentina.\nCabe destacar la gravedad de las acciones realizadas por \u201cAlian\u201d en este entramado, porque desde su posici\u00f3n en el gobierno nacional proporcion\u00f3 datos que no son p\u00fablicos, incluida informaci\u00f3n de la causa, del suscripto y del acuerdo, a un representante org\u00e1nico de Ir\u00e1n - Jorge \u201cYussuf\u2019 Khalil-, quien luego se los comunic\u00f3 a varias personas, entre ellos, a Mohsen Rabbani, uno de los acusados de terrorismo por la justicia argentina y con notificaci\u00f3n roja emitida por Interpol.\nAl mismo tiempo, la Sra. Presidente y el Sr. Canciller, haciendo gala de sus habilidades para tergiversar la realidad proclamaban que el \u00fanico inter\u00e9s que los mov\u00eda era destrabar la causa y que solo buscaban verdad y justicia. Vaya paradoja.\nPor \u00faltimo, podr\u00eda resultar llamativo que \u201cAlian\u201d no haya considerado necesario actuar en forma encubierta. Ello solo puede deberse a la circunstancia, como ya se demostr\u00f3, de que estaba actuando por \u00f3rdenes superiores. Sus contactos de Ir\u00e1n sab\u00edan perfectamente a quienes respond\u00eda y en qu\u00e9 \u00e1mbito se desempe\u00f1aba, \u00e9l mismo ha admitido que la informaci\u00f3n que ha manejado proven\u00eda de donde trabajaba, la Secretar\u00eda de Inteligencia, y as\u00ed ha transmitido informaci\u00f3n reservada sin necesidad de encubrir su identidad o su actividad, con la tranquilidad propia de quien cumple \u00f3rdenes y no de quien viola secretos y pone en peligro su fuente de trabajo.\nY\tadem\u00e1s de proveer informaci\u00f3n secreta y reservada a los contactos locales iran\u00edes, \u201cAlian\u201d ha transmitido tranquilidad en distintos momentos del despliegue encubridor. As\u00ed, por ejemplo, cuando se hizo p\u00fablico el nuevo pronunciamiento emitido por esta Unidad Fiscal el 29 de mayo de 2013, en la que se presentaron nuevas pruebas que profundizaban la implicaci\u00f3n de los acusados iran\u00edes en el atentado, le dijo a Khalil en referencia a tal dictamen: \u201c ...Queda ah\u00ed...cuando llega al juez para arriba, \u00bfc\u00f3mo va a hacer?\u201d (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 31/05/2013, abonado 11-3238- 4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-05-31-095657-14, CD 42), dejando entrever que estaba todo controlado, que nada iba a pasar con ese dictamen fiscal, porque la decisi\u00f3n \u00faltima depende de las distintas instancias del Poder Judicial y no de lo que demuestre o sostenga el Ministerio P\u00fablico Fiscal.\nDe este modo manten\u00eda la tranquilidad y los buenos v\u00ednculos con los referentes de Teher\u00e1n en Buenos Aires, a quienes deb\u00eda contener y asistir, con el fin \u00faltimo de sostener la \u201cpr\u00f3spera\u201d relaci\u00f3n con el r\u00e9gimen iran\u00ed y as\u00ed facilitar el avance del plan criminal.\nEn conclusi\u00f3n, existen fundados elementos para aseverar que los autores de este plan criminal han puesto a una persona allegada al poder de la Secretar\u00eda de Inteligencia, de la confianza de la Sra. Presidente, para colaborar con la actividad de los iran\u00edes en paralelo a la implementaci\u00f3n de la maniobra de encubrimiento. Y, a trav\u00e9s de esta persona -que no es otra que \u201cAlian\u201d- han abierto las puertas de las estructuras del estado para que los representantes locales de Teher\u00e1n puedan utilizar resortes y contactos, en su favor.\nSe est\u00e1 en presencia de uno de los sujetos de los que se valieron los encubridores para llevar adelante el plan criminal. Est\u00e1 claro que \u201cAlian\u201d ha sido cuidadosamente seleccionado. Por ser tener acceso al entorno presidencial, por responder a la Secretar\u00eda de Inteligencia, por su declarada simpat\u00eda con el r\u00e9gimen iran\u00ed, por ser un contacto directo y asiduo de Jorge \u201cYussuf\u2019 Khalil, por su dedicaci\u00f3n, obediencia y, sobre todo, por su falta de escr\u00fapulos a la hora de manipular pruebas, personas e inventar hip\u00f3tesis falsas para lograr la consecuci\u00f3n del encubrimiento.\nd)\tFemando Luis Esteche\nFernando Esteche es el l\u00edder de la agrupaci\u00f3n \u201cQuebracho\u201d y desde anta\u00f1o, ha expresado una clara postura en contra a la acusaci\u00f3n a los iran\u00edes por el caso AMIA.\nA su vez, la cercana vinculaci\u00f3n entre miembros del grupo \u201cQuebracho\u201d y funcionarios y ex funcionarios del gobierno de Cristina\n\n\nMinisterio P\u00fablico de la Naci\u00f3n\nFern\u00e1ndez, ha sido expuesta a la opini\u00f3n p\u00fablica. De hecho, se calific\u00f3 a \u201cQuebracho\u201d como un \u201cadherente al oficialismo\u201d (Morales Sol\u00e1, Joaqu\u00edn, \u201cLas dos miradas de EEUU\u201d, La Naci\u00f3n, 23/02/2014). Y se dijo que a pesar de la detenci\u00f3n de Esteche, esta agrupaci\u00f3n hab\u00eda mantenido \u201c...v\u00ednculos informales con los K...\u201d (Van Der Kooy, Eduardo, \u201cEl activismo de Quebracho ocupa el vac\u00edo callejero que dejaron los K\u201d, Clar\u00edn, 20/02/2014). En julio de 2011 se conocieron datos que denunciaban que Luis D'El\u00eda y la agrupaci\u00f3n Quebracho, entre otras, estaban recibiendo apoyo pol\u00edtico y hasta financiero del gobierno iran\u00ed (Dinatale, Mart\u00edn, \u201cPreocupan v\u00ednculos con D'El\u00eda y Quebracho\u201d, La Naci\u00f3n, 18/7/11).\nPara comprender la participaci\u00f3n de Femando Esteche en este plan de encubrimiento, se debe tener presente que tambi\u00e9n se encuentra vinculado al imputado Mohsen Rabbani, al Diputado Andr\u00e9s Larroque y mantiene fluidos contactos con Jorge \u201cYussuf\u2019 Khalil.\nEn efecto, ha viajado a la Rep\u00fablica Isl\u00e1mica de Ir\u00e1n a fines de febrero y principios de marzo de 2010, junto a los imputados Luis D\u2019El\u00eda y Jorge Khalil, ocasi\u00f3n en la que particip\u00f3 del 31\u00b0 aniversario de la Revoluci\u00f3n Isl\u00e1mica y oportunidad en la que tuvo contacto personal con Mohsen Rabbani (\u201cD\u2019El\u00eda y Esteche vieron en Ir\u00e1n a un sospechoso de volar la AMIA\u201d, Perfil, 6/3/2010).\nPor otra parte, su relaci\u00f3n con el Diputado Nacional Andr\u00e9s Larroque es un hecho. Esteche mismo lo ha reconocido: \u201c...hoy lo tengo que ver, si, hoy vengo a Capital a verlo a \u00e9l...\u201d, en alusi\u00f3n al Diputado Larroque (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 19/11/2012, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2012-11-19-121034-16, CD 197). Tan es as\u00ed, que en funci\u00f3n del v\u00ednculo existente entre Esteche y Larroque, Khalil le ha pedido que lo ayude a construir una relaci\u00f3n directa con el diputado (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 20/11/2012, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2012-11 -20-131705- 12, CD 198).\nAhora bien, se trata del sujeto que ha viabilizado o hecho posible el avance del plan de encubrimiento mediante, al menos, dos conductas concretas. Primera, posibilit\u00f3 la vinculaci\u00f3n del agente iran\u00ed en\nBuenos Aires, Jorge Khalil, con funcionarios del gobierno argentino. Espec\u00edficamente lo ha contactado con los operadores de la Secretaria de Inteligencia, el sujeto apodado \u201cAlian\u201d y el Dr. H\u00e9ctor Luis Yrimia, quienes han participado, entre otras cuestiones, del armado de la falsa hip\u00f3tesis que deb\u00eda desplazar a la que involucra a los iran\u00edes encubiertos.\nEn efecto, Jorge \u201cYussuf\u2019 Khalil reconoci\u00f3 expresamente que se ha sentado a la mesa con los funcionarios de la Secretar\u00eda de Inteligencia para trabajar en el avance del plan encubridor gracias a la gesti\u00f3n de Esteche (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 4/11/12, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B- 1009-2012-11 -04-130024-6, CD 182).\nSegunda. Esteche, personalmente, ha contribuido con ideas espec\u00edficas para la construcci\u00f3n de la nueva y falsa hip\u00f3tesis del gobierno de Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez para el atentado del 18 de julio de 1994. V\u00e9ase lo que expresaba en diciembre de 2012 acerca de los pasos que se deb\u00edan tomar en relaci\u00f3n al encubrimiento: \u201c...el nuevo responsable de AMIA, por ejemplo, es una necesidad que tienen que construirla, van a querer ir construyendo el consenso de esto...no van a poder decir que fueron los israel\u00edes... \u201d, sugiriendo que pod\u00edan atribuirle el hecho a \u201c...una conexi\u00f3n de fachos locales...\u201d (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 18/12/2012, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2012-12-18-183332-8, CD 226). Y aportando una idea concreta, agreg\u00f3: \u201c...El Fiscal de AMIA es de ellos, Yrimia, que lo echaron del caso AMIA, \u00e9l te puede...generar informaci\u00f3n, quiero que me den informaci\u00f3n del caso AMIA, \u00bfse puede o no se puede? \u00bfQu\u00e9 est\u00e1n dispuestos a aportar?..?'\u2019 (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 18/12/2012, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2012-12-18-183332-8, CD 226).\nHa sido precisamente Esteche quien contact\u00f3 al Dr. H\u00e9ctor Luis Yrimia y lo conect\u00f3 con el referente local de Ir\u00e1n en el pa\u00eds, Jorge Khalil, para que le brinde informaci\u00f3n de la causa judicial a los fines de contribuir a fabricar, con cierto grado de credibilidad en virtud de los datos aportados, una nueva hip\u00f3tesis sobre el atentado, con otros imputados. En efecto, en una conversaci\u00f3n Khalil coment\u00f3 que estuvo reunido por dos horas con \u201cel ex juez y ex fiscal de la causa AMIA, Yrimia\u201d y que el\ncontacto ven\u00eda de parte de conocidos de Esteche (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 19/1/14, abonado 11-3964-0799, Archivo IN-12177-20140119-003044, CD 49).\nRecu\u00e9rdese que, al momento del atentado, Yrimia era Fiscal de Primera Instancia en lo Criminal y Correccional Federal a cargo de la Fiscal\u00eda N\u00b06 y fue designado el mismo d\u00eda del hecho para colaborar con la investigaci\u00f3n, en car\u00e1cter conjunto, alterno o sucesivo respecto de otros fiscales tambi\u00e9n nombrados a esos efectos, lo que le franque\u00f3 el acceso al expediente en sus primeros tiempos. Este es un aporte central del Sr. Esteche al desenvolvimiento del plan aqu\u00ed ejecutado y tuvo lugar meses antes de la firma del acuerdo con Ir\u00e1n, lo que demuestra -tambi\u00e9n- la planificaci\u00f3n y el conocimiento con el que actuaban estos sujetos cuando a\u00fan nadie, ni los propios familiares sab\u00edan, siquiera, que se iba a firmar un acuerdo y, mucho menos, pod\u00edan conocer su contenido. Era l\u00f3gico: en el trazado criminal, la maniobra que se perge\u00f1aba los perjudicaba directamente.\nAdem\u00e1s, existen otros elementos que convalidan la vinculaci\u00f3n de Esteche con los iran\u00edes al comprobarse que ha recibido recursos econ\u00f3micos procedentes de Ir\u00e1n. Khalil coment\u00f3 al respecto: \u201c...\u00ab Fernando, la gente que trabaja con Heshmat ...le est\u00e1 bajando recursos ...todos los meses ...fijo todos los meses ...por empleado... \u201d (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 30/11/2012, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-\n2012-\t11-30-163313-28, CD 208). Esta red de vinculaci\u00f3n lo convirti\u00f3 en otro eje importante de los ductos de negociaci\u00f3n y comunicaci\u00f3n, que motorizaron y viabilizaron el plan de encubrimiento en curso.\ne)\tH\u00e9ctor Luis Yrimia\nOtra de las personas que tuvo una participaci\u00f3n relevante, colabor\u00f3 y suministr\u00f3 informaci\u00f3n a los agentes iran\u00edes en Argentina, que aport\u00f3 para la construcci\u00f3n de la nueva hip\u00f3tesis falsa e hizo avanzar el plan encubridor, fue el ex Juez Nacional en lo Criminal de Instrucci\u00f3n y ex Fiscal Federal, Dr. H\u00e9ctor Luis Yrimia.\nEl primer registro contabilizado del contacto entre Jorge \u201cYussuf\u2019 Khalil y H\u00e9ctor Yrimia data de principios de noviembre de 2012: \u201cTuve una charla con el Fiscal...El Fiscal de la causa....el que estaba, no el que est\u00e1 ahora, el que estaba...'\u2019'1 (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 4/11/12, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2012-11-04-130024-6, CD 182). Esto ya ocurr\u00eda poco m\u00e1s de un mes despu\u00e9s que se anunciara p\u00fablicamente la negociaci\u00f3n con Ir\u00e1n y antes de la firma del Memorando de Entendimiento.\nPresente el desarrollo de los acontecimientos posteriores, es de toda l\u00f3gica que para esa \u00e9poca ya se estuviera trabajando en la construcci\u00f3n de la pista alternativa, de la falsa hip\u00f3tesis que desplazar\u00eda la imputaci\u00f3n a los acusados iran\u00edes.\nYrimia se sum\u00f3 al plan e inici\u00f3 sus fluidos contactos con los referentes locales de Teher\u00e1n gracias a la intermediaci\u00f3n de Fernando Esteche. Y as\u00ed lo explic\u00f3 Khalil: \u201c...Y, el que me sienta es Fernando\u201d. (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 4/11/12, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2012- 11-04-130024-6, CD 182), quien lo sugiere como fuente de informaci\u00f3n \u201ceso te puede servir bien concreto para cualquiera de las tesis ...cualquiera de las cosas que vayan a resolverse va a servir porque es informaci\u00f3n\u201d (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 18/12/2012, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-\n2012-\t12-18-183332-8,\tCD 226). Y existen importantes elementos que lo\nvinculan con la Secretar\u00eda de Inteligencia: \u201cel fiscal de AMIA es de ellos, Yrimia\u201d (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 18/12/2012, abonado 1 1-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2012-12-18-183332-8, CD 226). Estas referencias indican que el Dr. Yrimia responder\u00eda al mismo sector de la Secretar\u00eda de Inteligencia que \u201cAlian\u201d, quien sostiene:\t\u201c ...Yrimia. ..es empleado m\u00edo ese...\u201d\n(Comunicaci\u00f3n del 7/10/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-\n2013-\t10-07-141519-20,\tCD 171).\nLos contactos de Jorge \u201cYussuf\u2019 Khalil con el Dr. H\u00e9ctor Luis Yrimia continuaron mes tras mes y se fueron profundizando. En enero de 2014, Khalil le coment\u00f3 a Abdul Karim Paz: \u201c...Hoy habl\u00e9 con el ex juez y ex fiscal de la causa AMIA, Yrimia...tuve una reuni\u00f3n dos horas...\u201d (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 19/1/14, abonado 11-3964-0799, Archivo IN-12177- 20140119-003044, CD 49).\nDe hecho, para la misma \u00e9poca se registraron conversaciones entre Khalil y H\u00e9ctor Luis Yrimia, que dan cuenta de su participaci\u00f3n en el plan delictivo (Comunicaciones del 20/01/2014, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2014-01-20-205332-26 CD 276 y Comunicaci\u00f3n del 24/01/2014, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2014-01 -24-153750- 18, CD 280).\nYa en febrero de 2014 se registraron comunicaciones en las que el abogado se ha identificado, sin dejar lugar a ninguna hesitaci\u00f3n: ''\"'...Buen d\u00eda, Jorge. Luis Yrimia...\u201d, a lo cual Khalil respondi\u00f3: \u201c\u00bfC\u00f3mo le va, doctor querido?\u2019\u2019'\u2019 (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 11/02/2014, abonado 11-3238- 4699, Archivo B-1009-2014-02-11-114448-6, CD 298).\nEl importante grado de confianza que revelan los contactos entre Khalil e Yrimia no solo se condice con los serios asuntos que los unen sino que dan cuenta del avance en sus tareas. Hay evidencias que confirman que Jorge Khalil reuni\u00f3, en m\u00e1s de una oportunidad, al Dr. Yrimia con el Encargado de Negocios de Ir\u00e1n en Argentina, circunstancia de la cual solo estaba al tanto el agente de inteligencia \u201cAlian\u201d (Comunicaciones del 23/01/2014, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2014-01-23-212332- 26, CD 279; Comunicaci\u00f3n del 24/01/2014, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2014-01-24-153750-18, CD 280; Comunicaci\u00f3n del 11/02/2014, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-l009-2014-02-11-114448- 6, CD 298).\nAdem\u00e1s, existen datos que demuestran que los temas entre ambos se fueron diversificando y abordaron la posibilidad de producir acercamientos religiosos (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 19/01/2014, abonado 11-3238- 4699, Archivo B-l009-2014-01-19-002737-2, CD 275). As\u00ed lo reconoci\u00f3 el mismo Khalil al comentar: \u201c...me junto con el n\u00famero uno de los que operan pol\u00edticamente para el Vaticano...son los que est\u00e1n acomodando toda la historia...\u201d, en alusi\u00f3n a la fabricaci\u00f3n de la pista falta que redireccione la investigaci\u00f3n de la causa \u201cAMIA\u201d hacia otra hip\u00f3tesis y nuevos imputados. Y agreg\u00f3: \u201c...nosotros estamos hablando de trabajar, de hacer un trabajo conjunto entre la iglesia y el chiismo...esas son las excusas. Ahora, despu\u00e9s, estos tipos operaron mucho el tema... uno fue... ex juez de la causa AMIA...Yrimia...Yrimia...con ese me junto hoy...\u201d (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 22/01/2014, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-\n2014-\t01-22-102353-16, CD 278).\nLa reuni\u00f3n por cuestiones religiosas, completamente ajena al objeto de la denuncia, constituye una excusa, como lo reconoce Khalil, toda vez que la vinculaci\u00f3n con Yrimia gir\u00f3 siempre en tomo al encubrimiento de los acusados por AMIA.\nDe hecho, al hablar de \u201cAlian\u201d, tanto Khalil como Yrimia se refieren al \u201camigo en com\u00fan\u201d, con quien deben juntarse por \u201cel otro tema\u201d, es decir, la cuesti\u00f3n \u201caparte del trabajo religioso\u201d, en clara alusi\u00f3n a la causa AMIA y la elaboraci\u00f3n de la hip\u00f3tesis que sirva para despistar la investigaci\u00f3n y desarticular la acusaci\u00f3n contra los iran\u00edes (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 03/02/2014, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2014-02-03- 144547-22, CD 290).\nNo puede soslayarse una referencia al enmascaramiento con que estos personajes han cubierto sus actividades delictivas. Mientras se reun\u00edan por cuestiones l\u00edcitas y leg\u00edtimas, como ser el acercamiento entre dos religiones, han motorizado, al mismo tiempo y en las mismas reuniones, el plan criminal encabezado por la Sra. Presidente y el Sr. Canciller.\nEsta forma de actuar es, lamentablemente, conocida para esta Unidad Fiscal pues se trata nada menos que del modo dual que los agentes iran\u00edes han utilizado para ocultar actividades subrepticias y hasta delictivas. Ocultan sus fines criminales detr\u00e1s de fachadas religiosas o culturales. As\u00ed, es realmente preocupante ver replicado ese accionar en este nuevo encubrimiento o, al menos, en una parte de \u00e9l.\nConcluyendo, lo cierto es que el plan para generar la impunidad definitiva de los acusados iran\u00edes sigue vigente. Sus part\u00edcipes\n\n\nMinisterio P\u00fablico de la Naci\u00f3n\ncontin\u00faan trabajando, tal como ha podido comprobarse en los recientes p\u00e1rrafos.\nLa contribuci\u00f3n del Dr. Yrimia al plan criminal ha sido sustancial. Ha puesto al servicio de la maniobra de encubrimiento su conocimiento sobre la causa AMIA. Se trata de un conocimiento espec\u00edfico pues lo ha obtenido en el ejercicio de su anterior cargo como Fiscal Federal especialmente designado por la Procuraci\u00f3n General de la Naci\u00f3n para intervenir en la investigaci\u00f3n del atentado perpetrado contra la sede de la AMIA (Resoluci\u00f3n N\u00b037/94 del 18/07/1994), por instrucci\u00f3n expresa del Ministerio de Justicia (Resoluci\u00f3n N\u00b083 de la misma fecha).\nEn esa condici\u00f3n ha conocido los hechos en detalle, ha visto las pruebas, las testimoniales, los peritajes, los informes t\u00e9cnicos, el resultado de los allanamientos, ha escuchado las versiones de los primeros imputados. Este minucioso grado de cognici\u00f3n lo ha vuelto fundamental para el buen desarrollo del plan.\nY\tjustamente su aporte se ha realizado donde resulta m\u00e1s \u00fatil: en el armado de la hip\u00f3tesis falsa. Estuvo y est\u00e1 en condiciones de indicar con certeza si tal o cual teor\u00eda resulta veros\u00edmil o no, si encaja con las probanzas con que cuenta el expediente, si debe modificarse alg\u00fan punto, etc. Es decir que, vali\u00e9ndose de la informaci\u00f3n obtenida en ocasi\u00f3n de ejercer la funci\u00f3n p\u00fablica, se ha abocado a esta participaci\u00f3n criminal. Adem\u00e1s, tampoco puede soslayarse que se ha desempe\u00f1ado varios a\u00f1os como Juez de la Naci\u00f3n. De all\u00ed que tambi\u00e9n posea los conocimientos t\u00e9cnicos necesarios para viabilizar la falsa hip\u00f3tesis.\nEs evidente, entonces, que su aporte ha resultado extremadamente valioso en el plan delictivo aqu\u00ed denunciado.\nd)\tAndr\u00e9s Larrogue\nHa quedado demostrado que tanto Luis D\u2019El\u00eda como Jorge \u201cYussuf\u2019 Khalil son personas que han sido cuidadosamente seleccionadas para oficiar de nexos clandestinos en el plan de encubrimiento. Una de las\ncualidades que comparten es que, pese a la profunda consustanciaci\u00f3n con los gobiernos a los que representan y la confianza que inspiran en sus mandantes, no son figuras oficiales. No ejercen cargos p\u00fablicos ni tienen responsabilidades pol\u00edticas visibles en los gobiernos a los que sirven. Pero como denominador com\u00fan, operan muy cerca del poder, son de confianza del poder y, valga la redundancia, poseen -en sus respectivos \u00e1mbitos- mucho poder.\nPara intermediar entre los autores del plan delictivo y varios de sus ejecutores, se recurri\u00f3 a una persona que pudiera dar cuenta, f\u00e1cilmente, de sus contactos tanto con unos como con otros: el Diputado Nacional Andr\u00e9s Larroque, quien ha oficiado de nexo entre la Presidenta de la Naci\u00f3n, Dra. Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez y Luis D\u2019El\u00eda, a los efectos de avanzar con el delito aqu\u00ed denunciado.\nEsta afirmaci\u00f3n no es una simple conjetura, ni siquiera se trata de una inferencia o una deducci\u00f3n. Aqu\u00ed se reproduce prueba directa que lo demuestra. Khalil ha admitido sin ambages haber recibido mensajes directamente de parte de Larroque: \u201c...yo estuve hablando con D'El\u00eday con el \u2018Cuervo \u2019 Larroque y me pidieron eso y yo lo transmit\u00ed al Saf\u00edr  y el Safir me dijo lo mismo...no hagamos algo que pueda molestar\u2019''' (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 18/11/2012, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2012-11-18- 095153-16, CD 196). Respecto al mismo encuentro aclar\u00f3: \u201c...reci\u00e9n he tenido una reuni\u00f3n con Luis D\u2019El\u00eda y el \u2018Cuervo\u2019 Larroque, el de La C\u00e1mpora...que quer\u00edan hablar conmigo, que ten\u00edan un mensaje del gobierno para dar...y ahora me voy para Mart\u00ednez a dar el mensaje, a la casa del Embajador\u2019\u2019\u2019 (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 17/11/2012, abonado 11-3315- 6908, Archivo B-1009-2012-1 l-17-104846-10.wav, CD 195).\nLa interacci\u00f3n es evidente. Larroque ha transmitido mensajes emanados de las autoridades del gobierno nacional involucradas en el encubrimiento y Khalil los ha hecho llegar a la contraparte iran\u00ed. Se trataron de mensajes relativos al plan criminal comunicados a trav\u00e9s de canales paralelos.\nLa intermediaci\u00f3n de Larroque entre Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez y D\u2019El\u00eda qued\u00f3 evidenciada ante la opini\u00f3n p\u00fablica en general cuando se public\u00f3 que el Diputado le hab\u00eda transmitido a D'El\u00eda el siguiente mensaje: \u201cDice Cristina que no hables m\u00e1s hasta las elecciones\u201d (\u201cCristina furiosa con D'El\u00eda: No hables m\u00e1s hasta las elecciones\u201d, La Pol\u00edtica On Line, 26/9/2013). Esta informaci\u00f3n period\u00edstica se condice en un todo con los datos que surgen de las conversaciones telef\u00f3nicas aqu\u00ed transcriptas y/o referenciadas, en tanto que a trav\u00e9s suyo ha entrado y salido la informaci\u00f3n al despacho presidencial, al menos, en varios episodios relacionados con los hechos aqu\u00ed denunciados.\nEste rol de intermediario tambi\u00e9n fue necesario en las cuestiones comerciales que han estado subyacentes al encubrimiento. As\u00ed, Khalil dio cuenta de haber transmitido mensajes sobre temas comerciales con Ir\u00e1n: \u201c...yo fui a hablar con D'El\u00eda y le dije...todas las propuestas y de la canciller\u00eda, de la canciller\u00eda tambi\u00e9n...lo que me hab\u00eda propuesto... Y \u00e9l lo elev\u00f3 al \u201cCuervo\u201d Larroque...el de \u201cLa C\u00e1mpora\", el Jefe de \u201cLa C\u00e1mpora\u201d...Y ya iban a hablar con Cristina...\u201d (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 14/05/2013, abonado 11-3238-4699, Archivo B-1009-2013-05-14-131007- 12.wav, CD 0025).\nCuando a\u00fan no se hab\u00eda firmado el acuerdo, Larroque ya intermediaba para evitar complicaciones que pudieran da\u00f1ar el acercamiento con Teher\u00e1n. As\u00ed, en noviembre de 2012, junto con Luis D'El\u00eda, le solicit\u00f3 a Khalil que no sumara a los grupos que lidera de la comunidad iran\u00ed local a una marcha organizada por partidos de izquierda en defensa de la \u201ccausa palestina\u201d y, tambi\u00e9n, que cesara con los reproches y reclamos, porque ese tipo de acciones pod\u00edan repercutir en las florecientes relaciones bilaterales.\nAl respecto, cont\u00f3 Khalil: \u201c...Hoy a la ma\u00f1ana tuve una reuni\u00f3n con la gente del gobierno, me pidieron que por favor no vaya a la reuni\u00f3n... \u201d y le dijeron: \u201c...Par\u00e1 la bronca, porque el tema de...puede repercutir en las relaciones que est\u00e1n manteniendo, las conversaciones que estamos teniendo nosotros en Ginebra... \u201d, en clara alusi\u00f3n a las rondas diplom\u00e1ticas que gestaron el pacto con Ir\u00e1n. Y agreg\u00f3: \u201c...Entonces no quiero que ninguno de nosotros, que representa a la Rep\u00fablica Isl\u00e1mica de una u otra manera... o de la comunidad nuestra...no tiene que ir a ninguno de esos...Ya lo habl\u00e9 con Larroque y con D'El\u00eda... \u201d (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 17/11/2012, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-l009-2012-11-17-183444- 8, CD 195). Al d\u00eda siguiente, relat\u00f3: \u201c...nosotros no estamos haciendo ninguna manifestaci\u00f3n ac\u00e1, porque estamos en plenas negociaciones con el gobierno... a esa reuni\u00f3n la convoqu\u00e9 y o... pero despu\u00e9s la tir\u00e9 para atr\u00e1s ...porque en base a las negociaciones que se est\u00e1n haciendo entre Ir\u00e1n y Argentina, no queremos vernos inmiscuidos nosotros. Aparte fue un pedido del gobierno. Yo estuve hablando con D'El\u00eda y con el Cuervo Larroque y me pidieron eso y yo lo transmit\u00ed al Safir...y el Safir me dijo lo mismo... 'no hagamos algo que, que pueda molestar\u201d (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 18/11/2012, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2012-11-18-095153- 16, CD 196). Y le confes\u00f3 a Esteche: \u201c...el s\u00e1bado fui a la casa del gordo, habl\u00e9 con el gordo y el gordo adelante m\u00edo lo llam\u00f3 al cuervo, puso el altavoz...Cuervo, estoy con Yussefbla bla bla...le estoy diciendo que lo que me dijiste que transmita. As\u00ed, eh?...\u201d, refiri\u00e9ndose, respectivamente, a Luis D'El\u00eda y Andr\u00e9s Larroque (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 19/11/2012, abonado 11- 3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2012-11-19-121034-16, CD 197).\nToda esta secuencia expone la intervenci\u00f3n del Diputado Larroque para, conforme lo necesitaba el plan encubridor de la Dra. Fern\u00e1ndez, proteger las negociaciones con Teher\u00e1n de cualquier tensi\u00f3n innecesaria. Ello, sin perjuicio de otros aportes directos ya mencionados, tendientes al objetivo criminal aqu\u00ed denunciado.\nAdem\u00e1s, como ya se refiri\u00f3 en ac\u00e1pites previos, Larroque tambi\u00e9n ha estado en contacto con Fernando Esteche, quien reconoci\u00f3: \u201c...hoy lo tengo que ver, si, hoy vengo a Capital a verlo a \u00e9l..\u201d, en alusi\u00f3n al legislador (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 19/11/2012, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-l009-2012-11-19-121034-16, CD 197). Tan es as\u00ed, que en funci\u00f3n del v\u00ednculo existente entre Esteche y Larroque, Khalil le pidi\u00f3 que lo ayude a construir una relaci\u00f3n directa con el diputado (Comunicaci\u00f3n del 20/11/2012, abonado 11-3315-6908, Archivo B-1009-2012-11-20-131705- 12, CD 198).\nEn suma, el Diputado Larroque ha operado, en el marco de este plan, como nexo entre la Sra. Presidente y Luis D'El\u00eda, le ha llevado mensajes e indicaciones al referente de Teher\u00e1n, Jorge Khalil, y se ha mantenido en comunicaciones con Fernando Esteche en relaci\u00f3n al plan encubridor. Un actor clave en la articulaci\u00f3n de las comunicaciones y negociaciones que viabilizaron la maniobra denunciada.\nVII.\t- Conclusiones:\nDurante el desarrollo de la presente denuncia se han explicado en detalle los hechos y se han expuesto m\u00faltiples elementos de prueba que demuestran que la Sra. Presidente de la Naci\u00f3n Argentina, Dra. Cristina Elisabet Fern\u00e1ndez, emiti\u00f3 una expresa directiva para que se dise\u00f1ara y ejecutara un plan tendiente a desvincular a los acusados de nacionalidad iran\u00ed de la causa por el atentado contra la sede de la AMIA, a efectos de brindarles impunidad definitiva.\nSe ha acreditado tambi\u00e9n que dicha directiva estuvo motivada en la decisi\u00f3n de la primera mandataria de producir un acercamiento de car\u00e1cter geopol\u00edtico como as\u00ed tambi\u00e9n de restablecer plenas relaciones comerciales a nivel estatal con la Rep\u00fablica Isl\u00e1mica de Ir\u00e1n, al entender que ello paliar\u00eda sustancialmente la crisis energ\u00e9tica nacional.\nAs\u00ed, los elementos de prueba demostraron que el plan ideado por la Sra. Presidente fue instrumentado principalmente por su canciller, Sr. H\u00e9ctor Timerman. Que insumi\u00f3 dos a\u00f1os de negociaciones tanto secretas como p\u00fablicas con autoridades de la Rep\u00fablica Isl\u00e1mica de Ir\u00e1n, en las cuales las autoridades argentinas dejaron de lado el reclamo de justicia por el caso AMIA y acordaron dar de baja las notificaciones rojas de Interpol como un primer paso para desvincular definitivamente de la investigaci\u00f3n judicial a todos los acusados iran\u00edes.\nUno de los medios elegidos, quiz\u00e1s el m\u00e1s visible pero no el \u00fanico, para cumplir con ese objetivo convenido de antemano fue el \u201cMemorando de Entendimiento\u201d presentado como el resultado de las negociaciones entre las partes, cuando en realidad, seg\u00fan la prueba obtenida, se trat\u00f3 del instrumento que permite viabilizar la destrucci\u00f3n de las imputaciones contra los acusados iran\u00edes.\nSe acredit\u00f3 que dicho Memorando de Entendimiento ha cumplido un papel central en la maniobra de encubrimiento. Fue la v\u00eda que esgrimieron los socios del plan criminal para instar la baja de las notificaciones rojas de Interpol. Adem\u00e1s, el documento estaba destinado a garantizar la impunidad de los pr\u00f3fugos iran\u00edes mediante la actuaci\u00f3n de la \u201cComisi\u00f3n de la Verdad\u201d, cuyas conclusiones -como se vio- ya estaban pactadas de antemano. Esta Comisi\u00f3n dar\u00eda lugar a la nueva hip\u00f3tesis falsa que, basada en pruebas inventadas, hab\u00eda sido fabricada para reemplazar las acusaciones sostenidas por la pesquisa judicial.\nQued\u00f3 demostrado adem\u00e1s que los autores de esta confabulaci\u00f3n criminal -Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez y H\u00e9ctor Timerman- fueron secundados por un grupo de part\u00edcipes, especialmente elegidos por sus\nantecedentes y su consustanciaci\u00f3n con el plan criminal aqu\u00ed denunciado.\n/\nQued\u00f3 clara la participaci\u00f3n de Luis Angel D\u2019El\u00eda, Jorge Alejandro \u201cYussuf\u2019 Khalil, Fernando Esteche, del Diputado Nacional Andr\u00e9s Larroque, del ex Fiscal designado para actuar en la causa AMIA, Dr. H\u00e9ctor Luis Yrimia y del agente de inteligencia conocido como \u201cAlian\u201d, que las pruebas indican que su verdadero nombre ser\u00eda Ram\u00f3n Alian H\u00e9ctor Bogado.\nSe expusieron, asimismo, los elementos de prueba que acreditaron que tanto la Sra. Presidente de la Naci\u00f3n como el Sr. Canciller efectuaron aportes personales al perfeccionamiento de la maniobra delictiva.\nAUS&\nDe las contribuciones concretas y espec\u00edficas de la Sra. Presidente, surgi\u00f3 con claridad que no solamente fue quien decidi\u00f3 la articulaci\u00f3n de este plan criminal de impunidad y que se vali\u00f3 de distintos actores para llevar adelante su ejecuci\u00f3n, sino que en todo momento estuvo en control de la maniobra, ya sea impartiendo \u00f3rdenes directas a sus c\u00f3mplices, o bien encabezando la necesaria campa\u00f1a discursiva para camuflar la perpetraci\u00f3n del delito.\nAs\u00ed, ha elegido a algunos de los part\u00edcipes del encubrimiento, involucrando directamente a -cuanto menos- uno de sus ministros y a un legislador nacional; ha controlado la evoluci\u00f3n del plan en cada paso; ha negociado por interp\u00f3sitas personas con uno de los pr\u00f3fugos; y se ha involucrado personalmente en algunas acciones de ocultamiento que este sofisticado plan requer\u00eda.\nEn el caso del Ministro de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto de la Naci\u00f3n, se demostr\u00f3 holgadamente que H\u00e9ctor Timerman ha sido -sin duda alguna- el principal instrumentador del plan de impunidad ideado y ordenado por la Sra. Presidente, Dra. Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez.\nDesde su funci\u00f3n, transmiti\u00f3 a Ir\u00e1n la decisi\u00f3n del gobierno argentino de abandonar el reclamo de justicia en la causa AMIA; acord\u00f3 la baja de las notificaciones rojas; sign\u00f3 acuerdos secretos con la parte iran\u00ed; particip\u00f3 de las negociaciones, de la redacci\u00f3n y de la firma del Memorando de Entendimiento, pieza central del plan de impunidad. Y se involucr\u00f3 personalmente en la campa\u00f1a de descr\u00e9dito y enga\u00f1o, destinada a destruir la credibilidad de la causa judicial con el fin de, dolosamente, presentar al acuerdo con Ir\u00e1n como la \u00fanica v\u00eda apta para solucionar el caso.\nAmbos funcionarios actuaron con un \u00fanico prop\u00f3sito: lograr la impunidad definitiva de los acusados y el cese de toda actividad jurisdiccional en su contra, para lograr su objetivo \u00faltimo de comerciar libremente a nivel estatal con Ir\u00e1n y acercarse geopol\u00edticamente a Teher\u00e1n, sin soportar reproche alguno por parte de la opini\u00f3n p\u00fablica argentina y mundial. Ello, seg\u00fan surge de la evidencia reunida y sin descartar en modo alguno la existencia de otros motivos adicionales a los aqu\u00ed expuestos, pero que en nada modifican o disminuyen la criminal responsabilidad de los denunciados.\nEn el cumplimiento de este entramado delictivo han sucedido situaciones realmente alarmantes. Mientras la justicia dedic\u00f3 y dedica ingentes esfuerzos a lograr la detenci\u00f3n y posterior enjuiciamiento de quienes ha se\u00f1alado \u201cprima facie\u201d como responsables de haber participado en el atentado del 18 de julio de 1994, el Poder Ejecutivo Nacional ha negociado en secreto, justamente con uno de esos imputados, Mohsen Rabbani, la compra y venta de petr\u00f3leo por granos y, fundamentalmente, su impunidad.\nEstas acciones han motivado, con justa raz\u00f3n, que se advierta sobre la inaudita gravedad institucional de la maniobra que se denuncia, pues a trav\u00e9s del plan criminal no solo se intenta destruir la investigaci\u00f3n judicial del mayor atentado terrorista que ha sufrido nuestro pa\u00eds, sino que en la ideaci\u00f3n, planificaci\u00f3n e instrumentaci\u00f3n del delito han participado algunas de las m\u00e1s altas autoridades del gobierno nacional, incluyendo la cabeza del Poder Ejecutivo.\nEn raz\u00f3n de la inusual extensi\u00f3n de la presente denuncia, resulta conveniente rese\u00f1ar brevemente los puntos m\u00e1s relevantes que han sido probados en esta presentaci\u00f3n y que se han tenido en cuenta para formar la convicci\u00f3n acerca de la comisi\u00f3n de un concurso de delitos de acci\u00f3n p\u00fablica. A saber:\n\u2022\tQue la decisi\u00f3n de la Sra. Presidente, Dra. Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez, de brindarle impunidad a los acusados iran\u00edes y desvincularlos de la investigaci\u00f3n por el atentado contra la sede de la AMIA, estuvo motivada -al menos- en razones de \u00edndole geopol\u00edtica y comercial. La primera mandataria entendi\u00f3 que el petr\u00f3leo iran\u00ed tendr\u00eda la capacidad de aliviar la severa crisis energ\u00e9tica que viene atravesando el pa\u00eds. Intercambios, a modo de ejemplo, de \u201cgranos por petr\u00f3leo\u201d (sic) fueron vistos como una soluci\u00f3n a la situaci\u00f3n de emergencia,\n\n'LBERTO\nFISCAL GENERAL\n\nm\u00e1s all\u00e1 del inter\u00e9s en acercarse a Teher\u00e1n, como parte de un nuevo posicionamiento geopol\u00edtico en el actual escenario mundial.\n\u2022\tQue estos intereses geopol\u00edticos y comerciales fueron reconocidos por los propios part\u00edcipes: \u201c...estamos en otro pa\u00eds, es otra situaci\u00f3n mundial y hay que trabajar en otro contexto...\u201d y \u201c...el tema que necesita Argentina, es petr\u00f3leo...hay un verdadero inter\u00e9s para empezar y entablar las relaciones comerciales de gobierno a gobierno, con funcionarios del gobierno de ac\u00e1, una delegaci\u00f3n de all\u00e1 viajar\u00eda o a Caracas o al Golfo o a Beirut mejor ...para empezar las relaciones directas de funcionarios a funcionarios... \u201d.\n\u2022\tQue la resoluci\u00f3n presidencial que pretende alinearse y/o comerciar a nivel estatal con la Rep\u00fablica Isl\u00e1mica de Ir\u00e1n no es cuestionable judicialmente por tratarse de funciones propias del Poder Ejecutivo Nacional, en tanto conductor de las relaciones exteriores del pa\u00eds.\n\u2022\tQue la opci\u00f3n elegida por la Sra. Presidente y el Sr. Canciller para habilitar el mencionado acercamiento geopol\u00edtico y la v\u00eda comercial fue lo que motiv\u00f3 esta denuncia, por la sencilla y \u00fanica raz\u00f3n de que optaron por un camino ilegal y delictivo e incurrieron en conductas tipificadas en nuestro C\u00f3digo Penal, al ordenar la diagramaci\u00f3n y ejecuci\u00f3n de un plan destinado a desvincular definitivamente a los acusados iran\u00edes del caso AMIA.\n\u2022\tContrario a esta decisi\u00f3n y acciones delictivas, durante la presidencia de N\u00e9stor Kirchner se rechazaron rotundamente todos los ofrecimientos de Teher\u00e1n, siempre destinados a acordar una salida pol\u00edticamente negociada a esta cuesti\u00f3n, netamente judicial. De ello dieron cuenta varios testimonios coincidentes -del ex Jefe de Gabinete, Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez; de los ex Cancilleres, Rafael Bielsa y\nJorge Taiana y del ex Vice Canciller, Roberto Garc\u00eda Morit\u00e1n- que describen los pactos propuestos por Ir\u00e1n y su rechazo por parte del el ex presidente argentino.\n\u2022\tQue el plan perge\u00f1ado por Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez incluy\u00f3 el cese de las notificaciones rojas de Interpol -inesperadamente frustrado por el firme accionar del Secretario General Ronald K. Noble-, la firma de un documento jur\u00eddico bilateral con capacidad para viabilizar la impunidad de los acusados iran\u00edes, el redireccionamiento fraudulento de la investigaci\u00f3n judicial hacia una nueva pista falsa con pruebas inventadas, el desenvolvimiento de una campa\u00f1a medi\u00e1tica y discursiva para horadar la credibilidad de las conclusiones de la justicia nacional y la manipulaci\u00f3n de los familiares de las v\u00edctimas, de los sobrevivientes del atentado y de las instituciones comunitarias jud\u00edas damnificadas por el ataque terrorista de 1994.\n\u2022\tQue dicho plan de impunidad principi\u00f3 en el mes de enero de 2011, en la ciudad siria de Alepo, ocasi\u00f3n en la que el Canciller Timerman le comunic\u00f3 a su par iran\u00ed Ali Akbar Salehi que \u201cArgentina ya no est\u00e1 m\u00e1s interesada en resolver aquellos dos atentados...en cambio prefiere mejorar las relaciones econ\u00f3micas con Ir\u00e1n...\u201d. Es la primera vez que un estado agredido implora a un estado agresor que firme un acuerdo por el cual les otorgar\u00e1 impunidad a los agresores.\n\u2022\tQue las tratativas con los representantes de la Rep\u00fablica Isl\u00e1mica de Ir\u00e1n se mantuvieron en secreto hasta el mes de septiembre de 2012, cuando la Sra. Presidente anunci\u00f3 p\u00fablicamente el \u201cinicio\u201d de un proceso de negociaci\u00f3n con Ir\u00e1n.\n\u2022\tQue una vez oficializadas las reuniones y vali\u00e9ndose del secreto propio de la actividad diplom\u00e1tica formal, se mantuvo oculto el contenido de las conversaciones, como una necesidad l\u00f3gica de los\n\u2022\tinvolucrados de tapar las maniobras delictivas que estaban llevando adelante.\n\u2022\tQue con fecha 27 de enero de 2013 se firm\u00f3 en el Reino de Etiop\u00eda, el Memorando de Entendimiento, lo que vino a confirmar que las negociaciones no hab\u00edan procurado generar una herramienta para facilitar la cooperaci\u00f3n judicial con la causa AMIA y/o la extradici\u00f3n de los imputados, sino que se hab\u00eda redactado un instrumento jur\u00eddico, con apariencia de legalidad que viabilizara, a la par de ocultar, la decisi\u00f3n acordada de antemano: la impunidad definitiva de los acusados iran\u00edes.\n\u2022\tLuego de suscribirse el acuerdo, el agente de inteligencia argentino \u201cAlian\u201d le confes\u00f3 a su par de Ir\u00e1n: \u201c...Tranquilo, ya ganamos, es decir, ganamos una partida, yo te dije, vos no me ten\u00edas fe...\u201d, dejando en evidencia que ambas partes han tenido el mismo objetivo criminal. De all\u00ed que se compruebe que no se trata, como se present\u00f3 p\u00fablicamente, de dos partes que negocian un acuerdo bilateral, sino de dos socios que participan de un sofisticado plan criminal de impunidad para desligar definitivamente a los pr\u00f3fugos de la causa AMIA de toda relaci\u00f3n con el atentado y cerrar toda investigaci\u00f3n respecto de ellos.\n\u2022\tQue la ambig\u00fcedad, vaguedad y omisi\u00f3n del texto del Memorando de Entendimiento han sido ingredientes relevantes de la ingenier\u00eda encubridora aqu\u00ed denunciada, dado que han dotado al plan criminal de la necesaria flexibilidad jur\u00eddica y sem\u00e1ntica para que los autores de este encubrimiento puedan adaptar la implementaci\u00f3n de sus disposiciones a la aleatoriedad de factores externos y ajenos que eventualmente surjan durante la consecuci\u00f3n del plan.\nQue la intrincada redacci\u00f3n del memorando confirm\u00f3 la existencia de un trabajo minucioso y pensado al detalle para viabilizar la impunidad. As\u00ed qued\u00f3 establecido el dolo directo con que actuaron los protagonistas del plan que, con pleno conocimiento de la finalidad de sus acciones, buscaron desvincular a los iran\u00edes de las imputaciones por el atentado.\n\u2022\tQue para ello, el Canciller H\u00e9ctor Timerman se comprometi\u00f3 a dar de baja las notificaciones rojas que pesaban y pesan sobre cinco acusados iran\u00edes. Por tal raz\u00f3n se redact\u00f3 el punto 7o del Memorando de Entendimiento, \u00fanico con car\u00e1cter operativo. La sola firma del pacto habilit\u00f3 la comunicaci\u00f3n a Interpol, con el prop\u00f3sito de que procediera a la inmediata baja de las notificaciones rojas, como fue admitido sin ambages por la diplomacia iran\u00ed.\n\u2022\tQue la Organizaci\u00f3n Internacional de Polic\u00eda Criminal (Interpol) intervino oportunamente en el caso, garantizando la vigencia de las notificaciones rojas, frustrando, al menos hasta el momento, la promesa asumida por el Sr. Timerman.\n\u2022\tQue tal situaci\u00f3n no solo provoc\u00f3 la queja p\u00fablica del Canciller Iran\u00ed,\nque demand\u00f3: \u201c...seg\u00fan el acuerdo firmado por ambos pa\u00edses, la Interpol (Polic\u00eda Internacional) debe eliminar las acusaciones contra las autoridades iran\u00edes...\", sino que ello tambi\u00e9n qued\u00f3 registrado en los canales paralelos de comunicaci\u00f3n con Teher\u00e1n:\t.Timerman\tno\ncumpli\u00f3 con algunas cosas. Esto es as\u00ed de claro. No cumpli\u00f3 con algunas cosas...\". Esto motiv\u00f3, en Ir\u00e1n, el retiro del acuerdo del tr\u00e1mite parlamentario de aprobaci\u00f3n que se hab\u00eda iniciado y hasta la fecha, no se ha notificado oficialmente la ratificaci\u00f3n ni ha tenido lugar el intercambio de notas reversales.\n\n\n\u2022\tQue el Canciller Timerman no s\u00f3lo suscribi\u00f3 el Memorando de Entendimiento, sino que cerr\u00f3, al menos, dos compromisos secretos e ilegales. As\u00ed fue explicado por Khalil, al d\u00eda siguiente de su regreso de Teher\u00e1n: \u201c...me parece que el ruso este de mierda  se mand\u00f3 alguna....estaba firmado algo, donde estaba el tema de las cautelares ...\u201d y ratificado, en marzo de 2013, por el entonces Ministro de Relaciones Exteriores iran\u00ed, Al\u00ed Akbar Salehi: \u201c...El  del acuerdo entre Ir\u00e1n y Argentina en relaci\u00f3n con la cuesti\u00f3n AMIA ser\u00e1 hecho p\u00fablico en el momento adecuado...\u201d. No hablaba del Memorando de Entendimiento, sino de otro acuerdo que dos meses despu\u00e9s de firmado y publicitado el memorando, a\u00fan permanec\u00eda en secreto. Y en este marco deben entenderse tambi\u00e9n otras manifestaciones de Jorge \u201cYussuf\u2019 Khalil, cuando comentando noticias period\u00edsticas que difund\u00edan que el ex Ministro de Defensa iran\u00ed, Ahmad Vahidi, nunca ser\u00eda interrogado pese a estar incluido en el Memorando, asegur\u00f3 que ese tema en particular \u201cestaba conversado antes ....estaba dentro del marco\u201d y que el acuerdo \u201ces m\u00e1s profundo todav\u00eda\u201d.\n\u2022\tQue el Memorando de Entendimiento prev\u00e9 otros mecanismos para lograr la impunidad de los acusados. La \u201cComisi\u00f3n de la Verdad\u201d prevista en el acuerdo ha sido creada para desacreditar la investigaci\u00f3n llevada a cabo por la justicia argentina y legitimar una nueva y falsa versi\u00f3n de los hechos, fabricada para redireccionar la pesquisa hacia otros imputados, con el objeto de desvincular a los iran\u00edes. As\u00ed lo han reconocido los encubridores: \u201c...alguien va a salir con la cara manchada de ac\u00e1...eso ya est\u00e1 arreglado... \u00bfC\u00f3mo va a ser para el lado nuestro, boludo? Si nosotros estamos sentados en la mesa...\u201d.\n\u2022\tQue la impunidad se acord\u00f3 en forma previa a la firma del Memorando e incluy\u00f3 la elaboraci\u00f3n de una hip\u00f3tesis alternativa con pruebas falsas para desviar en forma fraudulenta la investigaci\u00f3n judicial a terceros, desincriminando a los iran\u00edes. En referencia a ello, en una fecha tan temprana como diciembre de 2012, Esteche asever\u00f3: \u201c...quieren construir un nuevo enemigo de la AMIA, el nuevo responsable de la AMIA, es una necesidad que tienen que construirla... \u201d. Y de la conversaci\u00f3n se desprende que esa tarea qued\u00f3 a cargo de funcionarios de la Secretar\u00eda de Inteligencia, especialmente designados para esta tarea. Al respecto, tambi\u00e9n se dijo: \u201c...va a venir otra hip\u00f3tesis, con otras pruebas...\u201d y se especulaba que el suscripto, Fiscal de la causa por el atentado a la AMIA quedara \u201c...culo al norte, porque nunca las vio, \u00e9l, las pruebas, lo que viene ahora...\u201d.\n\u2022\tQue los pasos y avances locales del plan fueron comunicados en tiempo real tanto a las autoridades iran\u00edes en Teher\u00e1n como a uno de los pr\u00f3fugos de la causa AMIA, Mohsen Rabbani, quien a\u00fan ostenta un enorme poder decisorio dentro del r\u00e9gimen iran\u00ed y ha sido informado permanentemente de la marcha de su propio encubrimiento.\n\u2022\tQue la circunstancia de que las autoridades iran\u00edes hayan estado al tanto de lo que resolv\u00eda y decid\u00eda el gobierno argentino, volvi\u00f3 a demostrar que el acuerdo, lejos de haber contribuido con la causa, como falsamente se proclam\u00f3, fue un disfraz jur\u00eddico de un acuerdo ilegal previo y mucho m\u00e1s amplio.\n\u2022\tQue la influencia del imputado Rabbani ha desembocado en un hecho penoso. La negociaci\u00f3n activa de los funcionarios nacionales aqu\u00ed acusados con uno de los pr\u00f3fugos a los que estaban, en simult\u00e1neo,\nencubriendo. Es decir, mientras la justicia dedicaba esfuerzos para lograr la detenci\u00f3n y posterior enjuiciamiento de aquellas personas se\u00f1aladas como responsables por el atentado, la Dra. Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez y su Canciller, a trav\u00e9s de interp\u00f3sitas personas negociaban con unos de los principales acusados, Mohsen Rabbani, la compra de petr\u00f3leo y su impunidad. Seg\u00fan dijo el nombrado: \u201c...aqu\u00ed hay algunos sectores del gobierno que me dijeron que estas listos para vender petr\u00f3leo a la Argentina...y tambi\u00e9n comprar armas...\u2019\u2019'\u2019\n\u2022\tQue de forma paralela y para facilitar el avance del encubrimiento la Dra. Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez y el Sr. H\u00e9ctor Timerman desplegaron verdaderas campa\u00f1as de desprestigio, enga\u00f1o y manipulaci\u00f3n mediante la articulaci\u00f3n de una artiller\u00eda de mentiras, falacias, puestas en escena y secretos con el fin de ocultar las intenciones criminales y facilitar la ejecuci\u00f3n del plan de impunidad.\n\u2022\tQue ambos funcionarios mintieron al negar que el acercamiento con Teher\u00e1n estuviera motivado en razones comerciales o geopol\u00edticas. Mintieron tambi\u00e9n cuando aseguraron que el Memorando de Entendimiento solo buscaba verdad y justicia. Cuando dijeron que la vigencia de las notificaciones rojas no estaba en peligro. Cuando expresaron que la causa estaba paralizada. Cuando aseveraron que se firmar\u00eda un anexo al pacto y luego lo negaron. Cuando aseguraron que no iban a permitir que el caso AMIA se transformara en una pieza de ajedrez en la geopol\u00edtica mundial. Cuando dijeron que no exist\u00edan acuerdos o cl\u00e1usulas secretas, entre muchas otras falsedades que fueron se\u00f1aladas a lo largo de esta denuncia.\n\u2022\tQuiz\u00e1s la m\u00e1s dolorosa de las mentiras tuvo como protagonista a la Sra. Presidente, qui\u00e9n p\u00fablicamente le asegur\u00f3 a los sobrevivientes del atentado y a los familiares de las v\u00edctimas, que los consultar\u00eda frente a cualquier propuesta que realizara Teher\u00e1n, previo a tomar alguna decisi\u00f3n. No s\u00f3lo jam\u00e1s hubo consulta alguna sino que los familiares debieron enterarse de la firma del pacto bilateral por los medios de comunicaci\u00f3n. En cambio, el Sr. D'El\u00eda, activamente involucrado en el plan criminal, fue informado de inmediato y de manera personal por el entonces Secretario General de Presidencia de la Naci\u00f3n, Oscar Parrilli.\n\u2022\tQue las actuaciones de la Sra. Presidente y del Sr. Canciller incluyeron tambi\u00e9n una puesta en escena verificada los d\u00edas 27 y 28 de septiembre de 2013, ocasi\u00f3n en la que p\u00fablicamente se inform\u00f3 sobre una reuni\u00f3n entre los cancilleres argentino e iran\u00ed, mientras que subrepticiamente autores y part\u00edcipes del plan coordinaban en secreto las declaraciones y acciones posteriores, para enga\u00f1ar a la opini\u00f3n p\u00fablica y permitir que el plan criminal siguiera su marcha. El operador y part\u00edcipe de este plan Luis D\u2019El\u00eda especific\u00f3 el pedido: \u201c. ..tengo un mensaje urgente del gobierno argentino, para pasar all\u00e1 urgente , antes de ma\u00f1ana...Estoy en la casa de gobierno ahora... no hay asunto m\u00e1s importante que este, cr\u00e9emelo ....necesito que hables con el Sheik de all\u00e1  mira que es muy groso lo que tengo eh!...\u201d. La Sra. Presidente buscaba obtener ciertos pronunciamientos por parte de Teher\u00e1n, funcionales al plan de impunidad.\n\u2022\tQue la realidad, como se acredit\u00f3 a lo largo de la presentaci\u00f3n, demostr\u00f3 ser diametralmente opuesta a lo declamado p\u00fablicamente por la Dra. Fern\u00e1ndez y el Sr. Timerman. Su enga\u00f1o fue premeditado y sus aportes han sido centrales en el plan delictivo. Tan es as\u00ed que los c\u00f3mplices del plan han asegurado que todo estaba \u201ccerrado muy arriba\u201d, todo hab\u00eda sido decidido \u201cal m\u00e1s alto nivel\u201d porque \u201clo pidi\u00f3\nla jefa\u201d y su canciller, obediente, implemento el plan porque fue \u201corden, orden y orden\". La evidencia reunida as\u00ed lo demuestra.\n\u2022\tQue tambi\u00e9n en forma paralela y para facilitar el plan de impunidad, se establecieron mecanismos de apoyo y protecci\u00f3n a los referentes de Ir\u00e1n en Argentina, producto de lo que se hab\u00eda acordado. \u00c9stos, conscientes de ello, afirmaron \u201cel gobierno ahora est\u00e1 a favor \u201c...el gobierno banca...'1'' y \u201c...Nosotros estamos ante un acuerdo con el gobierno nacional ...atr\u00e1s de una negociaci\u00f3n con el gobierno nacional...\u201d.\n\u2022\tQue este plan de encubrimiento e impunidad cont\u00f3 con la colaboraci\u00f3n indispensable de un grupo de individuos cuyas funciones y aportes viabilizaron el \u00e9xito del plan.\n\u2022\tQue Luis D\u2019El\u00eda, ac\u00e9rrimo defensor del r\u00e9gimen iran\u00ed y \u201csoldado\u201d incondicional de la Presidente -como \u00e9l se ha definido- fue el sujeto elegido para la transmisi\u00f3n y recepci\u00f3n de mensajes clandestinos a Ir\u00e1n. En sus palabras: \u201c...Yo tengo que hacer el juego de la Rosada...Si tengo orden de no ir, soy un soldado ac\u00e1...\u201d. D\u2019El\u00eda fue, en este plan, el interlocutor oculto y v\u00e1lido de las autoridades gubernamentales argentinas para resolver los obst\u00e1culos que iba presentando el \u201citer criminis\u201d. Consustanciado ideol\u00f3gicamente con ambas partes del pacto delictivo, estuvo varias veces en Ir\u00e1n. En una ocasi\u00f3n, invitado por el r\u00e9gimen, le ofrecieron un acuerdo similar al que luego firm\u00f3 Timerman, que ya inclu\u00eda el cese de las notificaciones rojas. En todas sus visitas a Ir\u00e1n, se entrevist\u00f3 con altas autoridades del r\u00e9gimen, se fotografi\u00f3 -entre otros- con el pr\u00f3fugo Mohsen Rabbani, con quien est\u00e1 relacionado hace a\u00f1os.\n\u2022\tQue su correlato del lado iran\u00ed fue Jorge Alejandro \u201cYussuf\u2019 Khalil, m\u00e1ximo referente local del r\u00e9gimen, \u201cla voz y o\u00eddos de Ir\u00e1n\u201d en nuestro pa\u00eds, incluso con mayor poder real que el ex Encargado de Negocios de Ir\u00e1n. Militante a tiempo completo de los intereses persas, cumpli\u00f3 id\u00e9nticas funciones que D\u2019El\u00eda en la transmisi\u00f3n de mensajes a trav\u00e9s de los canales paralelos de comunicaci\u00f3n y negociaci\u00f3n, operando -de ese modo- como el referente de la diplomacia paralela que comunica Buenos Aires con Teher\u00e1n, que fue aprovechada para la consecuci\u00f3n del plan de impunidad.\n\u2022\tQue el funcionario de inteligencia con acceso al entorno presidencial conocido como \u201cAlian\u201d, con informaci\u00f3n privilegiada -incluso sobre la salud de la Sra. Presidente-, ha declarado su simpat\u00eda con el r\u00e9gimen iran\u00ed y ha actuado -en reiteradas ocasiones- a favor de intereses extranjeros en detrimento de los nacionales. Funcion\u00f3 como nexo entre la Sra. Presidente y el referente local de Ir\u00e1n, Jorge Khalil, e impuls\u00f3 desde las sombras y siguiendo \u00f3rdenes de sus superiores, las acciones que aportaron al plan de impunidad. Explic\u00f3 lo que se pod\u00eda hacer y lo que no, lo que conven\u00eda y lo que podr\u00eda molestar. Explic\u00f3 tambi\u00e9n los pasos del gobierno, revel\u00f3 informaci\u00f3n sensible y secreta a agentes al servicio de una potencia extranjera, como Khalil, y viabiliz\u00f3 la ejecuci\u00f3n del encubrimiento, participando, en especial, en el armado de la nueva hip\u00f3tesis criminal, para desplazar la versi\u00f3n sostenida por la justicia nacional, en base a las pruebas de la causa, que se\u00f1ala la responsabilidad de ciudadanos iran\u00edes.\n\u2022\tQue el ex Fiscal designado, el d\u00eda del atentado, para actuar en forma conjunta, alterna o sucesiva en la causa AMIA, Dr. H\u00e9ctor Luis Yrimia, en raz\u00f3n de sus conocimientos detallados del expediente y su experiencia en la pr\u00e1ctica judicial en materia penal, por haberse desempe\u00f1ado adem\u00e1s como Juez de la Naci\u00f3n, aport\u00f3 valiosa\ninformaci\u00f3n y consejos t\u00e9cnicos para el armado de esta nueva hip\u00f3tesis falsa, de modo de tornarla veros\u00edmil y adaptable a la realidad de una causa judicial, que conoc\u00eda por haber intervenido en su condici\u00f3n de Fiscal Federal.\n\u2022\tQue Femando Esteche fue un facilitador del plan criminal, que contribuy\u00f3 activamente a encaminar las negociaciones en los canales paralelos. Tambi\u00e9n fue Esteche quien acerc\u00f3 a Khalil a los funcionarios de inteligencia argentinos, permitiendo que se genere una importante v\u00eda de contacto directo entre los agentes de ambos pa\u00edses. Fue \u00e9l quien sum\u00f3 al Dr. Yrimia al plan, con todo lo que ello redund\u00f3 en el perfeccionamiento de la pista falsa para redireccionar la investigaci\u00f3n, a la que -adem\u00e1s- aport\u00f3 ideas concretas.\n\u2022\tQue el Diputado Nacional Andr\u00e9s Larroque, contacto directo y asiduo con la Sra. Presidente de la Naci\u00f3n, por su cercan\u00eda y confianza fue elegido para cumplir el rol de nexo transmisor de las decisiones presidenciales a los ejecutores del plan criminal, a sabiendas de lo delictivas que eran. Se acreditaron distintos episodios en los que Larroque baj\u00f3 estas directivas presidenciales, tanto a Khalil como a D'El\u00eda, sobre c\u00f3mo deb\u00edan actuar. Como por ejemplo, la ocasi\u00f3n en que, en noviembre de 2012, Khalil reconoci\u00f3: \u201c...vengo de La Matanza reci\u00e9n he tenido una reuni\u00f3n con Luis D'El\u00eda y el \u201cCuervo \u201d Larroque, el de la C\u00e1mpora...que me llamaron temprano que quer\u00edan hablar conmigo, que ten\u00edan un mensaje para el gobierno para dar... Y ahora me voy para Mart\u00ednez a dar el mensaje, a la casa del Embajador...\u201d. Su intervenci\u00f3n ha sido indispensable para evitar, por precauci\u00f3n, un contacto directo entre autores y part\u00edcipes del encubrimiento.\nLas conclusiones expuestas no son otras que las que razonable y l\u00f3gicamente se derivan de un minucioso y detallado an\u00e1lisis de la prueba\ncolectada. Conforme habr\u00e1 podido apreciarse a lo largo de la denuncia, en la gran mayor\u00eda de los casos, dichas conclusiones surgen de prueba directa, mientras que en otros son el resultado de una serie de indicios y rigurosas deducciones l\u00f3gicas que, por ser graves, inequ\u00edvocos, precisos y concordantes con el resto de los elementos probatorios, contribuyen a solidificar la denuncia que se presenta.\nDe este modo, se exponen las acciones inescrupulosas y delictivas de autores y part\u00edcipes del encubrimiento que han vulnerado el derecho vigente, han ultrajado la memoria de las v\u00edctimas, han lucrado pol\u00edticamente con esas muertes y han abusado de la paciencia y buena fe de los sobrevivientes del atentado y familiares de las v\u00edctimas que buscan y esperan lo que, en definitiva, merecen: que se castigue con el m\u00e1ximo rigor de la ley a los responsables de este tenebroso acto de terrorismo.\nVII.\t- Breves consideraciones normativas\nAhora bien, conforme ya ha sido adelantado, el plan delictivo aqu\u00ed denunciado encuadra, a priori, en las figuras penales de encubrimiento por favorecimiento personal agravado, impedimento o estorbo del acto funcional e incumplimiento de los deberes de funcionario p\u00fablico (arts. 277 inciso 1 y 3, 241 inciso 2 y 248 del C\u00f3digo Penal).\nEn primer lugar, cabe se\u00f1alar que el encubrimiento por favorecimiento personal (art. 277 inc. 1) se encuentra agravado respecto de algunos de los encartados, por su calidad de funcionarios p\u00fablicos (art. 277 inc. 3o d); y -en todos los casos- por la especial gravedad del hecho precedente (art. 277 inc. 3o a). Como es sabido y aunque se configuran varias agravantes, \u00e9stas no concurren entre s\u00ed e imperar\u00e1 aquella que contenga -seg\u00fan el caso- mayores elementos de especialidad y abarque una mayor protecci\u00f3n del bien jur\u00eddico tratado.\n\n\nMinisterio P\u00fablico de la Naci\u00f3n\nEn segundo lugar, y solo en los casos de imputados que revistan la calidad de funcionarios p\u00fablicos, una o varias de las acciones atribuidas son conf\u00edgurativas del tipo penal previsto en el art. 248 del c\u00f3digo de fondo, en virtud de los deberes funcionales espec\u00edficos de cada cargo que fueron desatendidos en el curso del plan criminal. Ello, sin perjuicio, de la ulterior aplicaci\u00f3n de la normativa concursal vigente.\nEn tercer lugar, se entiende que la acci\u00f3n delictiva aqu\u00ed individualizada y denunciada, encuadra tambi\u00e9n en la figura de impedimento o estorbo del acto funcional (art. 241 inc. 2 del C\u00f3digo Penal), dado que constituye un atentado contra la libertad en el ejercicio de la funci\u00f3n p\u00fablica, en el caso, de la actividad jurisdiccional en torno al caso AMIA.\nEl normal desenvolvimiento de esa actividad desplegada por el juez Rodolfo Canicoba Corral y de la investigaci\u00f3n del atentado contra la sede de la AMIA, que constituye el objeto procesal de la causa, se ve - cuanto menos- estorbada por la ejecuci\u00f3n de un plan destinado a encubrir en el citado expediente a un grupo de imputados acusados de participar en el referido hecho de terrorismo.\nM\u00e1s a\u00fan, desde el momento en que se suscribi\u00f3 el acuerdo con Ir\u00e1n, a esta altura ya se sabe, un instrumento cardinal en la maniobra de encubrimiento, se consumaron serias afectaciones al normal desenvolvimiento de los intercambios de informaci\u00f3n, elementos y dem\u00e1s piezas probatorias relevantes para la pesquisa del caso \u201cAMIA\u201d, implementados a trav\u00e9s de los mecanismos de cooperaci\u00f3n judicial internacional.\nEl acuerdo firmado con Ir\u00e1n se traduce en restricciones y serias afectaciones a la recepci\u00f3n de informaci\u00f3n y documentaci\u00f3n probatoria aportada por terceros estados para ser agregada al expediente judicial.\nComo bien se sabe, el acuerdo con la Rep\u00fablica Isl\u00e1mica incluye, entre sus disposiciones, la obligaci\u00f3n de entregar la totalidad de las actuaciones en tr\u00e1mite ante la justicia argentina -no a los imputados, lo que corresponde por derecho- para su revisi\u00f3n por parte de la \u201cComisi\u00f3n de la\nVerdad\u201d prevista en el convenio, para su posterior comunicaci\u00f3n al gobierno de la Rep\u00fablica Isl\u00e1mica de Ir\u00e1n. Justamente, la eventual puesta en conocimiento de las autoridades iran\u00edes de informaciones, investigaciones, revelaciones y/o conclusiones elaboradas por organismos y/o agencias extranjeras, constituye una severa perturbaci\u00f3n a dichos canales internacionales que nutren a la causa de elementos probatorios de inter\u00e9s, lo que claramente se erige en una traba que opera en detrimento de la investigaci\u00f3n.\nHabida cuenta que en la presente denuncia se encuentra involucrada una persona que, conforme a las probanzas reunidas, pertenece a la Secretar\u00eda de Inteligencia, y que en tal car\u00e1cter ha tenido participaci\u00f3n activa en los hechos delictivos aqu\u00ed verificados; corresponde requerir al Sr. Secretario de Inteligencia de Presidencia de la Naci\u00f3n que autorice el acceso a la totalidad de la informaci\u00f3n respecto de esta persona (arts. 16 y 17 de la Ley 25.520).\nVII.\t- Medidas cautelares\na)\tEmbargo Preventivo:\nEn virtud de la gran cantidad de elementos de convicci\u00f3n que sustentan la presente denuncia, la extensi\u00f3n del da\u00f1o causado por el delito y la multiplicidad de v\u00edctimas afectadas, se impone requerir al Sr. Juez el dictado de un embargo preventivo sobre los bienes de autores y part\u00edcipes de este encubrimiento de un crimen de lesa humanidad para asegurar la indemnizaci\u00f3n del da\u00f1o material y moral causado a las v\u00edctimas y a sus familias (art. 29 del C\u00f3digo Penal) que una eventual - y en este caso, probable- sentencia condenatoria necesariamente deber\u00e1 ordenar. Por lo dem\u00e1s, la medida cautelar solicitada impedir\u00e1 que cualquiera de los\n\n\nMinisterio P\u00fablico de la Naci\u00f3n uberto nism/n\nFISCAL GENERAL/\nimputados practique, durante el proceso, maniobras destinadas a insolventarse y, de ese modo, eludir sus obligaciones jur\u00eddicas.\nEfectivamente, el c\u00f3digo ritual ha previsto de forma expresa la situaci\u00f3n f\u00e1ctica aqu\u00ed planteada en su art. 518 al establecer: \u201cAl dictar el auto de procesamiento, el juez ordenar\u00e1 el embargo de bienes del imputado...\u201d para agregar en su parte final: \u201c...las medidas cautelares podr\u00e1n dictarse antes del auto de procesamiento, cuando hubiere peligro en la demora y elementos de convicci\u00f3n suficientes que las justifiquen\u201d.\nEs decir, la ley autoriza la imposici\u00f3n de medidas cautelares de \u00edndole econ\u00f3mica, como el embargo preventivo, antes del dictado del auto de procesamiento. En esos casos exige la concurrencia de dos requisitos para su procedencia: que haya elementos de convicci\u00f3n que la justifiquen y que exista peligro en la demora.\nEl primer requisito se encuentra ampliamente verificado a partir de los s\u00f3lidos elementos probatorios aportados en la presente denuncia que da cuenta del comportamiento delictivo de los imputados quienes, conforme se ha demostrado, han realizado todo tipo de maniobras destinadas a destruir las imputaciones de la causa AMIA poniendo en ejecuci\u00f3n un sofisticado plan de encubrimiento cuyo objetivo es lograr la impunidad definitiva de los acusados iran\u00edes, violentando el derecho de las v\u00edctimas y sus familiares a lograr justicia.\nLa segunda exigencia -peligro en la demora- se encuentra acreditada por la naturaleza extraordinaria del hecho il\u00edcito denunciado, la entidad de los bienes jur\u00eddicos afectados y la falta total de escr\u00fapulos de los sujetos aqu\u00ed denunciados, lo que obliga al Sr. Juez a extremar los recaudos para evitar que nuevas maniobras y/o ardides dirigidos a la insolvencia personal de autores y part\u00edcipes de este delito perjudiquen nuevamente a las v\u00edctimas. As\u00ed, la demora en la aplicaci\u00f3n de la medida cautelar requerida tornar\u00eda incierto o incluso ilusorio el derecho a compensaci\u00f3n de las v\u00edctimas que supone una reparaci\u00f3n plena y efectiva, adem\u00e1s de apropiada y proporcional a la gravedad de la lesi\u00f3n.\nEs decir, cabe asumir con un alto grado de certeza que aquellas personas que no trepidaron en ejecutar un plan criminal de encubrimiento para destruir la investigaci\u00f3n principal por el atentado a la AMIA, hagan lo propio para salvaguardar sus patrimonios personales, escapando as\u00ed a las responsabilidades econ\u00f3micas derivadas de la comisi\u00f3n del delito denunciado. As\u00ed, el c\u00famulo probatorio que sustenta la presente denuncia justifica, por su propia solidez,\tla\taplicaci\u00f3n\tde la medida\tcautelar\nsolicitada.\nEn cuanto al monto\ta\tembargar,\tm\u00e1s all\u00e1 del\tcar\u00e1cter\npreventivo de la medida, lo cierto\tes\tque seg\u00fan\tla manda legal\tdebe ser\nsuficiente para garantizar la pena pecuniaria, la indemnizaci\u00f3n civil y las costas. En esa inteligencia para\testablecer la\tsuma resarcitoria debe\natenderse tanto a la gravedad del hecho perpetrado, a la trascendencia institucional que reviste como al significativo n\u00famero de v\u00edctimas, teni\u00e9ndose en cuenta el da\u00f1o efectivo sufrido m\u00e1s el da\u00f1o moral provocado por el delito.\nEn raz\u00f3n que resulta necesario efectuar una reparaci\u00f3n integral por el da\u00f1o causado, la multiplicidad de v\u00edctimas que se encuentran en posici\u00f3n de reclamar un resarcimiento por sus derechos afectados resulta determinante al momento de ponderar el monto del embargo.\nN\u00f3tese que existe una relaci\u00f3n directa entre el delito y la denegaci\u00f3n de justicia; que su duraci\u00f3n ya ha consumido, solo hasta el momento, 18 largos meses; y que algunas de las personas involucradas en la maniobra tienen una alt\u00edsima jerarqu\u00eda institucional en el gobierno nacional.\nEstos par\u00e1metros han de ser tomados en consideraci\u00f3n para calibrar adecuadamente la suma por la cual deben responder los acusados que, si bien resulta ser insusceptible de apreciaci\u00f3n pecuniaria objetiva, es el \u00fanico modo aceptado de reparaci\u00f3n frente a la angustia, la desesperanza y la impotencia de quienes tienen que soportar un nuevo encubrimiento en la investigaci\u00f3n del atentado contra la AMIA.\n\n\nEn atenci\u00f3n a que la obligaci\u00f3n de resarcir el da\u00f1o provocado es solidaria entre todos los responsables, entiendo adecuado la imposici\u00f3n de la suma de $200.000.000 (doscientos millones de pesos).\nb)\tProhibici\u00f3n de salida del pa\u00eds:\nA los efectos de asegurar desde el inicio los fines del proceso, corresponde solicitar que V.S. decrete la inmediata prohibici\u00f3n de salir del pa\u00eds de Luis \u00c1ngel D'El\u00eda, Fernando Luis Esteche, Jorge Alejandro \u201cYussuf\u2019 Khalil y H\u00e9ctor Luis Yrimia. El mismo temperamento corresponde adoptar respecto de \u201cAlian\u201d, quien deber\u00e1 ser correctamente individualizado y que, seg\u00fan los indicios obtenidos hasta el momento, podr\u00eda tratarse de Ram\u00f3n Alian H\u00e9ctor Bogado.\nEn relaci\u00f3n a los restantes imputados en esta presentaci\u00f3n - Cristina Elisabet Fern\u00e1ndez, H\u00e9ctor Marcos Timerman y Andr\u00e9s Larroque-, teniendo en cuenta los altos cargos p\u00fablicos que ejercen, como as\u00ed tambi\u00e9n los fueros de los se encuentran investidos, a juicio del suscripto, no se advierten -por el momento- circunstancias que ameriten asegurar su sujeci\u00f3n al proceso mediante esta medida. Ello, sin perjuicio de que el criterio aqu\u00ed articulado pueda modificarse, conforme a derecho.\nPor lo dem\u00e1s, la gravedad institucional de esta denuncia, en tanto involucra a un Presidente de la Naci\u00f3n y a un Ministro del Poder Ejecutivo Nacional en ejercicio y a otros funcionarios de alta jerarqu\u00eda dentro del gobierno nacional, no debe -sin embargo- convertirse en obst\u00e1culo para la investigaci\u00f3n judicial y el desempe\u00f1o de las tareas propias de un Poder Judicial independiente, m\u00e1xime teniendo en cuenta la seriedad de los hechos aqu\u00ed anoticiados. Muy por el contrario, la celeridad para aclarar estos graves hechos, resulta imperativa.\nFinalmente, se entiende corresponde formular la presente denuncia ante el Juzgado Nacional en lo Criminal y Correccional Federal N\u00b04 a cargo del Dr. Ariel Lijo, quien ya se encuentra interviniendo en relaci\u00f3n con hechos e irregularidades pasadas de esta investigaci\u00f3n, que\ntambi\u00e9n involucran falsas acusaciones para direccionar err\u00f3neamente la pesquisa y/o el encubrimiento de imputados para su protecci\u00f3n. Esas investigaciones, que tramitaron y -en parte a\u00fan tramitan- ante el Juzgado del Dr. Lijo, tienen identidad procesal con los hechos que aqu\u00ed se denuncian, en tanto tambi\u00e9n se refieren a actividades destinadas a encubrir a imputados por el atentado, aun cuando hayan sido desplegadas por distintos sujetos activos y en distintos momentos de la tramitaci\u00f3n de la pesquisa. Lo cierto es que en ambos casos, se trata de maniobras delictivas destinadas a entorpecer la investigaci\u00f3n judicial por el atentado contra la AMIA.\nEn este sentido, corresponde tener presente que el Ministerio P\u00fablico Fiscal es un \u00f3rgano independiente, con autonom\u00eda funcional y autarqu\u00eda financiera, que tiene por funci\u00f3n promover la actuaci\u00f3n de la justicia en defensa de la legalidad y de los intereses generales de la sociedad (art. 120 de la Constituci\u00f3n Nacional y Ley Nacional N\u00b0 24.946) y, en cumplimiento de esos mandatos funcionales y de lo normado en el art. 177 inc. Io del C\u00f3digo Procesal Penal, vengo a formular la presente denuncia, por considerar que los hechos aqu\u00ed expuestos encuentran \u201cprima facie\u201d adecuaci\u00f3n jur\u00eddica en las figuras de encubrimiento por favorecimiento personal agravado, impedimento o estorbo del acto funcional e incumplimiento de los deberes de funcionario p\u00fablico, previstas en los arts. 277 inc. 1 y 3, 241 inc. 2 y 248 del C\u00f3digo Penal.\nX- Petitorio;\nPor todo lo expuesto, solicito al Sr. Juez que:\nI.\t-\tSe tenga por formulada la presente denuncia en virtud del mandato dispuesto en el art. 177 inc.

going to lie, it'll probably get properly violent\nYou should eat your greens because you're lacking in iron, man\nI don't mean to talk beanstalks but I'm jacking your giant\nI've seen gore beyond belief\nWar machines torn up like magazines\nFragged to smithereens with C4\nRock you like a see-saw, rucking's what I breathe for\nDrop you into free fall and pop you when you respawn\nFree running and free gunning\nAmong the debris, becoming elite\nKeep running your mouth, I'll separate your gum and your teeth\nI find it funny you keep coming back for more\nLike Oliver Twist did when he risked it\n'Cause he really wanted something to eat\n\n\nAre you big enough?\nTell me, are you big enough to ruck with me?\nReckon you're big enough?\nTell me, are you big enough to ruck with me?\n\n\nYou're talking all that while I'm ignoring, walking tall\nWhile I'm taking great strides, you were barely taught to crawl\nI'm a fighter personified, warts and all\nYou've never fought a war in all your life\nWhy, we all can brawl\nYou've not got the balls to drop and fall\nHop from wall to wall\nAdrenaline is setting in a veritable smorgasboard\nOf fluids running through you like a sewer or a waterfall\nYou're short of all the gall you need and so, you're sure to fall\nCheck my vortex blocker\nIt could more or less stop a chopper\nWhile I take a break to make a mocha\nMake a mockery of you, you can't refuse\nI made an offer, leave you shaking, quaking\nMate, you need to take your beta blockers\nYou might also like\nAre you big enough?\nTell me, are you big enough to ruck with me?\nReckon you're big enough?\nTell me, are you big enough to ruck with me?\n\n\nYeah, I think you're rather justified in feeling mugged off\nEvery attack you tactically attacked with, Atlas shrugged off\nSo, spray me with deodorant, that stuff just rubs off\nI stride up in my Stryder and tear your lugs off\nMy smart pistol is ripping and pulling apart gristle\nLeave a dark ripple in your chest, you need kevlar nipples\nI blast missiles at trolls for laughs, giggles and LOLs\nSo, I wouldn't advise getting involved if you're not MLG\nMGL, a shower of empty shells as everyone around me's\nShredded into bits and sent to Hell\nNo one's ever started something with me that ever ended well\nWhatever pilot or Titan tried it, in the end, they fell\n\n\nAre you big enough?\nTell me, are you big enough to ruck with me?\nReckon you're big enough?\nTell me, are you big enough to ruck with me?\n\nAre you big enough?\nTell me, are you big enough to ruck with me?\nReckon you're big
